In 1908 he began his studies in aeronautical\nengineering at Manchester University where his interest in the\nphilosophy of pure mathematics led him to Frege. Upon Frege\u2019s\nadvice, in 1911 he went to Cambridge to study with Bertrand\nRussell. Russell wrote, upon meeting Wittgenstein: \u201cAn unknown\nGerman appeared \u2026 obstinate and perverse, but I think not\nstupid\u201d (quoted by Monk 1990: 38f). Within one year, Russell was\ncommitted: \u201cI shall certainly encourage him. Perhaps he will do\ngreat things \u2026 I love him and feel he will solve the problems I\nam too old to solve\u201d (quoted by Monk 1990: 41). Russell\u2019s\ninsight was accurate. Wittgenstein was idiosyncratic in his habits and\nway of life, yet profoundly acute in his philosophical\nsensitivity.</p>", "<p>\n\nDuring his years in Cambridge, from 1911 to 1913, Wittgenstein\nconducted several conversations on philosophy and the foundations of\nlogic with Russell, with whom he had an emotional and intense\nrelationship, as well as with Moore and Keynes. He retreated to\nisolation in Norway, for months at a time, in order to ponder these\nphilosophical problems and to work out their solutions. In 1913 he\nreturned to Austria and in 1914, at the start of World War I\n(1914\u20131918), joined the Austrian army. He was taken captive in 1918\nand spent the remaining months of the war at a prison camp. It was\nduring the war that he wrote the notes and drafts of his first\nimportant work, <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>. After the war\nthe book was published in German and translated into English.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn 1920 Wittgenstein, now divorced from philosophy (having, to his\nmind, solved all philosophical problems in the <em>Tractatus</em>),\ngave away his part of his family\u2019s fortune and pursued several\n\u2018professions\u2019 (gardener, teacher, architect, etc.) in and\naround Vienna. It was only in 1929 that he returned to Cambridge to\nresume his philosophical vocation, after having been exposed to\ndiscussions on the philosophy of mathematics and science with members\nof the Vienna Circle, whose conception of logical empiricism was\nindebted to his <em>Tractatus</em> account of logic as tautologous,\nand his philosophy as concerned with logical syntax. During these\nfirst years in Cambridge his conception of philosophy and its problems\nunderwent dramatic changes that are recorded in several volumes of\nconversations, lecture notes, and letters (e.g., <em>Ludwig\nWittgenstein and the Vienna Circle</em>, <em>The Blue and Brown\nBooks</em>, <em>Philosophical Grammar</em>).  Sometimes termed the\n\u2018middle Wittgenstein\u2019, this period heralds a rejection of\ndogmatic philosophy, including both traditional works and the\n<em>Tractatus</em> itself.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn the 1930s and 1940s Wittgenstein conducted seminars at\nCambridge, developing most of the ideas that he intended to publish in\nhis second book, <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. These included\nthe turn from formal logic to ordinary language, novel reflections on\npsychology and mathematics, and a general skepticism concerning\nphilosophy\u2019s pretensions. In 1945 he prepared the final manuscript of\nthe <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, but, at the last minute,\nwithdrew it from publication (and only authorized its posthumous\npublication). For a few more years he continued his philosophical work,\nbut this is marked by a rich development of, rather than a turn away\nfrom, his second phase. He traveled during this period to the United\nStates and Ireland, and returned to Cambridge, where he was diagnosed\nwith cancer. Legend has it that, at his death in 1951, his last words\nwere \u201cTell them I\u2019ve had a wonderful life\u201d (Monk: 579).</p>", "<p>\n<em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> was first published in German\nin 1921 and then translated\u2014by C.K. Ogden, with\nF. P. Ramsey\u2019s help\u2014and published in English in 1922. It\nwas later re-translated by D.  F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness. Coming\nout of Wittgenstein\u2019s <em>Notes on Logic</em> (1913),\n\u201cNotes Dictated to G. E. Moore\u201d (1914),\nhis <em>Notebooks</em>, written in 1914\u201316, and further correspondence\nwith Russell, Moore and Keynes, and showing Schopenhauerian and other\ncultural influences, it evolved as a continuation of and reaction to\nRussell and Frege\u2019s conceptions of logic and language. Russell\nsupplied an introduction to the book claiming that it \u201ccertainly\ndeserves \u2026 to be considered an important event in the\nphilosophical world.\u201d It is fascinating to note that\nWittgenstein thought little of Russell\u2019s introduction, claiming\nthat it was riddled with misunderstandings. Later interpretations have\nattempted to unearth the surprising tensions between the introduction\nand the rest of the book (or between Russell\u2019s reading of\nWittgenstein and Wittgenstein\u2019s own\nself-assessment)\u2014usually harping on Russell\u2019s\nappropriation of Wittgenstein for his own agenda. </p>", "<p>\n\nThe <em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s structure purports to be representative of\nits internal essence. It is constructed around seven basic\npropositions, numbered by the natural numbers 1\u20137, with all other\nparagraphs in the text numbered by decimal expansions so that, e.g.,\nparagraph 1.1 is (supposed to be) a further elaboration on proposition\n1, 1.22 is an elaboration of 1.2, and so on.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe seven basic propositions are:</p>", "<table class=\"centered vert-top\">\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td><strong>Ogden translation</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Pears/McGuinness translation</strong></td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>1.</td>\n<td>The world is everything that is the case.</td>\n<td>The world is all that is the case.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>2.</td>\n<td>What is the case, the fact, is the existence of atomic facts.</td>\n<td>What is the case\u2014a fact\u2014is the existence of states of\naffairs. </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>3.</td>\n<td>The logical picture of the facts is the thought.</td>\n<td>A logical picture of facts is a thought. </td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>4.</td>\n<td>The thought is the significant proposition.</td>\n<td>A thought is a proposition with sense.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>5.</td>\n<td>Propositions are truth-functions of elementary propositions.</td>\n<td>A proposition is a truth-function of elementary propositions.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>(An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.)</td>\n<td>(An elementary proposition is a truth function of itself.)</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>6.</td>\n<td>The general form of truth-function is\n \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi}, N(\\bar{\\xi})]\\).</td>\n<td>The general form of a truth-function is\n \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi}, N(\\bar{\\xi})]\\).</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td></td>\n<td>This is the general form of proposition.</td>\n<td>This is the general form of a proposition.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>7.</td>\n<td>Whereof one cannot speak, thereof one must be silent.</td>\n<td>What we cannot speak about we must pass over in\nsilence.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>", "<p>\n\nClearly, the book addresses the central problems of philosophy which\ndeal with the world, thought and language, and presents a \u2018solution\u2019\n(as Wittgenstein terms it) of these problems that is grounded in logic\nand in the nature of representation. The world is represented by\nthought, which is a proposition with sense, since they all\u2014world,\nthought, and proposition\u2014share the same logical form. Hence, the\nthought and the proposition can be pictures of the facts.</p>", "<p>\n\nStarting with a seeming metaphysics, Wittgenstein sees the world as\nconsisting of facts (1), rather than the traditional, atomistic\nconception of a world made up of objects. Facts are existent states of\naffairs (2) and states of affairs, in turn, are combinations of\nobjects. \u201cObjects are simple\u201d (<em>TLP</em>\n2.02) but objects can fit together in various determinate ways. They\nmay have various properties and may hold diverse relations to one\nanother.  Objects combine with one another according to their logical,\ninternal properties. That is to say, an object\u2019s internal properties\ndetermine the possibilities of its combination with other objects;\nthis is its logical form. Thus, states of affairs, being comprised of\nobjects in combination, are inherently complex. The states of affairs\nwhich do exist could have been otherwise. This means that states of\naffairs are either actual (existent) or possible. It is the totality\nof states of affairs\u2014actual and possible\u2014that makes up\nthe whole of reality.  The world is precisely those states of affairs\nwhich do exist.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe move to thought, and thereafter to language, is perpetrated with\nthe use of Wittgenstein\u2019s famous idea that thoughts, and propositions,\nare pictures\u2014\u201cthe picture is a model of reality\u201d (<em>TLP</em>\n2.12). Pictures are made up of elements that together constitute the\npicture. Each element represents an object, and the combination of\nelements in the picture represents the combination of objects in a\nstate of affairs. The logical structure of the picture, whether in\nthought or in language, is isomorphic with the logical structure of\nthe state of affairs which it pictures. More subtle is Wittgenstein\u2019s\ninsight that the possibility of this structure being shared by the\npicture (the thought, the proposition) and the state of affairs is the\npictorial form. \u201c<em>That</em> is how a picture is attached to\nreality; it reaches right out to it\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 2.1511). This leads\nto an understanding of what the picture can picture; but also what it\ncannot\u2014its own pictorial form.</p>", "<p>\n\nWhile \u201cthe logical picture of the facts is the thought\u201d (3), in the\nmove to language Wittgenstein continues to investigate the\npossibilities of significance for propositions (4). Logical analysis,\nin the spirit of Frege and Russell, guides the work, with Wittgenstein\nusing logical calculus to carry out the construction of his system.\nExplaining that \u201cOnly the proposition has sense; only in the context of\na proposition has a name meaning\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 3.3), he provides the\nreader with the two conditions for sensical language. First, the\nstructure of the proposition must conform to the constraints of\nlogical form, and second, the elements of the proposition must have\nreference (<em>bedeutung</em>). These conditions have far-reaching\nimplications. The analysis must culminate with a name being a primitive\nsymbol for a (simple) object. Moreover, logic itself gives us the\nstructure and limits of what can be said at all.</p>", "<p>\n\n\u201cThe general form of a proposition is: This is how things\nstand\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 4.5) and every proposition is either true\nor false. This bi-polarity of propositions enables the composition of\nmore complex propositions from atomic ones by using truth-functional\noperators (5). Wittgenstein supplies, in the <em>Tractatus</em>, a\nvivid presentation of Frege\u2019s logic in the form of what has become\nknown as \u2018truth-tables\u2019. This provides the means to go\nback and analyze all propositions into their atomic parts, since\n\u201cevery statement about complexes can be analyzed into a\nstatement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions\nwhich completely describe the complexes\u201d (<em>TLP</em>\n2.0201). He delves even deeper by then providing the general form of a\ntruth-function (6). This form, \\([\\bar{p}, \\bar{\\xi}, N(\\bar{\\xi})]\\),\nmakes use of one formal operation \\((N(\\bar{\\xi}))\\)\nand one propositional variable \\((\\bar{p})\\)\nto represent Wittgenstein\u2019s claim that any proposition \u201cis the result\nof successive applications\u201d of logical operations to elementary\npropositions.</p>", "<p>\n\nHaving developed this analysis of world-thought-language, and\nrelying on the one general form of the proposition, Wittgenstein can\nnow assert that all meaningful propositions are of equal value.\nSubsequently, he ends the journey with the admonition concerning what\ncan (or cannot) and what should (or should not) be said (7), leaving\noutside the realm of the sayable propositions of ethics, aesthetics,\nand metaphysics.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn the <em>Tractatus</em> Wittgenstein\u2019s logical construction of a\nphilosophical system has a purpose\u2014to find the limits of\nworld, thought and language; in other words, to distinguish between\nsense and nonsense. \u201cThe book will \u2026 draw a limit to thinking,\nor rather\u2014not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts\n\u2026. The limit can \u2026 only be drawn in language and what\nlies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense\u201d\n(<em>TLP</em> Preface). The conditions for a proposition\u2019s having\nsense have been explored and seen to rest on the possibility of\nrepresentation or picturing. Names must have a <em>bedeutung</em>\n(reference/meaning), but they can only do so in the context of a\nproposition which is held together by logical form. It follows that\nonly factual states of affairs which can be pictured can be\nrepresented by meaningful propositions. This means that what can be\nsaid are only propositions of natural science and leaves out of the\nrealm of sense a daunting number of statements which are made and used\nin language.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere are, first, the propositions of logic itself. These do not\nrepresent states of affairs, and the logical constants do not stand\nfor objects.  \u201cMy fundamental thought is that the logical\nconstants do not represent.  That the <em>logic</em> of the facts\ncannot be represented\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 4.0312). This is not a\nhappenstance thought; it is fundamental precisely because the limits\nof sense rest on logic.  Tautologies and contradictions, the\npropositions of logic, are the limits of language and thought, and\nthereby the limits of the world.  Obviously, then, they do not picture\nanything and do not, therefore, have sense. They are, in\nWittgenstein\u2019s terms, senseless (<em>sinnlos</em>). Propositions which\ndo have sense are bipolar; they range within the truth-conditions\ndrawn by the truth-tables.  But the propositions of logic themselves\nare \u201cnot pictures of the reality \u2026 for the one\nallows <em>every</em> possible state of affairs, the\nother <em>none</em>\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 4.462). Indeed, tautologies\n(and contradictions), being senseless, are recognized as true (or\nfalse) \u201cin the symbol alone \u2026 and this fact contains in\nitself the whole philosophy of logic\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 6.113).</p>", "<p>\n\nThe characteristic of being senseless applies not only to the\npropositions of logic but also to mathematics or the pictorial form itself of the\npictures that do represent. These are, like tautologies and\ncontradictions, literally sense-less, they have no sense.</p>", "<p>\n\nBeyond, or aside from, senseless propositions Wittgenstein identifies\nanother group of statements which cannot carry sense: the nonsensical\n(<em>unsinnig</em>) propositions. Nonsense, as opposed to\nsenselessness, is encountered when a proposition is even more\nradically devoid of meaning, when it transcends the bounds of\nsense. Under the label of <em>unsinnig</em> can be found various\npropositions: \u201cSocrates is identical\u201d, but also \u201c1\nis a number\u201d and \u201cthere are objects\u201d. While some\nnonsensical propositions are blatantly so, others seem to be\nmeaningful\u2014and only analysis carried out in accordance with the\npicture theory can expose their nonsensicality. Since only what is\n\u201cin\u201d the world can be described, anything that is\n\u201chigher\u201d is excluded, including the notion of limit and\nthe limit points themselves. Traditional metaphysics, and the\npropositions of ethics and aesthetics, which try to capture the world\nas a whole, are also excluded, as is the truth in solipsism, the very\nnotion of a subject, for it is also not \u201cin\u201d the world but\nat its limit.</p>", "<p>\n\nWittgenstein does not, however, relegate all that is not inside the\nbounds of sense to oblivion. He makes a distinction between\n<em>saying</em> and <em>showing</em> which is made to do additional\ncrucial work. \u201cWhat can be shown cannot be said,\u201d that is,\nwhat cannot be formulated in sayable (sensical) propositions can only\nbe shown. This applies, for example, to the logical form of the world,\nthe pictorial form, etc., which show themselves in the form of\n(contingent) propositions, in the symbolism, and in logical\npropositions. Even the unsayable (metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic)\npropositions of philosophy belong in this group\u2014which\nWittgenstein finally describes as \u201cthings that cannot be put\ninto words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is\nmystical\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 6.522).</p>", "<p>\n\nAccordingly, \u201cthe word \u2018philosophy\u2019 must mean something\nwhich stands above or below, but not beside the natural sciences\u201d\n(<em>TLP</em> 4.111). Not surprisingly, then, \u201cmost of the\npropositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not\nfalse but nonsensical\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 4.003). Is, then, philosophy\ndoomed to be nonsense (<em>unsinnig</em>), or, at best, senseless\n(<em>sinnlos</em>) when it does logic, but, in any case, meaningless?\nWhat is left for the philosopher to do, if traditional, or even\nrevolutionary, propositions of metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics,\nand ethics cannot be formulated in a sensical manner? The reply to\nthese two questions is found in Wittgenstein\u2019s characterization of\nphilosophy: philosophy is not a theory, or a doctrine, but rather an\nactivity. It is an activity of clarification (of thoughts), and more\nso, of critique (of language).  Described by Wittgenstein, it should\nbe the philosopher\u2019s routine activity: to react or respond to the\ntraditional philosophers\u2019 musings by showing them where they go wrong,\nusing the tools provided by logical analysis. In other words, by\nshowing them that (some of) their propositions are nonsense.</p>", "<p>\n\n\u201cAll propositions are of equal value\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 6.4)\u2014that\ncould also be the fundamental thought of the book. For it employs a\nmeasure of the value of propositions that is done by logic and the\nnotion of limits. It is here, however, with the constraints on the\nvalue of propositions, that the tension in the <em>Tractatus</em> is\nmost strongly felt. It becomes clear that the notions used by the\n<em>Tractatus</em>\u2014the logical-philosophical notions\u2014do\nnot belong to the world and hence cannot be used to express anything\nmeaningful. Since language, thought and the world, are all isomorphic,\nany attempt to say in logic (i.e., in language) \u201cthis and this there\nis in the world, that there is not\u201d is doomed to be a failure, since\nit would mean that logic has got outside the limits of the world,\ni.e. of itself. That is to say, the <em>Tractatus</em> has gone over\nits own limits, and stands in danger of being nonsensical.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe \u201csolution\u201d to this tension is found in Wittgenstein\u2019s final\nremarks, where he uses the metaphor of the ladder to express the\nfunction of the <em>Tractatus</em>. It is to be used in order to climb\non it, in order to \u201csee the world rightly\u201d; but thereafter it must be\nrecognized as nonsense and be thrown away. Hence: \u201cwhereof one cannot\nspeak, thereof one must be silent\u201d (7).</p>", "<p>\n\nThe <em>Tractatus</em> is notorious for its interpretative\ndifficulties. In the decades that have passed since its\npublication it has gone through several waves of general\ninterpretations. Beyond exegetical and hermeneutical issues that\nrevolve around particular sections (such as the world/reality\ndistinction, the difference between representing and presenting, the\nFrege/Russell connection to Wittgenstein, or the influence on\nWittgenstein by existentialist philosophy) there are a few\nfundamental, not unrelated, disagreements that inform the map of\ninterpretation.  These revolve around the realism of the\n<em>Tractatus</em>, the notion of nonsense and its role in reading the\n<em>Tractatus</em> itself, and the reading of the <em>Tractatus</em>\nas an ethical tract.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere are interpretations that see the <em>Tractatus</em> as espousing\nrealism, i.e., as positing the independent existence of objects,\nstates of affairs, and facts. That this realism is achieved via a\nlinguistic turn is recognized by all (or most) interpreters, but this\nlinguistic perspective does no damage to the basic realism that is\nseen to start off the <em>Tractatus</em> (\u201cThe world is all that is\nthe case\u201d) and to run throughout the text (\u201cObjects form the substance\nof the world\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 2.021)). Such realism is also taken to be\nmanifested in the essential bi-polarity of propositions; likewise, a\nstraightforward reading of the picturing relation posits objects there\nto be represented by signs. As against these readings, more\nlinguistically oriented interpretations give conceptual priority to\nthe symbolism. When \u201creality is compared with propositions\u201d\n(<em>TLP</em> 4.05), it is the form of propositions which determines\nthe shape of reality (and not the other way round). In any case, the\nissue of realism (vs. anti-realism) in the <em>Tractatus</em> must\naddress the question of the limits of language and the more particular\nquestion of what there is (or is not) beyond language. Subsequently,\ninterpreters of the <em>Tractatus</em> have moved on to questioning\nthe very presence of metaphysics within the book and the status of the\npropositions of the book themselves.</p>", "<p>\n\n\u2018Nonsense\u2019 became the hinge of Wittgensteinian\ninterpretative discussion during the last decade of the 20th century.\nBeyond the bounds of language lies nonsense\u2014propositions which\ncannot picture <em>anything</em>\u2014and Wittgenstein bans\ntraditional metaphysics to that area. The quandary arises concerning\nthe question of what it is that inhabits that realm of nonsense, since\nWittgenstein does seem to be saying that there is something there to\nbe shown (rather than said) and does, indeed, characterize it as the\n\u2018mystical\u2019. The traditional readings of the\n<em>Tractatus</em> accepted, with varying degrees of discomfort, the\nexistence of that which is unsayable, that which cannot be put into\nwords, the nonsensical. More recent readings tend to take nonsense\nmore seriously as exactly that\u2014nonsense. This also entails\ntaking seriously Wittgenstein\u2019s words in 6.54\u2014his famous ladder\nmetaphor\u2014and throwing out the <em>Tractatus</em> itself,\nincluding the distinction between what can be said and what can only\nbe shown. The <em>Tractatus</em>, on this stance, does not point at\nineffable truths (of, e.g., metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, etc.),\nbut should lead us away from such temptations.  An accompanying\ndiscussion must then also deal with how this can be recognized, what\nthis can possibly mean, and how it should be used, if at all.</p>", "<p>\n\nThis discussion is closely related to what has come to be called the\nethical reading of the <em>Tractatus</em>. Such a reading is based,\nfirst, on the supposed discrepancy between Wittgenstein\u2019s construction\nof a world-language system, which takes up the bulk of the\n<em>Tractatus</em>, and several comments that are made about this\nconstruction in the Preface to the book, in its closing remarks, and\nin a letter he sent to his publisher, Ludwig von Ficker, before\npublication. In these places, all of which can be viewed as external\nto the content of the <em>Tractatus</em>, Wittgenstein preaches\nsilence as regards anything that is of importance, including the\n\u2018internal\u2019 parts of the book which contain, in his own\nwords, \u201cthe final solution of the problems [of\nphilosophy].\u201d It is the importance given to the ineffable that\ncan be viewed as an ethical position. \u201cMy work consists of two\nparts, the one presented here plus all that I have <em>not</em>\nwritten. And it is precisely this second part that is the important\npoint. For the ethical gets its limit drawn from the inside, as it\nwere, by my book; \u2026 I\u2019ve managed in my book to put everything\nfirmly into place by being silent about it \u2026. For now I would\nrecommend you to read the <em>preface</em> and\nthe <em>conclusion</em>, because they contain the most direct\nexpression of the point\u201d (<em>ProtoTractatus</em>,\np.16). Obviously, such seemingly contradictory tensions within and\nabout a text\u2014written by its author\u2014give rise to\ninterpretative conundrums.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere is another issue often debated by interpreters of Wittgenstein,\nwhich arises out of the questions above. This has to do with the\ncontinuity between the thought of the early and later\nWittgenstein. Again, the \u2018standard\u2019 interpretations were\noriginally united in perceiving a clear break between the two distinct\nstages of Wittgenstein\u2019s thought, even when ascertaining some\ndevelopmental continuity between them. And again, the more recent\ninterpretations challenge this standard, emphasizing that the\nfundamental therapeutic motivation clearly found in the later\nWittgenstein should also be attributed to the early.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe idea that philosophy is not a doctrine, and hence should not be\napproached dogmatically, is one of the most important insights of the\n<em>Tractatus</em>. Yet, as early as 1931, Wittgenstein referred to\nhis own early work as \u2018dogmatic\u2019 (\u201cOn\nDogmatism\u201d in <em>VC</em>, p. 182). Wittgenstein used this term\nto designate any conception which allows for a gap between question\nand answer, such that the answer to the question could be found at a\nlater date. The complex edifice of the <em>Tractatus</em> is built on\nthe assumption that the task of logical analysis was to discover the\nelementary propositions, whose form was not yet known. What marks the\ntransition from early to later Wittgenstein can be summed up as the\n<em>total</em> rejection of dogmatism, i.e., as the working out of\n<em>all</em> the consequences of this rejection. The move from the\nrealm of logic to that of ordinary language as the center of the\nphilosopher\u2019s attention; from an emphasis on definition and analysis\nto \u2018family resemblance\u2019 and \u2018language-games\u2019;\nand from systematic philosophical writing to an aphoristic\nstyle\u2014all have to do with this transition towards anti-dogmatism\nin its extreme. It is in the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>\nthat the working out of the transitions comes to culmination. Other\nwritings of the same period, though, manifest the same anti-dogmatic\nstance, as it is applied, e.g., to the philosophy of mathematics or to\nphilosophical psychology.</p>", "<p>\n<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> was published posthumously in\n1953. It was edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees and translated\nby Anscombe. It comprised two parts. Part I, consisting of 693\nnumbered paragraphs, was ready for printing in 1946, but rescinded\nfrom the publisher by Wittgenstein. Part II was added on by the\neditors, trustees of his <em>Nachlass</em>. In 2009 a new edited\ntranslation, by P. M. S. Hacker and Joachim Schulte, was published;\nPart II of the earlier translation was here labeled \u201cPhilosophy\nof Psychology \u2013 A Fragment\u201d (PPF).</p>", "<p>\n\nIn the Preface to <em>PI</em>, Wittgenstein states that his new\nthoughts would be better understood by contrast with and against the\nbackground of his old thoughts, those in the <em>Tractatus</em>; and\nindeed, most of Part I of <em>PI</em> is essentially critical. Its new\ninsights can be understood as primarily exposing fallacies in the\ntraditional way of thinking about language, truth, thought,\nintentionality, and, perhaps mainly, philosophy. In this sense, it is\nconceived of as a <em>therapeutic</em> work, viewing philosophy itself\nas <em>therapy</em>. (Part II (PPF), focusing on philosophical psychology,\nperception etc., was not as critical. Rather, it pointed to new\nperspectives (which, undoubtedly, are not disconnected from the\nearlier critique) in addressing specific philosophical issues.  It is,\ntherefore, more easily read alongside Wittgenstein\u2019s other writings of\nthe later period.)</p>", "<p>\n\n<em>PI</em> begins with a quote from Augustine\u2019s <em>Confessions</em>\nwhich \u201cgive us a particular picture of the essence of human language,\u201d\nbased on the idea that \u201cthe words in language name objects,\u201d\nand that \u201csentences are combinations of such names\u201d (<em>PI</em>\n1). This picture of language cannot be relied on as a basis for\nmetaphysical, epistemic or linguistic speculation. Despite its\nplausibility, this reduction of language to representation cannot do\njustice to the whole of human language; and even if it is to be\nconsidered a picture of only the representative function of human\nlanguage, it is, as such, a poor picture. Furthermore, this picture of\nlanguage is at the base of the whole of traditional philosophy, but,\nfor Wittgenstein, it is to be shunned in favor of a new way of looking\nat both language and philosophy. The <em>Philosophical\nInvestigations</em> proceeds to offer the new way of looking at\nlanguage, which will yield the view of philosophy as therapy.</p>", "<p>\n\n\u201cFor a <em>large</em> class of cases of the employment of the\nword \u2018meaning\u2019\u2014though not for all\u2014this word can\nbe explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the\nlanguage\u201d (<em>PI</em> 43). This basic statement is what\nunderlies the change of perspective most typical of the later phase of\nWittgenstein\u2019s thought: a change from a conception of meaning as\nrepresentation to a view which looks to use as the crux of the\ninvestigation. Traditional theories of meaning in the history of\nphilosophy were intent on pointing to something exterior to the\nproposition which endows it with sense. This \u2018something\u2019\ncould generally be located either in an objective space, or inside the\nmind as mental representation. As early as 1933 (<em>The Blue\nBook</em>) Wittgenstein took pains to challenge these conceptions,\narriving at the insight that \u201cif we had to name anything which\nis the life of the sign, we should have to say that it was its\n<em>use</em>\u201d (<em>BB</em> 4).  Ascertainment of the use (of a\nword, of a proposition), however, is not given to any sort of\nconstructive theory building, as in the <em>Tractatus</em>. Rather,\nwhen investigating meaning, the philosopher must \u201clook and\nsee\u201d the variety of uses to which the word is put. An analogy\nwith tools sheds light on the nature of words. When we think of tools\nin a toolbox, we do not fail to see their variety; but the\n\u201cfunctions of words are as diverse as the functions of these\nobjects\u201d (<em>PI</em> 11). We are misled by the uniform\nappearance of our words into theorizing upon meaning:\n\u201cEspecially when we are doing philosophy!\u201d (<em>PI</em>\n12) </p>", "<p>\n\nSo different is this new perspective that Wittgenstein repeats:\n\u201cDon\u2019t think, but look!\u201d (<em>PI</em> 66); and such\nlooking is done <em>vis a vis</em> particular cases, not\ngeneralizations. In giving the meaning of a word, any explanatory\ngeneralization should be replaced by a description of use. The\ntraditional idea that a proposition houses a content and has a\nrestricted number of Fregean forces (such as assertion, question and\ncommand), gives way to an emphasis on the diversity of uses. In order\nto address the countless multiplicity of uses, their un-fixedness, and\ntheir being part of an activity, Wittgenstein introduces the key\nconcept of \u2018language-game\u2019. He never explicitly defines it\nsince, as opposed to the earlier \u2018picture\u2019, for instance,\nthis new concept is made to do work for a more fluid, more\ndiversified, and more activity-oriented perspective on language.</p>", "<p>\n\nThroughout the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, Wittgenstein\nreturns, again and again, to the concept of language-games to make\nclear his lines of thought concerning language. Primitive\nlanguage-games are scrutinized for the insights they afford on this or\nthat characteristic of language. Thus, the builders\u2019 language-game\n(<em>PI</em> 2), in which a builder and his assistant use exactly four\nterms (block, pillar, slab, beam), is utilized to illustrate that part\nof the Augustinian picture of language which might be correct but\nwhich is, nevertheless, strictly limited. \u2018Regular\u2019\nlanguage-games, such as the astonishing list provided in <em>PI</em>\n23 (which includes, e.g., reporting an event, speculating about an\nevent, forming and testing a hypothesis, making up a story, reading\nit, play-acting, singing catches, guessing riddles, making a joke,\ntranslating, asking, thanking, and so on), bring out the openness of\nour possibilities in using language and in describing it.</p>", "<p>\n\nLanguage-games are, first, a part of a broader context termed by\nWittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of\nlanguage-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This\ndoes not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and\nevery language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this\nsort of human activity. Still, just as we cannot give a final,\nessential definition of \u2018game\u2019, so we cannot find\n\u201cwhat is common to all these activities and what makes them into\nlanguage or parts of language\u201d (<em>PI</em> 65).</p>", "<p>\n\nIt is here that Wittgenstein\u2019s rejection of general explanations, and\ndefinitions based on sufficient and necessary conditions, is best\npronounced. Instead of these symptoms of the philosopher\u2019s \u201ccraving\nfor generality\u201d, he points to \u2018family resemblance\u2019 as the\nmore suitable analogy for the means of connecting particular uses of\nthe same word. There is no reason to look, as we have done\ntraditionally\u2014and dogmatically\u2014for one, essential core\nin which the meaning of a word is located and which is, therefore,\ncommon to all uses of that word. We should, instead, travel with the\nword\u2019s uses through \u201ca complicated network of similarities\noverlapping and criss-crossing\u201d (<em>PI</em> 66). Family resemblance\nalso serves to exhibit the lack of boundaries and the distance from\nexactness that characterize different uses of the same concept. Such\nboundaries and exactness are the definitive traits of form\u2014be\nit Platonic form, Aristotelian form, or the general form of a\nproposition adumbrated in the <em>Tractatus</em>.  It is from such\nforms that applications of concepts can be deduced, but this is\nprecisely what Wittgenstein now eschews in favor of appeal to\nsimilarity of a kind with family resemblance.</p>", "<p>\n\nOne of the issues most associated with the later Wittgenstein is that\nof rule-following. Rising out of the considerations above, it becomes\nanother central point of discussion in the question of what it is that\ncan apply to all the uses of a word. The same dogmatic stance as before\nhas it that a rule is an abstract entity\u2014transcending all of its\nparticular applications; knowing the rule involves grasping that\nabstract entity and thereby knowing how to use it. </p>", "<p>\n\nWittgenstein begins his exposition by introducing an example:\n\u201c\u2026 we get [a] pupil to continue a series (say \u2018+\n2\u2019) beyond 1000\u2014and he writes 1000, 1004, 1008, 1012\n(<em>PI</em> 185)\u201d. What do we do, and what does it mean, when\nthe student, upon being corrected, answers \u201cBut I did go on in\nthe same way\u201d? Wittgenstein proceeds (mainly in <em>PI</em>\n185\u2013243, but also elsewhere) to dismantle the cluster of attendant\nquestions: How do we learn rules?  How do we follow them?  Wherefrom\nthe standards which decide if a rule is followed correctly?  Are they\nin the mind, along with a mental representation of the rule?  Do we\nappeal to intuition in their application? Are they socially and\npublicly taught and enforced? In typical Wittgensteinian fashion, the\nanswers are not pursued positively; rather, the very formulation of\nthe questions as legitimate questions with coherent content is put to\nthe test. For indeed, it is both the Platonistic and mentalistic\npictures which underlie asking questions of this type, and\nWittgenstein is intent on freeing us from these assumptions. Such\nliberation involves elimination of the need to posit any sort of\nexternal or internal authority beyond the actual applications of the\nrule.</p>", "<p>\n\nThese considerations lead to <em>PI</em> 201, often considered the\nclimax of the issue: \u201cThis was our paradox: no course of action\ncould be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be\nmade out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be\nmade out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to\nconflict with it. And so there would be neither accord nor conflict\nhere.\u201d Wittgenstein\u2019s formulation of the problem, now at the\npoint of being a \u201cparadox\u201d, has given rise to a wealth of\ninterpretation and debate since it is clear to all that this is the\ncrux of the general issue of meaning, and of understanding and using a\nlanguage. One of the influential readings of the problem of following\na rule (introduced by Fogelin 1976 and Kripke 1982) has been the\ninterpretation, according to which Wittgenstein is here voicing a\nskeptical paradox and offering a skeptical solution. That is to say,\nthere are no facts that determine what counts as following a rule, no\nreal grounds for saying that someone is indeed following a rule, and\nWittgenstein accepts this skeptical challenge (by suggesting other\nconditions that might warrant our asserting that someone is following\na rule). This reading has been challenged, in turn, by several\ninterpretations (such as Baker and Hacker 1984, McGinn1984, and Cavell\n1990), while others have provided additional, fresh perspectives\n(e.g., Diamond, \u201cRules: Looking in the Right Place\u201d in\nPhillips and Winch 1989, and several in Miller and Wright 2002).</p>", "<p>\n\nDirectly following the rule-following sections in\n<em>PI</em>, and therefore easily thought to be the upshot of the\ndiscussion, are those sections called by interpreters \u201cthe\nprivate-language argument\u201d. Whether it be a veritable argument\nor not (and Wittgenstein never labeled it as such), these sections\npoint out that for an utterance to be meaningful it must be possible\nin principle to subject it to public standards and criteria of\ncorrectness. For this reason, a private-language, in which\n\u201cwords \u2026 are to refer to what only the speaker can\nknow\u2014to his immediate private sensations \u2026\u201d\n(<em>PI</em> 243), is not a genuine, meaningful, rule-governed\nlanguage. The signs in language can only function when there is a\npossibility of judging the correctness of their use, \u201cso the use\nof [a] word stands in need of a justification which everybody\nunderstands\u201d (<em>PI</em> 261).</p>", "<p>\n\nGrammar, usually taken to consist of the rules of correct syntactic\nand semantic usage, becomes, in Wittgenstein\u2019s hands, the\nwider\u2014and more elusive\u2014network of rules which determine\nwhat linguistic move is allowed as making sense, and what isn\u2019t. This\nnotion replaces the stricter and purer logic, which played such an\nessential role in the\n<em>Tractatus</em> in providing a scaffolding for language and the\nworld. Indeed, \u201c<em>Essence</em> is expressed in grammar\n\u2026 Grammar tells what kind of object anything is.  (Theology as\ngrammar)\u201d (<em>PI</em> 371, 373). The \u201crules\u201d of\ngrammar are not mere technical instructions from on-high for correct\nusage; rather, they express the norms for meaningful\nlanguage. Contrary to empirical statements, rules of grammar describe\nhow we use words in order to both justify and criticize our particular\nutterances. But as opposed to grammar-book rules, they are not\nidealized as an external system to be conformed to. Moreover, they are\nnot appealed to explicitly in any formulation, but are used in cases\nof philosophical perplexity to clarify where language misleads us into\nfalse illusions.  Thus, \u201cI can know what someone else is\nthinking, not what I am thinking. It is correct to say \u2018I know\nwhat you are thinking\u2019, and wrong to say \u2018I know what I am\nthinking.\u2019 (A whole cloud of philosophy condensed into a drop of\ngrammar.)\u201d (<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> 1953,\np.222).</p>", "<p>\n\nGrammar is not abstract, it is situated within the regular activity\nwith which language-games are interwoven: \u201c\u2026 the word\n\u2018language-<em>game</em>\u2019 is used here to emphasize the\nfact that the <em>speaking</em> of language is part of an activity, or\nof a form of life\u201d (<em>PI</em> 23). What enables language to\nfunction and therefore must be accepted as \u201cgiven\u201d are\nprecisely forms of life. In Wittgenstein\u2019s terms, \u201cIt is not\nonly agreement in definitions but also (odd as it may sound) in\njudgments that is required\u201d (<em>PI</em> 242), and this is\n\u201cagreement not in opinions, but rather in form of life\u201d\n(<em>PI</em> 241). Used by Wittgenstein sparingly\u2014five times in\nthe <em>Investigations</em>\u2014this concept has given rise to\ninterpretative quandaries and subsequent contradictory readings. Forms\nof life can be understood as changing and contingent, dependent on\nculture, context, history, etc; this appeal to forms of life grounds a\nrelativistic reading of Wittgenstein. On the other hand, it is the\nform of life common to humankind, \u201cshared human behavior\u201d\nwhich is \u201cthe system of reference by means of which we interpret\nan unknown language\u201d (<em>PI</em> 206). This might be seen as a\nuniversalistic turn, recognizing that the use of language is made\npossible by the human form of life.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn his later writings Wittgenstein holds, as he did in\nthe <em>Tractatus</em>, that philosophers do not\u2014or should\nnot\u2014supply a theory, neither do they provide\nexplanations. \u201cPhilosophy just puts everything before us, and\nneither explains nor deduces anything.\u2014Since everything lies\nopen to view there is nothing to explain\u201d (<em>PI</em> 126). The\nanti-theoretical stance is reminiscent of the early Wittgenstein, but\nthere are manifest differences. Although the <em>Tractatus</em>\nprecludes philosophical theories, it does construct a systematic\nedifice which results in the general form of the proposition, all the\nwhile relying on strict formal logic; the <em>Investigations</em>\npoints out the therapeutic non-dogmatic nature of philosophy, verily\ninstructing philosophers in the ways of therapy. \u201cThe work of\nthe philosopher consists in marshalling reminders for a particular\npurpose\u201d (<em>PI</em> 127).  Working with reminders and series\nof examples, different problems are solved. Unlike\nthe <em>Tractatus</em> which advanced one philosophical method, in\nthe <em>Investigations</em> \u201cthere is not a single philosophical\nmethod, though there are indeed methods, different therapies, as it\nwere\u201d (<em>PI</em> 133d). This is directly related to\nWittgenstein\u2019s eschewal of <em>the</em> logical form or of any\na-priori generalization that can be discovered or made in\nphilosophy. Trying to advance such general theses is a temptation\nwhich lures philosophers; but the real task of philosophy is both to\nmake us aware of the temptation and to show us how to overcome\nit. Consequently \u201ca philosophical problem has the form: \u2018I\ndon\u2019t know my way about.\u2019\u201d (<em>PI</em> 123), and hence\nthe aim of philosophy is \u201cto show the fly the way out of the\nfly-bottle\u201d (<em>PI</em> 309).</p>", "<p>\n\nThe style of the <em>Investigations</em> is strikingly different from\nthat of the <em>Tractatus</em>. Instead of strictly numbered sections\nwhich are organized hierarchically in programmatic order, the\n<em>Investigations</em> fragmentarily voices aphorisms about\nlanguage-games, family resemblance, forms of life, \u201csometimes\njumping, in a sudden change, from one area to another\u201d\n(<em>PI</em> Preface). This variation in style is of course essential\nand is \u201cconnected with the very nature of the\ninvestigation\u201d (<em>PI</em> Preface). As a matter of fact,\nWittgenstein was acutely aware of the contrast between the two stages\nof his thought, suggesting publication of both texts together in order\nto make the contrast obvious and clear.</p>", "<p>\n\nStill, it is precisely via the subject of the nature of philosophy\nthat the fundamental continuity between these two stages, rather than\nthe discrepancy between them, is to be found. In both cases philosophy\nserves, first, as critique of language. It is through analyzing\nlanguage\u2019s illusive power that the philosopher can expose the traps of\nmeaningless philosophical formulations. This means that what was\nformerly thought of as a philosophical problem may now dissolve \u201cand\nthis simply means that the philosophical problems should\n<em>completely</em> disappear\u201d (<em>PI</em> 133). Two implications of\nthis diagnosis, easily traced back in the <em>Tractatus</em>, are to\nbe recognized. One is the inherent dialogical character of philosophy,\nwhich is a responsive activity: difficulties and torments are\nencountered which are then to be dissipated by philosophical therapy.\nIn the <em>Tractatus</em>, this took the shape of advice: \u201cThe correct\nmethod in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing\nexcept what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science \u2026\nand then whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical,\nto demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain\nsigns in his propositions\u201d (<em>TLP</em> 6.53) The second, more far-\nreaching, \u201cdiscovery\u201d in the <em>Investigations</em> \u201cis the one that\nenables me to break off philosophizing when I want to\u201d\n(<em>PI</em> 133). This has been taken to revert back to the ladder\nmetaphor and the injunction to silence in the <em>Tractatus</em>.</p>", "<p>\n\nIt has been submitted that the writings of the period from 1946 until\nhis death (1951) constitute a distinctive phase of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nthought. These writings include, in addition to the second part of the\nfirst edition of the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, texts\nedited and collected in volumes such as <em>Remarks on\nColour</em>, <em>Remarks on the Philosophy of\nPsychology</em>, <em>Zettel</em>, <em>On Certainty</em>, and parts\nof <em>The Foundations of Mathematics</em>. Besides dealing with\nmathematics and psychology, this is the stage at which Wittgenstein\nmost seriously pursued questions traditionally recognized as\nepistemological. <em>On Certainty</em> tackles skeptical doubts and\nfoundational solutions but is, in typical Wittgensteinian fashion, a\nwork of therapy which discounts presuppositions common to both. This\nis intimately related to another of <em>On Certainty</em>\u2019s\nthemes\u2014the primacy of the deed to the word, or, in\nWittgenstein\u2019s <em>PI</em> terminology, of form of life to\ngrammar. The general tenor of all the writings of this last period can\nthence be viewed as, on the one hand, a move away from the critical\n(some would say destructive) positions of the\n<em>Investigations</em> to a more positive perspective on the same\nproblems that had been facing him since his early writings; on the\nother hand, this move does not constitute a break from the later\nperiod but is more properly viewed as its continuation, in a new\nlight.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "wittgenstein"]}

An elementary proposition is isomorphic to the\n<em>possible</em> state of affairs it is used to represent: it must\ncontain as many names as there are objects in the possible state of\naffairs. An elementary proposition is true <em>iff</em> its possible\nstate of affairs (i.e., its \u2018sense\u2019;\n\u2018<em>Sinn</em>\u2019) obtains.

On this\ninterpretation, the later Wittgenstein precludes undecidable\nmathematical propositions, but he allows that some <em>undecided</em>\nexpressions are propositions <em>of</em> a calculus because they are\ndecidable in principle (i.e., in the absence of a known, applicable\ndecision procedure).</p>", "<p>\nThere is considerable evidence, however, that the later Wittgenstein\nmaintains his intermediate position that an expression is a meaningful\nmathematical proposition only <em>within</em> a given calculus and\n<em>iff</em> we knowingly have in hand an applicable and effective\ndecision procedure by means of which we can decide it. For example,\nthough Wittgenstein vacillates between \u201cprovable in PM\u201d\nand \u201cproved in PM\u201d at (<em>RFM</em> App. III, \u00a76,\n\u00a78), he does so in order to use the former to consider the\nalleged conclusion of G\u00f6del\u2019s proof (i.e., that there exist\ntrue but unprovable mathematical propositions), which he then rebuts\nwith his own identification of \u201ctrue in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d with \u201c<em>proved</em> in calculus\n\\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d (i.e., <em>not</em> with \u201c<em>provable</em> in\ncalculus \\(\\Gamma\\)\u201d) (Wang 1991: 253; Rodych 1999a: 177). This\nconstrual is corroborated by numerous passages in which Wittgenstein\nrejects the received view that a prov<em>able</em> but unproved\nproposition is true, as he does when he asserts that (<em>RFM</em>\nIII, \u00a731, 1939) a proof \u201cmakes new connexions\u201d,\n\u201c[i]t does not establish that they are there\u201d because\n\u201cthey do not exist until it makes them\u201d, and when he says\n(<em>RFM</em> VII, \u00a710, 1941) that \u201c[a] new proof gives the\nproposition a place in a new system\u201d. Furthermore, as we have\njust seen, Wittgenstein rejects PIC as a non-proposition on the\ngrounds that it is not algorithmically decidable, while admitting\nfinitistic versions of PIC because they are algorithmically\ndecidable.</p>", "<p>\nPerhaps the most compelling evidence that the later Wittgenstein\nmaintains algorithmic decidability as his criterion for a mathematical\nproposition lies in the fact that, at (<em>RFM</em> V, \u00a79, 1942),\nhe says in two distinct ways that a mathematical\n\u2018question\u2019 can <em>become</em> decidable and that when\nthis <em>happens</em>, a new connexion is \u2018<em>made</em>\u2019\nwhich previously did not exist. Indeed, Wittgenstein cautions us\nagainst appearances by saying that \u201cit <em>looks</em> as if a\nground for the decision were already there\u201d, when, in fact,\n\u201cit has yet to be invented\u201d. These passages strongly\nmilitate against the claim that the later Wittgenstein grants that\nproposition \\(\\phi\\) is decidable in calculus \\(\\Gamma\\) iff it is\nprovable or refutable <em>in principle</em>. Moreover, if Wittgenstein\nheld <em>this</em> position, he would claim, contra (<em>RFM</em> V,\n\u00a79), that a question or proposition does not <em>become</em>\ndecidable since it simply (always) <em>is</em> decidable. If it is\nprovable, and we simply don\u2019t yet know this to be the case,\nthere <em>already is</em> a connection between, say, our axioms and\nrules and the proposition in question. What Wittgenstein says,\nhowever, is that the modalities <em>provable</em> and\n<em>refutable</em> are shadowy forms of reality\u2014that possibility\nis not actuality in mathematics (<em>PR</em> \u00a7\u00a7141, 144,\n172; <em>PG</em> 281, 283, 299, 371, 466, 469; <em>LFM</em> 139).\nThus, the later Wittgenstein agrees with the intermediate Wittgenstein\nthat the only sense in which an <em>undecided</em> mathematical\nproposition (<em>RFM</em> VII, \u00a740, 1944) can be\n<em>decidable</em> is in the sense that we <em>know</em> how to decide\nit by means of an applicable decision procedure.</p>", "<p>\nLargely a product of his <em>anti-foundationalism</em> and his\ncriticism of the extension-intension conflation, Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlater critique of set theory is highly consonant with his intermediate\ncritique (<em>PR</em> \u00a7\u00a7109, 168; <em>PG</em> 334, 369, 469;\n<em>LFM</em> 172, 224, 229; and <em>RFM</em> III, \u00a743, 46, 85,\n90; VII, \u00a716). Given that mathematics is a \u201cMOTLEY of\ntechniques of proof\u201d (<em>RFM</em> III, \u00a746), it does not\nrequire a foundation (<em>RFM</em> VII, \u00a716) and it cannot be\ngiven a <em>self-evident</em> foundation (<em>PR</em> \u00a7160;\n<em>WVC</em> 34 &amp; 62; <em>RFM</em> IV, \u00a73). Since set theory\nwas invented to provide mathematics with a foundation, it is,\nminimally, unnecessary.</p>", "<p>\nEven if set theory is unnecessary, it still might constitute a solid\nfoundation for mathematics. In his core criticism of set theory,\nhowever, the later Wittgenstein denies this, saying that the diagonal\nproof does not prove non-denumerability, for \u201c[i]t means nothing\nto say: \u2018<em>Therefore</em> the X numbers are not\ndenumerable\u2019\u201d (<em>RFM</em> II, \u00a710). When the diagonal is\nconstrued as a <em>proof</em> of greater and lesser infinite sets it\nis a \u201cpuffed-up proof\u201d, which, as Poincar\u00e9 argued\n(1913: 61\u201362), purports to prove or show more than \u201cits\nmeans allow it\u201d (<em>RFM</em> II, \u00a721).</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nIf it were said: Consideration of the diagonal procedure shews you that the\n<em>concept</em> \u2018real number\u2019 has much less analogy with\nthe concept \u2018cardinal number\u2019 than we, being misled by\ncertain analogies, are inclined to believe, that would have a good and honest sense.

On the reading of these four early\nexpert reviewers, Wittgenstein failed to understand G\u00f6del\u2019s\nTheorem because he failed to understand the mechanics of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof and he erroneously thought he could refute or\nundermine G\u00f6del\u2019s proof simply by identifying \u201ctrue\nin <em>PM</em>\u201d (i.e., <em>Principia Mathematica</em>) with\n\u201cproved/provable in <em>PM</em>\u201d.</p>", "<p>\nInterestingly, we now have two pieces of evidence (Kreisel 1998: 119;\nRodych 2003: 282, 307) that Wittgenstein wrote (<em>RFM</em> App. III)\nin 1937\u201338 after reading <em>only</em> the informal,\n\u2018casual\u2019 (MS 126, 126\u2013127; Dec. 13, 1942)\nintroduction of (G\u00f6del 1931) and that, therefore, his use of a\nself-referential proposition as the \u201ctrue but unprovable\nproposition\u201d may be based on G\u00f6del\u2019s introductory,\ninformal statements, namely that \u201cthe undecidable proposition\n[\\(R(q);q\\)] states\u2026 that [\\(R(q);q\\)] is not provable\u201d\n(1931: 598) and that \u201c[\\(R(q);q\\)] says about itself that it is\nnot provable\u201d (1931: 599).

To address this question, he asks \u201cWhat is\ncalled a true proposition in Russell\u2019s system\u2026?\u201d,\nwhich he succinctly answers (\u00a76): \u201c\u2018<i>p</i>\u2019\n<em>is true = p</em>\u201d.

This, in a nutshell, is\nWittgenstein\u2019s conception of \u201cmathematical truth\u201d: a\ntrue proposition of <em>PM</em> is an axiom or a proved proposition,\nwhich means that \u201ctrue in <em>PM</em>\u201d is identical with,\nand therefore can be supplanted by, \u201cproved in\n<em>PM</em>\u201d.</p>", "<p>\nHaving explicated, to his satisfaction at least, the only real,\nnon-illusory notion of \u201ctrue in <em>PM</em>\u201d, Wittgenstein\nanswers the (\u00a78) question \u201cMust I not say that this\nproposition\u2026 is true, and\u2026 unprovable?\u201d\n<em>negatively</em> by (re)stating his own (\u00a7\u00a75\u20136)\nconception of \u201ctrue in <em>PM</em>\u201d as\n\u201cproved/provable in <em>PM</em>\u201d: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\u2018True in Russell\u2019s system\u2019 means, as was said:\nproved in Russell\u2019s system; and \u2018false in Russell\u2019s\nsystem\u2019 means: the opposite has been proved in Russell\u2019s\nsystem. </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThis answer is given in a slightly different way at (\u00a77) where\nWittgenstein asks \u201cmay there not be true propositions which are\nwritten in this [Russell\u2019s] symbolism, but are not provable in\nRussell\u2019s system?\u201d, and then answers \u201c\u2018True\npropositions\u2019, hence propositions which are true in\n<em>another</em> system, i.e. can rightly be asserted in another\ngame\u201d. In light of what he says in (\u00a7\u00a75, 6, and 8),\nWittgenstein\u2019s (\u00a77) point is that if a proposition is\n\u2018written\u2019 in \u201cRussell\u2019s symbolism\u201d and\nit is true, <em>it must be proved/provable in another system</em>,\nsince that is what \u201cmathematical truth\u201d is.

Moreover, there\nseem to be no compelling non-semantical reasons\u2014either\nintra-systemic or extra-mathematical\u2014for Wittgenstein to\naccommodate <i>P</i> by including it in <em>PM</em> or by adopting a\nnon-syntactical conception of mathematical truth (such as Tarski-truth\n(Steiner 2000)). Indeed, Wittgenstein questions the intra-systemic and\nextra-mathematical <em>usability</em> of <i>P</i> in various discussions\nof G\u00f6del in the <em>Nachlass</em> and, at\n(\u00a719), he emphatically says that one cannot \u201cmake the truth\nof the assertion [\u2018<i>P</i>\u2019 or \u2018Therefore\n<i>P</i>\u2019] plausible to me, since you can make no use of it except\nto do these bits of legerdemain\u201d.</p>", "<p>\nAfter the initial, scathing reviews of <em>RFM</em>, very little\nattention was paid to Wittgenstein\u2019s (<em>RFM</em> App. III and\n<em>RFM</em> VII, \u00a7\u00a721\u201322) discussions of\nG\u00f6del\u2019s First Incompleteness Theorem (Klenk 1976: 13) until\nShanker\u2019s sympathetic (1988b).

B. Yeats). In 1892 he\nwent to Trinity College Cambridge to study Classics. He soon made the\nacquaintance there of Bertrand Russell who was two years ahead of him\nand of J. M. E. McTaggart who was then a charismatic young Philosophy\nFellow of Trinity College. Under their encouragement Moore decided to\nadd the study of Philosophy to his study of Classics, and he graduated\nin 1896 with a First Class degree in the subject. At this point he\nturned his energies towards attempting to follow in the footsteps of\nMcTaggart and Russell by winning a \u2018Prize\u2019 Fellowship at\nTrinity College which would enable him to continue the study of\nphilosophy there. In 1898 he was successful and over the next six years\nhe matured as a dynamic young philosopher, actually leading Russell\naway from the idealist philosophy of McTaggart and others which was\nthen dominant in Britain.</p>", "<p>\n\nMoore's Fellowship ended in 1904; after a spell away from Cambridge,\nMoore returned there in 1911 to a lectureship in the University and he\nthen lived there for the rest of his life (apart from an extended visit\nto the U.S.A. in 1940-44). In 1921 he became editor of <em>Mind</em>,\nthe leading British philosophical journal, and in 1925 he became a\nProfessor at Cambridge. These two appointments confirmed his position\nas the most highly respected British philosopher of the time, and with\nWittgenstein back in Cambridge after 1929, Cambridge became the most\nimportant centre of philosophy in the world. Moore retired as Professor\nin 1939 (to be succeeded by Wittgenstein) and as editor of\n<em>Mind</em> in 1944; these retirements marked not only the end of his\npre-eminence, but also of the golden age of Cambridge philosophy.</p>", "<p>\n\nEarly in his time in Cambridge Moore became friends with some of the\nyoung men who went on to form the \u2018Bloomsbury Group\u2019, such\nas Lytton Strachey, Leonard Woolf and Maynard Keynes. Through these\nfriendships Moore exerted an indirect influence on British\ntwentieth-century culture as profound as that of any more\n\u2018engaged\u2019 philosopher. These long-lasting friendships bear\nwitness to Moore's Socratic personality and thus to a side of his\ncharacter which his writings do not convey. Gilbert Ryle, the Oxford\nphilosopher who was Moore's successor both as editor of <em>Mind</em>\nand as the dominant British philosopher after 1945, emphasized this\nside of Moore's personality:</p>", "<blockquote>He gave us courage not by making concessions, but by making\nno concessions to our youth or our shyness. He treated us as corrigible\nand therefore as responsible thinkers. He would explode at our mistakes\nand muddles with just that genial ferocity with which he would explode\nat the mistakes and muddles of philosophical high-ups, and with just\nthe genial ferocity with which he would explode at mistakes and muddles\nof his own. (Ryle 270)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nMoore was first drawn to philosophy through contact with McTaggart\nand under McTaggart's influence he fell briefly under the spell of\nBritish idealism, especially the work of F. H. Bradley. Thus when in\n1897 he made his first attempt to win a Prize Fellowship at Trinity he\nsubmitted a dissertation on \u2018The Metaphysical Basis of\nEthics\u2019 in which he acknowledges his indebtedness to Bradley and\npresents an idealist ethical theory. One element of this theory is what\nhe calls \u2018the fallacy involved in all empirical definitions of\nthe good\u2019, which is immediately recognisable as a precursor of\nhis famous claim in <em>Principia Ethica</em> that there is a fallacy,\nthe \u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019, in all naturalistic definitions\nof goodness. This point indicates that although, as we shall see below,\nMoore quickly came to reject the idealist philosophy of Bradley and\nMcTaggart, he held that their criticisms of empiricism, as represented\nby J. S. Mill's philosophy, were sound and he carried this hostility to\nempiricism forward into his mature philosophy. In this respect,\ntherefore, his early idealist enthusiasm had an enduring impact on his\nthought.</p>", "<p>\n\nA substantial part of this early dissertation is devoted to a\ncritical discussion of Kant's moral philosophy, and it is striking that\nalthough in his general approach and conclusions Moore endorses the\nkind of idealism advanced by Bradley, he is already critical of Kant's\nconception of practical reason. He argues that Kant's use of this\nconception blurs the distinction between \u2018the psychological\nfaculty of making judgments and inferences\u2019 and that which is\n\u2018true and objective\u2019. This distinction, Moore maintains,\n\u2018cannot be either done away or bridged over\u2019. Hence, he\nargues, Kant's conception of morality as founded on <em>a priori</em>\nprinciples of practical reason is untenable. It is easy to see how this\nline of thought could be extended to a general criticism of Kant's\nconception of the <em>a priori</em>; and it is precisely this\ngeneralisation that Moore undertakes in his successful 1898\ndissertation. At the same time he comes to see that his previous\nenthusiasm for Bradley's idealism was not well founded (though it still\ntakes him a little time to accept that the arguments of Bradley and\nMcTaggart against the reality of time are flawed). So it is in this\n1898 dissertation that Moore turns decisively against idealist\nphilosophy, both in its Kantian and Bradleian forms.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere are several aspects to this. As I have indicated, he rejects\nKant's conception of the <em>a priori</em> as a muddled form of\nsubjectivism or psychologism. The following passage from <em>Principia\nEthica</em> (1903) is indicative of his polemic which can be found in\nmany of his writings of this period:</p>", "<blockquote>That \u2018to be true\u2019 <em>means</em>\u00a0 to be\nthought in a certain way is, therefore, certainly false. Yet this\nassertion plays the most central part in Kant's \u2018Copernical\nRevolution\u2019 of philosophy, and renders worthless the whole mass\nof modern literature, to which that revolution has given rise, and\nwhich is called Epistemology. (<em>Principia Ethica</em>\n183)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThe distinction Moore is drawing on here between thought on the one\nhand and what is objective or real on the other is one that runs\nthrough his critique of idealism. An important early context in which\nhe elaborates it is his discussion of meaning in his famous paper\n\u2018The Nature of Judgement\u2019 (1899), which comes largely from\nhis 1898 Dissertation. Moore begins here by attributing to Bradley a\nquasi-empiricist view of meaning as abstracted from the total content\nof judgement. This is a mistake, but what is important is what follows:\nas against this view Moore holds that meanings, which he calls\n\u2018concepts\u2019, are entirely non-psychological. They come\ntogether in propositions, which are the \u2018objects\u2019 of\nthoughts and, as such, are to be sharply distinguished from any mental\ncontents or representations. Indeed true propositions do not represent\nor correspond to a fact or real state of affairs; instead they just are\nfacts. He put this point very clearly in a short entry written a year\nlater on \u2018Truth\u2019:</p>", "<blockquote>it seems plain that a truth differs in no respect from the\nreality to which it was supposed merely to correspond: e.g. the truth\nthat I exist differs in no respect from the corresponding reality\n\u2014 my existence. So far, indeed, from truth being defined by\nreference to reality, reality can only be defined by reference to\ntruth. (\u2018Truth\u2019 21)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nAs Moore came to see ten years later, this radical metaphysics of\ntrue propositions is too simple. But in the present context what is\nstriking about it is the way in which by itself it hovers between\nidealism and realism. If propositions are thought of as contents of\njudgment, then to hold that reality just comprises true propositions is\nto take an idealist stance. What makes the position realist in Moore's\nhands is his uncompromising realism concerning propositions and\nconcepts: although they are possible objects of thought, Moore writes,\n\u2018that is no definition of them\u2019; for \u2018it is\nindifferent to their nature whether anybody thinks them or not\u2019\n(\u2018The Nature of Judgment\u2019 4)</p>", "<p>\n\nMoore's most famous criticisms of idealism are contained in his\npaper \u2018The Refutation of Idealism\u2019 (1903). The basic theme\nof this paper is the extension to sense-experience of the strong\ndistinction between the mind and its objects which we have encountered\nin connection with meaning. Moore concentrates here on the case of a\n\u2018sensation of blue\u2019 and maintains that this experience is a\nkind of \u2018diaphanous\u2019 consciousness or awareness of blue,\nwhich is not a \u2018content\u2019 of experience at all, but\nsomething real whose existence is not dependent on experience. His\nargument here is in part phenomenological: \u2018when we try to\nintrospect the sensation of blue, all we can see is the blue\u2019\n(41); but he also argues that to suppose otherwise, that the\n\u2018blue\u2019 is merely a content of the experience is to suppose\nthat it is a quality of the experience, so that the experience is blue\nin much the way in which a blue bead is blue, which he takes to be\nabsurd. Not surprisingly Moore's critics were not happy with this\ncomparison, but it was not until the formulation of the\n\u2018adverbial\u2019 theory of experience by Ducasse in the 1940's,\naccording to which someone who has a sensation of blue is someone who\n\u2018senses bluely\u2019, that there was a reasonably robust\nresponse to Moore's criticism. What is, nonetheless, odd about Moore's\npaper is that he makes no attempt to address the famous \u2018argument\nfrom illusion\u2019. Moore concludes that \u2018\u201cblue\u201d is\nas much an object, and as little a mere content, of my experience, when\nI experience it, as the most exalted and independent real thing of\nwhich I am ever aware\u2019 (42). As he was soon to realise, more\nneeds to be said to handle cases in which something which is not in\nfact blue looks blue.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe final aspect of Moore's critical response to idealism concerns\nhis rejection of the monism which was characteristic of British\nidealism. This is the holistic thesis that ordinary things are\nessentially inter-related in such an intimate way that they constitute\ntogether an \u2018organic unity\u2019 which is, in a sense, the only\nthing that \u2018really\u2019 exists, since it is the only thing\nwhose existence is not dependent on the existence of anything else.\nThis thesis is especially characteristic of Bradley's idealism,\naccording to which the Absolute is the one real thing. In his early\nwritings and in <em>Principia Ethica</em> Moore engages in a good deal\nof polemical criticism of this thesis, but it is hard to find any\narguments against it, as opposed to a robust affirmation of a realist\npluralism. Rather later, however, in his paper \u2018External and\nInternal Relations\u2019 (written in 1919) Moore focused on the\nidealist conception of internal relations which lies at the heart of\nthe monist thesis. Moore's argument against the thesis that all\nrelations are internal starts from the claim that the burden of proof\nlies on its supporters since it conflicts with our common sense\nconviction that things are not essentially inter-related in such a way\nthat a change to one thing in one respect necessitates changes to\neverything else. Moore then argues that the best reason one could have\nfor the thesis involves a logical fallacy; he shows how the thesis that\nall relations are internal might be plausibly, but fallaciously,\ninferred from Leibniz\u2019 Law, the uncontentious principle that things\nwhich differ in their relations must differ in their identity.\nSimplifying a bit, and using Moore's concept of entailment (see below),\nhis argument runs as follows:</p>", "<ol>\n<li>Leibniz\u2019 Law states that \n\n<blockquote><em>xRy</em> entails (<em>z = x</em> \u2192\n<em>zRy</em>),</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\nwhere \u2018\u2192\u2019 is the truth-functional conditional</p></li>\n\n<li>Since entailment is a necessary connection, one might infer \n\n<blockquote><em>xRy</em> \u2192 Necessarily (<em>z = x</em> \u2192\n<em>zRy</em>)</blockquote>\n</li>\n\n<li>From (2) one can immediately infer \n\n<blockquote><em>xRy</em> \u2192 Necessarily (<em>x = x</em> \u2192\n<em>xRy</em>)</blockquote>\n</li>\n\n<li>Since <em>x = x</em> is itself a necessary truth, one can now infer\n\n<blockquote><em>xRy</em> \u2192 Necessarily (<em>xRy</em>)</blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\nwhich expresses the thesis that all relations are internal.</p></li>\n</ol>", "<p>\n\nSo, on the face of it, this thesis has here been inferred from\nLeibniz\u2019 Law. Moore observes, however, that the step from (1) to (2) is\ninvalid; it confuses the necessity of a connection with the necessity\nof the consequent. In ordinary language this distinction is not clearly\nmarked, although it is easy to draw it with a suitable formal\nlanguage.</p>", "<p>\n\nMoore's argument here is a sophisticated piece of informal modal\nlogic; but whether it really gets to the heart of the motivation for\nBradley's Absolute idealism can be doubted. My own view is that\nBradley's dialectic rests on a different thesis about the inadequacy of\nthought as a representation of reality, and thus that one has to dig\nrather deeper into Bradley's idealist metaphysics both to extract the\ngrounds for his monism and to exhibit what is wrong with it.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe main achievement of Moore's early period is his book\n<em>Principia Ethica</em>. It was published in 1903 but was the\nculmination of the reflections which Moore commenced in his 1897\ndissertation on \u2018The Metaphysical basis of Ethics\u2019. The\nmain impetus, however, came from a series of lectures in London on\n\u2018The Elements of Ethics\u2019 which Moore gave late in 1898.\nMoore had the text of these lectures typed up with a view to publishing\nthem; but as his thoughts progressed he reworked his text and\n<em>Principia Ethica</em> is the result of this reworking (the lectures\nhave recently been published as <em>The Elements of Ethics</em>). Most\nof the first three chapters come from the 1898 lectures; whereas the\nlast three chapters are largely new material.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn the first three chapters Moore sets out his criticisms of\n\u2018ethical naturalism\u2019. At the core of these criticisms is\nthe thesis that the position involves a fallacy, the\n\u2018naturalistic fallacy\u2019, of supposing that goodness, which\nMoore takes to be the fundamental ethical value, can be defined in\nnaturalistic terms, in terms, say, of pleasure or desire or the course\nof evolution. As against all such claims Moore insists that goodness is\nindefinable, or unanalysable, and thus that ethics is an autonomous\nscience, irreducible to natural science or, indeed, to metaphysics.\nMoore's main argument against the possibility of any such definition of\ngoodness is that when we confront a putative definition, such as that\nto be good is to be something which we desire to desire, we can tell\nthat this is not a claim that is true by definition because its truth\nremains for us an \u2018open question\u2019 in the sense that it\nremains sensible to doubt it in a way which would not be possible if it\nwere just a definition which makes explicit our understanding of the\nwords. The merits of this argument are questionable; in many cases we\ncan sensibly doubt the truth of a definition, especially where the\ndefinition makes use of discoveries that have not been part of our\nordinary understanding, as is normally the case with definitions in the\nnatural sciences. But there is, I think, a way of modifying Moore's\nargument which takes it around this objection, namely by taking it to\nrest on the epistemological thesis that ethical questions cannot be\nanswered without the explicit involvement of ethical beliefs. The\nreason that this thesis is inimical to naturalistic definitions of\nethical values is that an important role of definitions in the natural\nsciences and elsewhere is that they enable one to answer questions in\nnew ways that would not otherwise be possible: it is thanks to the\ndefinition of water as H<sub>2</sub>O, and not in terms of its familiar\nphenotype, that we can be confident that some comets are mainly\ncomposed of water. But there is no way in which we would accept that\nthe answer to a novel ethical question, for example concerning the\nacceptability of the use of human embryos for stem cell research, is to\nbe found by finding a definition of ethical values which enables us to\nanswer this question without drawing on beliefs that are expressed with\nthe familiar ethical \u2018phenotype\u2019, i.e., explicitly ethical\nconcepts.</p>", "<p>\n\nThis defence of Moore's argument does not address a different\nconcern, namely that the argument applies only to versions of ethical\nnaturalism which involve a definition of ethical value, and thus that\nnaturalist positions which maintain that ethical value is an\nirreducible natural property are not touched by the argument. Moore's\nargument against positions of this kind rests on the claim that the\nethical value of a situation is not a feature of it which is\nindependent of its other properties; on the contrary it depends on its\nother properties. As he puts it in the preface he composed for the\nsecond edition of <em>Principia Ethica</em>, but never actually\npublished, a thing's \u2018intrinsic value\u2019 depends on its\n\u2018intrinsic nature\u2019, and he glosses this dependence in terms\nof the relationship which we now call \u2018supervenience\u2019\n(though Moore does not use the term): things with the same intrinsic\nnature, or natural properties, must have the same intrinsic value (see\n\u2018The Conception of Intrinsic Value\u2019 286). Moore took it\nthat supervenience was not an inherently reductive relationship, and\nthus that it was consistent for him to hold that goodness is not a\nnatural property even though it supervenes upon natural properties;\nbut, he assumed, if one takes the view that goodness is itself a\nnatural property, the fact that it supervenes upon other natural\nproperties makes it impossible to avoid a reductive thesis. So the\nsupervenience of intrinsic value removes the option of a non-reductive\nnaturalism without contradicting his version of ethical\nnon-naturalism.</p>", "<p>\n\nSubsequent discussion has shown that the relationship between\nsupervenience and reduction is a complicated matter, and though I think\nthat Moore's position is defensible this is not the place to take the\nissue further. Instead I want to turn to the concept of intrinsic value\nwhich is central to Moore's theory. One aspect of this is easy, namely\nthe distinction between the \u2018intrinsic\u2019 value of a\nsituation and its \u2018instrumental\u2019 value: this is the\ndistinction between the value inherent in a situation and that which\ndepends only on the situation's consequences. Despite this distinction\nit remains the case that intrinsic value is the fundamental type of\nethical value, since instrumental value is definable in terms of the\nintrinsic value of a situation's consequences. But intrinsic value is\nnot merely non-instrumental value; for it is also to be distinguished\nfrom what Moore calls the \u2018value as a part\u2019 of a situation,\nnamely the extra contribution which the situation makes to the value of\na complex situation of which it is a \u2018part\u2019, over and above\nits intrinsic value. This is not a conception which is familiar to us,\nbut Moore illustrates the point by the following case: although\nknowledge has little intrinsic value, the value of the aesthetic\nappreciation of a beautiful work of art (which is, according to Moore,\npotentially one of the most valuable things there is) is greatly\nenhanced by knowledge about it. So this kind of knowledge can have a\nsubstantial \u2018value as a part\u2019 even though it has little\nintrinsic value. As before intrinsic value remains the fundamental\nconception of value, since a situation's value as a part is defined in\nterms of the overall intrinsic value of a complex situation to which it\nmakes a contribution beyond its own intrinsic value. Nonetheless this\npoint implies that a thing's intrinsic value is not simply its value\nirrespective of its consequences; it is also its value irrespective of\nits context. Hence the concept of intrinsic value is to be such that a\ntype of situation has the same intrinsic value in all contexts \u2014\nwhich is why Moore holds that its intrinsic value depends only on its\n\u2018intrinsic nature\u2019.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere are two connected problems here: the first concerns the way in\nwhich something's \u2018value as a part\u2019 depends on accepting\nthat when it occurs as an element of a complex situation it may affect\nthe latter's value in a way which is not simply the result of taking\nits intrinsic value into account. This judgement is enshrined by Moore\nin his \u2018principle of organic unities\u2019, which declares that\nthis kind of non-aggregative valuation of complex situations is liable\nto occur. The problem here is not that Moore's principle is incorrect,\nbut rather that it seems irrational since it puts a block on moral\nreasoning. The second problem concerns the thesis that intrinsic value\nis the same in all contexts. For this just seems wrong, in that the\nvalue of, say, friendship differs from one context to another.\nAlthough, as Moore rightly says, friendship is normally one of the most\nvaluable things there is, it has no value at all where claims of\njustice are at stake, as in a court of law. So Moore's conception of\nabsolutely universal intrinsic values should be replaced by a\nconception which allows for the \u2018bracketing\u2019 of normal\nvalues in certain contexts; and once this is in place, along with a\nmore sophisticated account of normative values than Moore provides, it\nis reasonable to hope that the phenomena captured by Moore's irrational\nprinciple of organic unities will find a more comprehensible\ninterpretation.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnother area where Moore's ethical theory is problematic is his\naccount of ethical knowledge. Because of his hostility to ethical\nnaturalism Moore denies that ethical knowledge is a matter of empirical\nenquiry. But, as we have seen, he is equally hostile to Kant's\nrationalist thesis that fundamental ethical truths are truths of\nreason. Instead he holds that ethical knowledge rests on a capacity for\nan intuitive grasp of fundamental ethical truths for which we can give\nno reason since there is no reason to be given. The trouble with this\nis that if we can say nothing to support a claim to such knowledge,\nthose who disagree with it can only register their disagreement and\npass on; hence ethical debate is liable to turn into the expression of\nconflicting judgements which admit of no resolution. In the light of\nthis, it is not surprising that Moore's ethical theory was regarded as\nundermining the cognitive status of morality, and thus that it led\ndirectly to the development of ethical non-cognitivism by those who\nwere influenced by Moore, such as A. J. Ayer and C. L. Stevenson. Yet\nthere was another side to Moore's discussion of ethical issues, in\nwhich he found himself arguing against the hedonist thesis that\npleasure is the only thing with positive intrinsic value, despite the\nfact that officially he held that no such arguments could be given.\nWhen engaged in this kind of \u2018indirect\u2019 method of argument,\nMoore sees himself as seeking to obtain agreement rather than to\nestablish the truth, though he also acknowledges that from a\nfirst-person point of view there is little difference here. Because\nthis indirect method is not integrated into his official method of\nethical inquiry, he says little about its presuppositions. But it seems\nto me that one can find here the beginnings of a \u2018common\nsense\u2019 approach to ethics which is distinctly preferable to his\nofficial appeal to intuitive judgments concerning the relative\nintrinsic value of situations of arbitrary complexity.</p>", "<p>\n\nSo far I have discussed Moore's \u2018metaethics\u2019, his views\nabout the metaphysics of ethical value and the nature of ethical\nknowledge. This emphasis reflects the fact that this aspect of Moore's\nethical theory has been most influential; but it is also worth\nmentioning briefly some points from his moral theory. Moore presents a\nstraightforward consequentialist account of the relationship between\nthe right and the good: the right action is that which will produce the\nbest outcome. In practice, because it is so difficult for us to\ndetermine by ourselves what is the best outcome, he allows that we\nprobably do best if we follow established rules; thus Moore ends up\nrecommending a conservative form of rule consequentialism, for which he\nwas criticised by Keynes and Russell. Later critics such as W. D. Ross\nargued that because Moore subjects our personal responsibilities to the\nimpersonal test of producing the best outcome his position does not\nadequately capture the way in which they arise from our relationships\nwith particular people; as recent critics put it, Moore's moral theory\nis resolutely \u2018agent-neutral\u2019 and for that reason\ninadequate as an account of the personal responsibilities which involve\nirreducibly \u2018agent-relative\u2019 values.</p>", "<p>\n\nFinally, in the last chapter of <em>Principia Ethica</em>,Moore sets\nout his \u2018ideal\u2019 \u2014 a deliberately unsystematic list of\nintrinsic goods (such as friendship and the appreciation of beauty) and\nintrinsic evils (such as consciousness of pain). Moore's choice of\nvalues is striking: it connects with the \u2018Bloomsbury\u2019 ideal\nof life devoted to Art and Love, and excludes social values such as\nequality and freedom. The individualism of the resulting morality is\nenhanced by the fact that Moore maintains that these intrinsic values\nare incommensurable, and thus that the assessment of priorities among\nthem is inescapably a matter of individual judgment. As Keynes put it,\nMoore's ideal was a kind of secular \u2018religion\u2019 - not much\nuse for public policy but fine for talented individuals who could agree\nto differ in their detailed value judgments.</p>", "<p>\n\nBy the time Moore returned to Cambridge in 1911 to a lectureship\nthere, Russell\u00a0 and Whitehead were finishing off their massive\nproject of exhibiting the logical foundations of mathematics \u2014\n<em>Principia Mathematica</em>. Although Moore was neither a\nmathematician nor a logical theorist he was one of the first people to\ngrasp that Russell's new logical theory was an essential tool for\nphilosophy and offered important new insights. One example of this\nconcerns the status of propositions, the \u2018objects\u2019 of\nthought. As we saw above, in his early work Moore had been emphatic\nthat propositions are altogether independent of thought and had even\nproposed that facts are just true propositions. But as he came to think\nmore about falsehood in his lectures <em>Some Main Problems of\nPhilosophy</em> of 1910\u201311, it became clear to him that this\nposition was a mistake, since the truth of a proposition should not\naffect its\u00a0 ontological status and yet it would be absurd to give\nfalse propositions the status of facts. So he now rejected the view\nthat facts are just true propositions. On his new view, facts are, as\nbefore, constituted by objects and their properties; but what about\npropositions? According to Moore, philosophers talk legitimately of\npropositions in order to identify the aspects of thought and language\nwhich are crucial to questions of truth and inference, and in doing so\nit may appear that they regard propositions as genuine entities. But,\nMoore now holds, this implication is unwarranted: the mistake here is\none of supposing that \u2018every expression which seems to be a name\nof something must be so in fact\u2019 (<em>Some Main Problems of\nPhilosophy</em>, 266). Moore does not allude here explicitly to\nRussell's theory of incomplete symbols and logical fictions, but it is\nclear that this is the kind of position he has in mind. The new logic\nenables one to preserve realist appearances without accepting realist\nmetaphysics.</p>", "<p>\n\nYet Moore was not an uncritical follower of Russell. He was critical\nof Russell's account of implication in which Russell proposes that the\ntruth-functional conditional expresses all there is to the logical\nrelationship of implication between propositions, and introduced\ninstead the term \u2018entailment\u2019 for this latter relationship\n(\u2018External and Internal Relations\u2019 90ff.). While\nrecognising that entailment is closely connected to logical necessity\nhe came to think that entailment is not just a matter of the necessity\nof the truth-functional conditional, thereby setting off a debate about\nthis relationship which continues to this day. Again, Moore was\ncritical of Russell's treatment of existence, in particular his denial\nthat it makes sense to treat existence as a first-order predicate of\nparticular objects (for Russell, existence has to be expressed by the\nexistential quantifier and is therefore a second-order predicate of\npredicates). While agreeing with Russell that existence is not a\nstraightforward first-order predicate (so that the logical form of\n\u2018Tame tigers exist\u2019 is not the same as that of \u2018Tame\ntigers growl\u2019), Moore argued that statements such as \u2018This\nmight not exist\u2019 make perfectly good sense and that they could\nnot do so unless the simpler statement \u2018This exists\u2019 also\nmakes sense (\u2018Is Existence a Predicate?\u2019 145).</p>", "<p>\n\nMoore's uses of Russell's logic take place in the broader context of\nhis use of analysis as a method of philosophy. Although Moore always\ndenied that philosophy is just analysis, there is no denying that it\nplays a central role in his philosophy and it is therefore important to\ndetermine what motivates this role. This question is especially\npressing in Moore's case because he rejected the main analytical\nprogrammes of twentieth century philosophy \u2014 both Wittgenstein's\nlogical atomism and the logical empiricism of the members of the Vienna\ncircle and their followers such as A. J. Ayer. In the first case, Moore\nrejected Wittgenstein's thesis that whatever exists exists necessarily;\nas with the idealist thesis that all relations are internal, Moore held\nthat our common sense conviction that some of the things which exist\nmight not have done so creates a strong presumption against any\nphilosopher who maintains the opposite, and that the logical atomist\nposition does not provide convincing reasons why this presumption\nshould be overturned. In addition Moore held that it is just not true\nthat all necessity is logical necessity, as Wittgenstein maintained; in\nhis early writings, despite his hostility to Kant, he had explicitly\ndefended the conception of necessary synthetic truths and he did not\nchange his mind on this point. This point also provides a reason for\nhis rejection of logical empiricism, since this position famously\nincludes the thesis that all necessary truths are\n\u2018analytic\u2019. But Moore also recognised that his early\ncriticisms of William James' pragmatism can be applied to the logical\nempiricist position. In connection with James, Moore had observed that\nwhere a proposition concerns the past, it may well be that we are in a\nsituation in which a proposition and its negation are both unverifiable\nbecause there is now no evidence either way on the matter. But, he\nargued, it does not follow that we cannot now affirm that either the\nproposition or its negation is true, thanks to the Law of Excluded\nMiddle; in which case it cannot be that truth is verifiability \u2014\ncontrary both to James' pragmatism and to logical empiricism.</p>", "<p>\n\nYet why then did Moore think that the analysis of propositions was\nso important? In part his motivation derives from his acceptance of a\nprinciple which Russell had introduced \u2014 that \u2018every\nproposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of\nconstituents with which we are acquainted\u2019 (Russell 91). For this\nprinciple motivates the \u2018sense-datum analysis\u2019 of\nperception to which he devoted so much attention and which I shall\ndiscuss in a moment. In addition, when explaining the importance of\nphilosophical analysis, he emphasized the importance of getting clear\nwhat is at issue in some debate; but an issue which he himself was not\nclear about was that of the implications of an analysis. In his early\nwritings he took the view that in so far as the analysis of a\nproposition clarifies it, it also clarifies its ontological\nimplications; thus he then held it to be an objection to a\nphenomenalist analysis of propositions about material objects that the\nanalysis calls into question the existence of such objects. But he\nlater took the opposite point of view, maintaining that a phenomenalist\nanalysis just provides an account of what their existence amounts to.\nIn between these two positions, in his 1925 paper \u2018A Defence of\nCommon Sense\u2019 (which I discuss further below), Moore had held\nthat what the sense-datum analysis of perception shows is that\nsense-data are the \u2018principal or ultimate subject&lt;s&gt;\u2019\n(128) of propositions about perception. This remark, I think, reflects\nthe true importance of philosophical analysis for Moore: its importance\nfor him is metaphysical in so far as it reveals the\n\u2018ultimate\u2019 substances which are the subjects of our\nordinary common sense thought and talk.</p>", "<p>\n\nIt did not take Moore long to realise that the realist position he\nhad advanced in \u2018The Refutation of Idealism\u2019 was too\n\u2018na\u2022ve\u2019 to be tenable; he had to be able to\naccommodate \u2018false\u2019 appearances somehow. But the strategy\nMoore adopted to deal with this remained true to the basic thesis of\n\u2018The Refutation of Idealism\u2019 that one should account for\nthe appearances of things in terms of the properties of the primary\nobjects of experience, and not the qualities of experiences themselves.\nTo elaborate this position Moore introduced the term\n\u2018sense-datum\u2019 to describe these primary objects of\nexperience:</p>", "<blockquote>But now, what happened to each of us, when we saw that\nenvelope? I will begin by describing <em>part</em> of what happened to\nme. I saw a patch of a particular whitish colour, having a certain\nshape \u2026. These things: this patch of a whitish colour, and its\nsize and shape I did actually see. And I propose to call these things,\nthe colour and size and shape, <em>sense-data</em> \u2026 (<em>Some\nMain Problems of Philosophy</em> 30)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nMoore implies here that the colour, shape and size are distinct\nsense-data; but he soon revised his terminology so that these are\nregarded as properties of the visual sense-datum he \u2018actually\nsaw\u2019, or \u2018directly apprehended\u2019 as he normally\nsays.</p>", "<p>\n\nOnce the concept of a sense-datum has been introduced in this way,\nit is easy to see that false appearances can be handled by\ndistinguishing between the properties of sense-data we apprehend and\nthe properties of the physical objects which give rise to these\nsense-data. But what is the relationship between sense-data and\nphysical objects? Moore took it that there are three serious candidates\nto be considered: (i) an indirect realist position, according to which\nsense-data are non-physical but somehow produced by interactions\nbetween physical objects and our senses; (ii) the phenomenalist\nposition, according to which our conception of physical objects is\nmerely one which expresses observed and anticipated uniformities among\nthe sense-data we apprehend; (iii) a direct realist position, according\nto which sense-data are parts of physical objects \u2014 so that, for\nexample, visual sense-data are visible parts of the surfaces of\nphysical objects. The indirect realist position is that to which he was\ninitially drawn; but he could see that it leaves our beliefs about the\nphysical world exposed to skeptical doubt, since it implies that the\nobservations which constitute evidence for these beliefs concern only\nthe properties of non-physical sense-data, and there is no obvious way\nfor us to obtain further evidence to support a hypothesis about the\nproperties of the physical world and its relationship to our\nsense-data. This argument is reminiscent of Berkeley's critique of\nLocke, and Moore therefore considered carefully Berkeley's\nphenomenalist alternative. Moore's initial response to this position\nwas that the implied conception of the physical world was just too\n\u2018pickwickian\u2019 to be believable. This may be felt to be too\nintuitive, like Dr. Johnson's famous objection to Berkeley; but Moore\ncould also see that there were substantive objections to the\nphenomenalist position, such as the fact that our normal ways of\nidentifying and anticipating significant uniformities among our\nsense-data draw on our beliefs about our location in physical space and\nthe state of our physical sense-organs, neither of which are available\nto the consistent phenomenalist.</p>", "<p>\n\nSo far Moore's dialectic is familiar. What is unfamiliar is his\ndirect realist position, according to which sense-data are physical.\nThis position avoids the problems so far encountered, but in order to\naccommodate false appearances Moore has to allow that sense-data may\nlack the properties which we apprehend them as having. It may be felt\nthat in so far as sense-data are objects at all, this is inevitable;\nbut Moore now needs to provide an account of the apparent properties of\nsense-data and it is not clear how he can do this without going back on\nthe initial motivation for the sense-datum theory by construing these\napparent properties as properties of our experiences. But what in fact\nturns Moore against this direct realist position is the difficulty he\nthinks it leads to concerning the treatment of hallucinations. In such\ncases, Moore holds, any sense-data we apprehend are not parts of a\nphysical object; so direct realism cannot apply to them, and yet there\nis no reason to hold that they are intrinsically different from the\nsense-data which we apprehend in normal experience. This last point\nmight well be disputed, and at one point Moore himself considers the\npossibility of a distinction between \u2018subjective\u2019 and\n\u2018objective\u2019 sense-data; but once one has introduced\nsense-data in the first place as the primary objects of experience it\nis not going to be easy to make a distinction here without assuming\nmore about experience than Moore at any rate would have wanted to\nconcede.</p>", "<p>\n\nMoore wrote more extensively about perception than about any other\ntopic. In these writings he moves between the three alternatives set\nout here without coming to any firm conclusion. From the outside, it\nseems clear that what was leading him astray was the sense-datum\nhypothesis itself and his reflections on perception can be regarded as\nan extended <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of this hypothesis. It was\nonly towards the end of his career that he encountered in Ducasse's\nadverbial theory a serious alternative to the sense-datum hypothesis.\nBut the adverbial theory provides no easy way of avoiding the\ndifficulties Moore confronted: Moore rightly objected to Ducasse that\nit is not at all clear how the structure of a sensory field can be\nconstrued in adverbial terms. Yet there were other alternatives: in\nparticular, from the start of the twentieth century the\nphenomenological movement had offered an account of perception based\nupon a recognition of its inherent intentionality which avoids some of\nthe pitfalls of the sense-datum theory. It is, I think, a pity that\nMoore did not engage with this position, but this detachment was all\ntoo characteristic of the relationship at the time between the\nanalytical and phenomenological traditions.</p>", "<p>\n\nAn important aspect of Moore's rejection of idealism was his\naffirmation of a \u2018common sense\u2019 realist position, according\nto which our ordinary common-sense view of the world is largely\ncorrect. Moore first explicitly championed this position in his 1910-11\nlectures <em>Some Main Problems of Philosophy</em>but he made it his\nown when he responded in 1925 to an invitation to describe his\n\u2018philosophical position\u2019 by setting this out as \u2018A\nDefence of Common Sense\u2019. Moore begins the paper by listing a\nlarge number of \u2018truisms\u2019 such as that \u2018the earth had\nexisted also for many years before my body was born\u2019. Concerning\nthese truisms he then asserts, first, that he knows them for certain,\nsecond, that other people likewise know for certain the truth of\ncomparable truisms about themselves and, third, that he knows this\nsecond general truth (and, by implication, others do too). So the truth\nand general knowledge of these truisms is a matter of common sense.\nHaving set out these truisms, Moore then acknowledges that some\nphilosophers have denied their truth or, more commonly, denied our\nknowledge of them (even though, according to Moore, they also know\nthem) and he attempts to show that these denials are incoherent or\nunwarranted. These claims might seem to leave little space for radical\nphilosophical argument. But in the last part of the paper Moore argues\nthat his defence of common sense leaves completely undecided the\nquestion as to how the truistic propositions which make up the common\nsense view of the world are to be analysed; the analysis may be as\nradical as one likes as long as it is consistent with the truth and\nknowability of the propositions analysed. Thus, for example, he is\ncontent to allow that philosophical argument may show that a\nphenomenalist analysis of propositions about the physical world is\ncorrect.</p>", "<p>\n\nThis last point shows that Moore's defence of common sense is not as\nmuch of a constraint on philosophical theory as one might at first have\nthought; for philosophical analysis can reveal to us facts about the\n\u2018principal or ultimate subject\u2019 of a truistic proposition\nwhich are by no means what common sense supposes. This implication is\nimportant when one turns to consider Moore's most famous paper, his\n\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019 \u2014 the text of a British\nAcademy lecture delivered in 1939 just when Moore was retiring from his\nCambridge Professorship. Moore here sets himself the task of doing what\nKant had earlier set himself to do, namely providing a proof of the\nexistence of \u2018external objects\u2019. Much of the lecture is\ndevoted to working out what counts as an \u2018external object\u2019,\nand Moore claims that these are things whose existence is not dependent\nupon our experience. So, he argues, if he can prove the existence of\nany such things, then he will have proved the existence of an\n\u2018External World\u2019. Moore then maintains that he can do this\n\u2014</p>", "<blockquote>How? By holding up my two hands, and saying, as I make a\ncertain gesture with the right hand, \u2018Here is one hand\u2019,\nand adding, as I make a certain gesture with the left, \u2018and here\nis another\u2019 (\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019\n166).</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nMoore then goes to argue that this demonstration of his hands was a\n\u2018perfectly rigorous\u2019 proof of the existence of external\nobjects. For its premises certainly entail its conclusion and they are\nthings which he then knew to be true \u2014</p>", "<blockquote>I <em>knew</em> that there was one hand in the place\nindicated by combining a certain gesture with my first utterance of\n\u2018here\u2019 and that there was another in the different place\nindicated by combining a certain gesture with my second utterance of\n\u2018here\u2019. How absurd it would be to suggest that I did not\nknow it, but only believed it, and that perhaps it was not the case!\nYou might as well suggest that I do not know that I am now standing up\nand talking \u2014 that perhaps after all I'm not, and that it's not\nquite certain that I am! (\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019\n166)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThe significance of this performance has been debated ever since\nMoore set it out. It is commonly supposed that Moore here sets himself\nto refute philosophical skepticism; and that his performance, though\nintriguing, is unsuccessful. But this interpretation is incorrect:\nMoore's avowed aim is to prove <em>the existence</em> of an external\nworld, not to prove <em>his knowledge of the existence</em> of an\nexternal world. Moore himself set this out clearly in a subsequent\ndiscussion of his lecture:</p>", "<blockquote>I have sometimes distinguished between two different\npropositions, each of which has been made by some philosophers, namely\n(1) the proposition \u2018there are no material things\u2019 and (2)\nthe proposition \u2018Nobody knows for certain that there are any\nmaterial things\u2019. And in my latest British Academy lecture called\n\u2018Proof of an External World\u2019 \u2026 I implied with regard\nto the first of these propositions that it could be <em>proved</em> to\nbe false in such a way as this; namely, by holding up one of your hands\nand saying \u2018<em>This</em> hand is a material thing; therefore\nthere is at least one material thing\u2019. But with regard to the\nsecond of the two propositions \u2026. I do not think I have ever\nimplied that <em>it</em> could be <em>proved</em> to be false in any\nsuch simple way \u2026 (\u2018A Reply to my Critics\u2019\n668)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nSetting aside any anti-skeptical intent therefore, what needs\nassessment is the metaphysical significance of Moore's proof, as a\nproof of an \u2018external world\u2019. Clearly, everything here\ndepends on what is to count as \u2018external\u2019, in particular\nwhether Moore's demonstration of the existence of his hands proves the\nexistence of things that are in no way at all dependent upon experience\nor thought. It is, I think, obvious that it does not; for that issue is\none which depends on broader philosophical questions about idealism\nwhich cannot possibly be settled that way. Moore's own distinction\nbetween questions of truth and questions of analysis should be\nintroduced here. Moore's \u2018proof\u2019 demonstrates the\n\u2018empirical\u2019 truth of a simple truism, that he has hands;\nbut it leaves entirely open the question of the analysis of this\ntruism. Yet it is at the level of analysis that the\n\u2018transcendental\u2019 question of whether things such as hands\nare altogether independent of experience and thought is to be\nanswered.</p>", "<p>\n\nAlthough, as I have indicated, Moore did not intend his\n\u2018proof\u2019 as a refutation of skepticism, he did frequently\nargue against skeptical views; and in his early writings, despite the\npassage quoted just now, he does sometimes give the impression that he\nthinks one can refute skepticism by simply bringing forward a\nstraightforward case of knowledge, such as \u2018I know that this is a\npencil\u2019. But on examination it turns out that his strategy here\nis more subtle; he wants to argue that we get our understanding of\nknowledge primarily through straightforward cases of this kind, and\nthus that skeptical arguments are self-undermining: for, on the one\nhand, they rely on general principles about the limits of knowledge and\nthus assume some understanding of knowledge but, on the other hand,\nthey undermine this understanding by implying that there are no such\nstraightforward cases of it. The force of arguments of this kind is,\nhowever, disputable, since the skeptic can always present his argument\nas a <em>reductio ad absurdum</em> of the possibility of knowledge; and\nthe same point applies to Moore's other attempts to convict the skeptic\nof some kind of pragmatic incoherence.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn two of his last writings, \u2018Four Forms of Skepticism\u2019\nand \u2018Certainty\u2019, Moore, perhaps dissatisfied with these\nearlier arguments and with the misunderstanding of his\n\u2018proof\u2019, returned to the issue and set himself the\nchallenge of refuting Cartesian skepticism. Notoriously, by the end of\n\u2018Certainty\u2019 Moore acknowledges defeat: having agreed that\nif he does not know that he is not dreaming, then he does not know such\nthings as that he is standing up and talking, he accepts (with\nreservations) that he cannot know for certain that he is not dreaming.\nMost commentators agree that Moore lost his way here. But it is not\nclear where, since Moore makes no obvious mistake. Nonetheless the\nviability of a \u2018common sense\u2019 response to skepticism\nremains an important feature of later discussions of the topic. Moore\nwas clearly right when, for example, he remarked that despite Russell's\nfrequent skeptical professions, Russell was nonetheless perfectly sure,\nwithout a shadow of doubt, on thousands of occasions, that he was\nsitting down. But what is difficult to achieve here is a formulation of\nthe skeptical dialectic which both shows the importance of Moore's\n\u2018common sense\u2019 affirmations of certainty and yet avoids a\ndogmatic insistence that knowledge does not need to be vindicated in\nthe face of skeptical argument. I myself think that Wittgenstein's\nwritings <em>On Certainty</em>, which were much influenced by Moore,\nbest indicate how this is to be achieved, but this is not the place to\ndemonstrate this achievement.</p>", "<p>\n\nMoore was not a systematic philosopher: unlike Reid's philosophy of\ncommon sense, Moore's \u2018common sense\u2019 is not a system. Even\nin ethics, where he comes closest to presenting a \u2018theory\u2019\nhe explicitly disavows any aspiration to provide a systematic account\nof the good. Hence, as the preceding discussions show, Moore's legacy\nis primarily a collection of arguments, puzzles and challenges. One\nnotable addition to those mentioned already is \u2018Moore's\nparadox\u2019: if I am mistaken about something, then I believe\nsomething which is not the case \u2014 perhaps that it is raining when\nit is not. Yet if I attribute this mistake to myself by saying\n\u2018It's not raining but I believe that it is\u2019 my statement is\nabsurd. Why is this so? Why is it absurd for me to say something that\nit is true about myself? Moore himself thought that the explanation\nhere was just that we generally believe the things we say, so that when\nsaying \u2018It's not raining\u2019 I imply that I believe this; but\nWittgenstein rightly saw that this explanation was superficial and that\nMoore had put his finger on a much deeper phenomenon here which\nconcerns our sense of our own identity as thinkers.</p>", "<p>\n\nThis case is typical. Moore had an unparalleled ability for\nidentifying philosophical \u2018phenomena\u2019. His own discussions\nof their significance are not always satisfying; but he would be the\nfirst to acknowledge his own fallibility. What matters is that if we\nstart where he starts we can be sure that we are dealing with something\nthat will tell us something important about ourselves and the\nworld.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "moore"]}
{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-representation/", "title": "Mental Representation", "text": ["<p>\nThe Representational Theory of Mind (RTM) (which goes back at least to\nAristotle) takes as its starting point commonsense mental states, such\nas thoughts, beliefs, desires, perceptions and imagings. Such states\nare said to have \u201cintentionality\u201d \u2013 they are\n<em>about</em> or <em>refer to</em> things, and may be evaluated with\nrespect to properties like consistency, truth, appropriateness and\naccuracy. (For example, the thought that cousins are not related is\ninconsistent, the belief that Elvis is dead is true, the desire to eat\nthe moon is inappropriate, a visual experience of a ripe strawberry as\nred is accurate, an imaging of George Washington with dreadlocks is\ninaccurate.)</p>", "<p>\nRTM defines such intentional mental states as relations to mental\nrepresentations, and explains the intentionality of the former in\nterms of the semantic properties of the latter. For example, to\nbelieve that Elvis is dead is to be appropriately related to a mental\nrepresentation whose propositional content is <em>that Elvis is\ndead</em>. (The <em>desire</em> that Elvis be dead, the <em>fear</em>\nthat he is dead, the <em>regret</em> that he is dead, etc., involve\ndifferent relations to the same mental representation.) To perceive a\nstrawberry is, on the representational view, to have a sensory\nexperience of some kind which is appropriately related to (e.g.,\ncaused by) the strawberry.</p>", "<p>\nRTM also understands mental processes such as thinking, reasoning and\nimagining as sequences of intentional mental states. For example, to\nimagine the moon rising over a mountain is, <em>inter alia</em>, to\nentertain a series of mental images of the moon (and a mountain). To\ninfer a proposition <em>q</em> from the propositions <em>p</em> and\n<em>if p then q</em> is (<em>inter alia</em>) to have a sequence of\nthoughts of the form <em>p</em>, <em>if p then q</em>, <em>q</em>.</p>", "<p>\nContemporary philosophers of mind have typically supposed (or at least\n<em>hoped</em>) that the mind can be <em>naturalized</em> \u2013\ni.e., that all mental facts have explanations in the terms of natural\nscience. This assumption is shared within cognitive science, which\nattempts to provide accounts of mental states and processes in terms\n(ultimately) of features of the brain and central nervous system. In\nthe course of doing so, the various sub-disciplines of cognitive\nscience (including cognitive and computational psychology and\ncognitive and computational neuroscience) postulate a number of\ndifferent kinds of structures and processes, many of which are not\ndirectly implicated by mental states and processes as commonsensically\nconceived. There remains, however, a shared commitment to the idea\nthat mental states and processes are to be explained in terms of\nmental representations.</p>", "<p>\nIn philosophy, recent debates about mental representation have\ncentered around the existence of propositional attitudes (beliefs,\ndesires, etc.) and the determination of their contents (how they come\nto be about what they are about), and the existence of phenomenal\nproperties and their relation to the content of thought and perceptual\nexperience. Within cognitive science itself, the philosophically\nrelevant debates have been focused on the computational architecture\nof the brain and central nervous system, and the compatibility of\nscientific and commonsense accounts of mentality.</p>", "<p>\n<em>Intentional Realists</em> such as Dretske (e.g., 1988) and Fodor\n(e.g., 1987) note that the generalizations we apply in everyday life\nin predicting and explaining each other\u2019s behavior (often\ncollectively referred to as \u201cfolk psychology\u201d) are both\nremarkably successful and indispensable. What a person believes,\ndoubts, desires, fears, etc. is a highly reliable indicator of what\nthat person will do; and we have no other way of making sense of each\nother\u2019s behavior than by ascribing such states and applying the\nrelevant generalizations. We are thus committed to the basic truth of\ncommonsense psychology and, hence, to the existence of the states its\ngeneralizations refer to. (Some realists, such as Fodor, also hold\nthat commonsense psychology will be vindicated by cognitive science,\ngiven that propositional attitudes can be construed as computational\nrelations to mental representations.)</p>", "<p>\n<em>Intentional Eliminativists</em>, such as Churchland, (perhaps)\nDennett and (at one time) Stich argue that no such things as\npropositional attitudes (and their constituent representational\nstates) are implicated by the successful explanation and prediction of\nour mental lives and behavior. Churchland (1981) denies that the\ngeneralizations of commonsense propositional-attitude psychology are\ntrue. He argues that folk psychology is a theory of the mind with a\nlong history of failure and decline, and that it resists incorporation\ninto the framework of modern scientific theories (including cognitive\npsychology). As such, it is comparable to alchemy and phlogiston\ntheory, and ought to suffer a comparable fate. Commonsense psychology\nis <em>false</em>, and the states (and representations) it postulates\nsimply don\u2019t exist. (It should be noted that Churchland is not\nan eliminativist about mental representation <em>tout court</em>. See,\ne.g., Churchland 1989.)</p>", "<p>\nDennett (1987a) grants that the generalizations of commonsense\npsychology are true and indispensable, but denies that this is\nsufficient reason to believe in the entities they appear to refer to.\nHe argues that to give an intentional explanation of a system\u2019s\nbehavior is merely to adopt the \u201cintentional stance\u201d\ntoward it. If the strategy of assigning contentful states to a system\nand predicting and explaining its behavior (on the assumption that it\nis <em>rational</em> \u2013 i.e., that it behaves as it should, given\nthe propositional attitudes it should have, given its environment) is\nsuccessful, then the system is intentional, and the\npropositional-attitude generalizations we apply to it are true. But\nthere is nothing more to having a propositional attitude than this.\n(See Dennett 1987a: 29.)</p>", "<p>\nThough he has been taken to be thus claiming that intentional\nexplanations should be construed instrumentally, Dennett (1991)\ninsists that he is a \u201cmoderate\u201d realist about\npropositional attitudes, since he believes that the patterns in the\nbehavior and behavioral dispositions of a system on the basis of which\nwe (truly) attribute intentional states to it are objectively real. In\nthe event that there are two or more explanatorily adequate but\nsubstantially different systems of intentional ascriptions to an\nindividual, however, Dennett claims there is no fact of the matter\nabout what the individual believes (1987b, 1991). This does suggest an\nirrealism at least with respect to the sorts of things Fodor and\nDretske take beliefs to be; though it is not the view that there is\nsimply <em>nothing</em> in the world that makes intentional\nexplanations true.</p>", "<p>\n(Davidson 1973, 1974 and Lewis 1974 also defend the view that what it\nis to have a propositional attitude is just to be interpretable in a\nparticular way. It is, however, not entirely clear whether they intend\ntheir views to imply irrealism about propositional attitudes.)</p>", "<p>\nStich (1983) argues that cognitive psychology does not (or, in any\ncase, <em>should</em> not) taxonomize mental states by their semantic\nproperties at all, since attribution of psychological states by\ncontent is sensitive to factors that render it problematic in the\ncontext of a scientific psychology. Cognitive psychology seeks causal\nexplanations of behavior and cognition, and the causal powers of a\nmental state are determined by its intrinsic \u201cstructural\u201d\nor \u201csyntactic\u201d properties. The semantic properties of a\nmental state, however, are determined by its extrinsic properties\n\u2013 e.g., its history, environmental or intramental relations.\nHence, such properties cannot figure in causal-scientific explanations\nof behavior. (Fodor 1994 and Dretske 1988 are realist attempts to come\nto grips with some of these problems.) Stich proposes a\n<em>syntactic</em> theory of the mind, on which the semantic\nproperties of mental states play <em>no</em> explanatory role. (Stich\nhas since changed his views on a number of these issues. See Stich\n1996.)</p>", "<p>\nIt is a traditional assumption among realists about mental\nrepresentations that representational states come in two basic\nvarieties (cf. Boghossian 1995). There are those, such as thoughts,\nthat are composed of concepts and have no phenomenal\n(\u201cwhat-it\u2019s-like\u201d) features (\u201cqualia\u201d),\nand those, such as sensations, which have phenomenal features but no\nconceptual constituents. (Nonconceptual content is usually defined as\na kind of content that states of a creature lacking concepts might\nnonetheless\n have.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-1\" id=\"ref-1\">1</a>]</sup>)\n On this taxonomy, mental states can represent either in a way\nanalogous to expressions of natural languages or in a way analogous to\ndrawings, paintings, maps, photographs or movies. Perceptual states\nsuch as <em>seeing that</em> something is blue, are sometimes thought\nof as hybrid states, consisting of, for example, a non-conceptual\nsensory experience and a belief, or some more integrated compound of\nconceptual and non-conceptual elements. (There is an extensive\nliterature on the representational content of perceptual experience.\nSee the entry on the\n <a href=\"../perception-contents/\">contents of perception</a>.)</p>", "<p>\nDisagreement over non-conceptual representation concerns the existence\nand nature of phenomenal properties, the role they play in determining\nthe contents of sensory representations, and which kinds of properties\ncan be represented by non-conceptual states. Dennett (1988), for\nexample, denies that there are such things as qualia at all (as they\nare standardly construed); while Brandom (2002), McDowell (1994), Rey\n(1991) and Sellars (1956) deny that they are needed to explain the\ncontent of sensory experience. Among those who accept that experiences\nhave phenomenal content, some (Dretske, Lycan, Tye) argue that it is\nreducible to a kind of intentional content, while others (Block, Loar,\nPeacocke) argue that it is irreducible. (See the discussion in the\nnext section.) A further debate concerns the non-conceptual\nrepresentability of high-level properties such as kind properties and\nmoral properties. (See, e.g., Dretske 1995 and Siegel 2010, and the\nentry on the contents of perception.) </p>", "<p>\nSome historical discussions of the representational properties of mind\n(e.g., Aristotle <em>De Anima</em>, Locke 1689/1975, Hume 1739/1978)\nseem to assume that nonconceptual representations \u2013 percepts\n(\u201cimpressions\u201d), images (\u201cideas\u201d) and the like\n\u2013 are the only (or at least the main) kinds of mental\nrepresentations, and that the mind represents the world in virtue of\nbeing in states that <em>resemble</em> things in it. On such a view,\nall representational states have their content in virtue of their\nsensory phenomenal features. Powerful arguments, however, focusing on\nthe lack of generality (Berkeley <em>Principles of Human\nKnowledge</em>), ambiguity (Wittgenstein 1953) and\nnon-compositionality (Fodor 1981d) of sensory and imagistic\nrepresentations, as well as their unsuitability to function as logical\n(Frege 1918/1997, Geach 1957) or mathematical (Frege 1884/1953)\nconcepts, and the symmetry of resemblance (Goodman 1976), convinced\nphilosophers that no theory of mind can get by with only nonconceptual\nrepresentations construed in this way. (For more discussion, see the\nentry on\n <a href=\"../content-nonconceptual/\">nonconceputal mental content</a>.)</p>", "<p>\nThere has also been dissent from the traditional claim that conceptual\nrepresentations (thoughts, beliefs) lack phenomenology.

If this claim is correct, the question of what role\nphenomenology plays in the determination of representational content\nre-arises for conceptual representation; and the eliminativist\nambitions of Sellars, Brandom, Rey, et al. would meet a new obstacle.\nIt would also raise prima facie problems for reductive\nrepresentationalism, as well as for reductive naturalistic theories of\nintentional content, and externalism in general.</p>", "<p>\nThe view that there is a proprietary phenomenology of conscious\nthought \u2013 a <em>cognitive</em> (<em>conceptual</em>,\n<em>propositional</em>) phenomenology \u2013 claims that there is\nsomething it\u2019s like to occurrently, consciously think a thought\n(entertain a propositional content), which is as different from other\nkinds of phenomenology (visual, auditory, etc.) as they are from each\nother. Opinions diverge, however, with respect to the role such\nphenomenology plays in determining the <em>contents</em> of\nconceptual/propositional representations. Some (e.g., Siewert) claim\nthat it plays no such role. Others (e.g., Horgan and Tienson,\nStrawson) hold that it determines only \u201cnarrow\u201d contents,\nfurther, \u201cbroad\u201d contents being determined by extrinsic\nrelations to represented objects and properties. Still others (e.g.,\nFarkas 2008b, Pitt) argue that it is the <em>only</em> kind of\nconceptual content, insisting on a sharp distinction between content\n(sense) and reference.

See Chalmers 2004a). As a reductive\nclaim, it means that the phenomenal content of an experience, the\nproperties that characterize what it is like to have it (i.e.,\n<i>qualia</i>), are certain extrinsic properties it represents. For\nexample, the blueness one might mention in describing one\u2019s\nexperience (perceptual representation) of a clear sky at noon is a\nproperty of the sky, not of one\u2019s experience of it. Blueness is\nrelevant to the characterization of one\u2019s experience because\none\u2019s experience <i>represents</i> it, not because one\u2019s\nexperience <i>instantiates</i> it. An experience of the sky no more\ninstantiates blueness than a thought that snow is cold instantiates\ncoldness. On this view, the phenomenal content of sensory experience\nis explained as its representation of extrinsic properties. (See Byrne\nand Tye 2006, Dretske 1995, Harman 1990, Lycan 1987, 1996 and Tye\n2014, 2015 for elaboration and defense of this \u201cqualia\nexternalism.\u201d See Thompson 2008 and Pitt 2017 for objections to\nthis account.)

Among\nphenomenalists there is disagreement over whether non-conceptual\nrepresentation requires complex structuring of phenomenal properties\n(Block and Peacocke, op. cit., Robinson 1994) or not (Loar 2003b).\nSo-called \u201cGanzfeld\u201d experiences, in which, for example,\nthe visual field is completely taken up with a uniform experience of a\nsingle color, are a standard test case: Do Ganzfeld experiences\n<i>represent</i> anything? (It may be that doubts about the\nrepresentationality of such experiences are simply a consequence of\nthe fact that (outside of the laboratory) we never encounter things\nthat would produce them. Supposing we routinely did (and especially if\nwe had names for them), it seems unlikely such skepticism would\narise.)</p>", "<p>\nMost (reductive) representationalists are motivated by the conviction\nthat one or another naturalistic explanation of intentionality (see\nthe next section) is, in broad outline, correct, and by the desire to\ncomplete the naturalization of the mental by applying such theories to\nthe problem of phenomenality. (Needless to say, many phenomenalists\nare just as eager to naturalize the phenomenal \u2013 though not in\nthe same way.)</p>", "<p>\nThe main argument for representationalism appeals to the\n<em>transparency</em> of experience (cf. Tye 2000: 45\u201351). The\nproperties that characterize what it\u2019s like to have a sensory\nexperience are presented in experience as properties of objects\nperceived: in attempting to attend to an experience, one seems to\n\u201csee through it\u201d to the objects and properties it is\nexperiences\n <em>of</em>.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-2\" id=\"ref-2\">2</a>]</sup>\n They are not presented as properties of the experience itself. If\nnonetheless they <em>were</em> properties of the experience,\nperception would be massively deceptive. But perception is not\nmassively deceptive. In veridical perception, these properties are\nlocally instantiated; in illusion and hallucination, they are not. On\nthis view, introspection is indirect perception: one comes to know\nwhat phenomenal features one\u2019s experience has by coming to know\nwhat objective features it represents. (Cf. also Dretske 1996,\n1999.)</p>", "<p>\nIn order to account for the intuitive differences between conceptual\nand sensory representations, representationalists appeal to structural\nor functional properties. Dretske (1995), for example, distinguishes\nexperiences and thoughts on the basis of the origin and nature of\ntheir functions: an experience of a property <em>P</em> is a state of\na system whose <em>evolved</em> function is to indicate the presence\nof <em>P</em> in the environment; a thought representing the property\n<em>P</em>, on the other hand, is a state of a system whose\n<em>assigned</em> (learned) function is to calibrate the output of the\nexperiential system. Rey (1991) takes both thoughts and experiences to\nbe relations to sentences in the language of thought, and\ndistinguishes them on the basis of (the functional roles of) such\nsentences\u2019 constituent predicates. Lycan (1987, 1996)\ndistinguishes them in terms of their functional-computational\nprofiles. Tye (2000) distinguishes them in terms of their functional\nroles and the intrinsic structure of their vehicles: thoughts are\nrepresentations in a language-like medium, whereas experiences are\nimage-like representations consisting of \u201csymbol-filled\narrays.\u201d (Cf. the account of mental images in Tye 1991.)</p>", "<p>\nPhenomenalists tend to make use of the same sorts of features\n(function, intrinsic structure) in explaining some of the intuitive\ndifferences between thoughts and experiences; but they do not suppose\nthat such features exhaust the differences between phenomenal and\nnon-phenomenal representations. For the phenomenalist, it is the\nphenomenal properties of experiences \u2013 qualia themselves \u2013\nthat constitute the fundamental difference between experience and\nthought. Peacocke (1992), for example, develops the notion of a\nperceptual \u201cscenario\u201d (an assignment of phenomenal\nproperties to coordinates of a three-dimensional egocentric space),\nwhose content is \u201ccorrect\u201d (a semantic property) if in the\ncorresponding \u201cscene\u201d (the portion of the external world\nrepresented by the scenario) properties are distributed as their\nphenomenal analogues are in the scenario.</p>", "<p>\nAnother sort of representation appealed to by some phenomenalists\n(e.g., Chalmers (2003), Block (2003)) is what Chalmers calls a\n\u201cpure phenomenal concept.\u201d A phenomenal concept in general\nis a concept whose denotation is a phenomenal property, and it may be\ndiscursive (\u2018the color of ripe bananas\u2019), demonstrative\n(\u2018<em>this</em> color\u2019; Loar 1990/96)), or even more\ndirect. On Chalmers\u2019s view, a <em>pure</em> phenomenal concept\nis (something like) a conceptual/phenomenal hybrid consisting of a\nphenomenological \u201csample\u201d (an image or an occurrent\nsensation) integrated with (or functioning as) a conceptual component\n(see also Balog 1999 and Papineau 2002). Phenomenal concepts are\npostulated to account for the apparent fact (among others) that, as\nMcGinn (1991b) puts it, \u201cyou cannot form [introspective]\nconcepts of conscious properties unless you yourself instantiate those\nproperties.\u201d One cannot have a phenomenal concept of a\nphenomenal property <em>P</em>, and, hence, phenomenal\n<em>beliefs</em> about <em>P</em>, without having experience of\n<em>P</em>, because <em>P</em> itself is (in some way)\n<em>constitutive</em> of the concept of <em>P</em>.

(An analog/digital distinction may also be made with respect to\ncognitive <em>processes</em>. (Block 1983.)) On this understanding of\nthe analog/digital distinction, imagistic representations, which\nrepresent in virtue of properties that may vary continuously (such as\nbeing more or less bright, loud, vivid, etc.), would be analog, while\nconceptual representations, whose properties do not vary continuously\n(a thought cannot be more or less about Elvis: either it is or it is\nnot) would be digital.</p>", "<p>\nIt might be supposed that the pictorial/discursive distinction is best\nmade in terms of the phenomenal/non-phenomenal distinction, but it is\nnot obvious that this is the case.

That is, the semantics of both language and thought is\n<em>compositional</em>: the content of a complex representation is\ndetermined by the contents of its constituents and their structural\nconfiguration. (See, e.g.,Fodor and Lepore 2002.) </p>", "<p>\nConnectionists are motivated mainly by a consideration of the\narchitecture of the brain, which apparently consists of layered\nnetworks of interconnected neurons. They argue that this sort of\narchitecture is unsuited to carrying out classical serial\ncomputations. For one thing, processing in the brain is typically\nmassively parallel. In addition, the elements whose manipulation\ndrives computation in connectionist networks (principally, the\nconnections between nodes) are neither semantically compositional nor\nsemantically evaluable, as they are on the classical approach. This\ncontrast with classical computationalism is often characterized by\nsaying that representation is, with respect to computation,\n<em>distributed</em> as opposed to <em>local</em>: representation is\nlocal if it is computationally basic; and distributed if it is not.\n(Another way of putting this is to say that for classicists mental\nrepresentations are computationally <em>atomic</em>, whereas for\nconnectionists they are not.)</p>", "<p>\nMoreover, connectionists argue that information processing as it\noccurs in connectionist networks more closely resembles some features\nof actual human cognitive functioning. For example, whereas on the\nclassical view learning involves something like hypothesis formation\nand testing (Fodor 1981c), on the connectionist model it is a matter\nof evolving distribution of \u201cweights\u201d (strengths) on the\nconnections between nodes, and typically does not involve the\nformulation of hypotheses regarding the identity conditions for the\nobjects of knowledge. The connectionist network is \u201ctrained\nup\u201d by repeated exposure to the objects it is to learn to\ndistinguish; and, though networks typically require <em>many</em> more\nexposures to the objects than do humans, this seems to model at least\none feature of this type of human learning quite well. (Cf. the sonar\nexample in Churchland 1989.)</p>", "<p>\nFurther, degradation in the performance of such networks in response\nto damage is gradual, not sudden as in the case of a classical\ninformation processor, and hence more accurately models the loss of\nhuman cognitive function as it typically occurs in response to brain\ndamage. It is also sometimes claimed that connectionist systems show\nthe kind of flexibility in response to novel situations typical of\nhuman cognition \u2013 situations in which classical systems are\nrelatively \u201cbrittle\u201d or \u201cfragile.\u201d</p>", "<p>\nSome philosophers have maintained that connectionism entails that\nthere are no propositional attitudes. Ramsey, Stich and Garon (1990)\nhave argued that if connectionist models of cognition are basically\ncorrect, then there are no discrete representational states as\nconceived in ordinary commonsense psychology and classical cognitive\nscience. Others, however (e.g., Smolensky 1989), hold that certain\ntypes of higher-level patterns of activity in a neural network may be\nroughly identified with the representational states of commonsense\npsychology. Still others (e.g., Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn 1988, Heil 1991,\nHorgan and Tienson 1996) argue that language-of-thought style\nrepresentation is both necessary in general and realizable within\nconnectionist architectures. (MacDonald &amp; MacDonald 1995 collects\nthe central contemporary papers in the classicist/connectionist\ndebate, and provides useful introductory material as well.

He argues that cognitive systems are <em>dynamic</em>,\nand that cognitive states are not relations to mental symbols, but\nquantifiable states of a complex system consisting of (in the case of\nhuman beings) a nervous system, a body and the environment in which\nthey are embedded. Cognitive processes are not rule-governed sequences\nof discrete symbolic states, but continuous, evolving total states of\ndynamic systems determined by continuous, simultaneous and mutually\ndetermining states of the systems\u2019 components. Representation in\na dynamic system is essentially information-theoretic, though the\nbearers of information are not symbols, but state variables or\nparameters.

CTM attempts to <em>reduce</em> the\nintentionality of such states to the intentionality of the mental\nsymbols they are relations to. But, Horst claims, the relevant notion\nof symbolic content is essentially bound up with the notions of\nconvention and intention.

(These values may\nbut need not be expressions.) On what is possibly the oldest way of\nunderstanding the logical modality, that modal force is entirely due\nto this property: thus, for example, on this view to say that (1) must\nbe true can only mean that (1) is a particular case of the true\nuniversal generalization \u201cFor all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\), \\(a\\)\nand \\(b\\), if \\(a\\) is a \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is a \\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is\na \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is a \\(Q\\)\u201d. On one traditional (but not\nuncontroversial) interpretation, Aristotle's claim that the conclusion\nof a <em>syllogismos</em> must be true if the premises are true ought\nto be understood in this way. In a famous passage of the <em>Prior\nAnalytics</em>, he says: \u201cA <em>syllogismos</em> is speech\n(<em>logos</em>) in which, certain things being supposed, something\nother than the things supposed results of necessity (<em>ex\nanankes</em>) because they are so\u201d (24b18\u201320).

For this interpretation see e.g.  Alexander of\nAphrodisias, 208.16 (quoted by \u0141ukasiewicz 1957, \u00a741),\nBolzano (1837, \u00a7155) and \u0141ukasiewicz (1957, \u00a75).</p>", "<p>\n\nIn many other ancient and medieval logicians, \u201cmust\u201d claims are\nunderstood as universal generalizations about actual items (even if\nthey are not always understood as universal generalizations on\n\u201cformal\u201d schemata). Especially prominent is Diodorus' view that a\nproposition is necessary just in case it is true at all times (see\nMates 1961, III, \u00a73). Note that this makes sense of the idea that\n(2) must be true but, say, \u201cPeople watch TV\u201d could be false, for\nsurely this sentence was not true in Diodorus' time. Diodorus' view\nappears to have been very common in the Middle Ages, when authors like\nWilliam of Sherwood and Walter Burley seem to have understood the\nperceived necessity of conditionals like (2) as truth at all times\n(see Knuuttila 1982, pp. 348\u20139). An understanding of necessity as\neternity is frequent also in later authors; see e.g.,\nKant, <em>Critique of Pure Reason</em>, B 184. In favor of the\nmentioned interpretation of Aristotle and of the Diodorean view it\nmight be pointed out that we often use modal locutions to stress the\nconsequents of conditionals that follow from mere universal\ngeneralizations about the actual world, as in \u201cIf gas prices go up,\nnecessarily the economy slows down\u201d.</p>", "<p>\n\nMany authors have thought that views of this sort do not account for\nthe full strength of the modal import of logical truths. A nowadays\nvery common, but (apparently) late view in the history of philosophy,\nis that the necessity of a logical truth does not merely imply that\nsome generalization about actual items holds, but also implies that\nthe truth would have been true at a whole range of counterfactual\ncircumstances. Leibniz assigned this property to necessary truths such\nas those of logic and geometry, and seems to have been one of the\nfirst to speak of the counterfactual circumstances as \u201cpossible\nuniverses\u201d or worlds (see the letter to Bourguet, pp. 572\u20133, for a\ncrisp statement of his views that contrasts them with the views in the\npreceding paragraph; Knuuttila 1982, pp. 353 ff. detects the earliest\ntransparent talk of counterfactual circumstances and of necessity\nunderstood as at least implying truth in all of these in\nDuns Scotus and\nBuridan; see also the entry on\n <a href=\"../modality-medieval/\">medieval theories of modality</a>).\n In contemporary writings the understanding of necessity as truth in\nall counterfactual circumstances, and the view that logical truths are\nnecessary in this sense, are widespread\u2014although many, perhaps\nmost, authors adopt \u201creductivist\u201d views of modality that see talk of\ncounterfactual circumstances as no more than disguised talk about\ncertain actualized (possibly abstract) items, such as linguistic\ndescriptions. Even Leibniz seems to have thought of his \u201cpossible\nuniverses\u201d as ideas in the mind of God. (See Lewis 1986 for an\nintroduction to the contemporary polemics in this area.)</p>", "<p>\n\nHowever, even after Leibniz and up to the present, many logicians seem\nto have avoided a commitment to a strong notion of necessity as truth\nin all (actual and) counterfactual circumstances. Thus Bolzano, in\nline with his interpretation of Aristotle mentioned above,\ncharacterizes necessary propositions as those whose negation is\nincompatible with purely general truths (see Bolzano 1837, \u00a7119).\nFrege says that \u201cthe apodictic judgment [i.e., roughly, the\njudgment whose content begins with a \u201cnecessarily\u201d\ngoverning the rest of the content] is distinguished from the assertory\nin that it suggests the existence of universal judgments from which\nthe proposition can be inferred, while in the case of the assertory\none such a suggestion is lacking\u201d (Frege 1879, \u00a74).  Tarski\nis even closer to the view traditionally attributed to Aristotle, for\nit is pretty clear that for him to say that e.g. (2c)\n\u201cmust\u201d be true if (2a) and (2b) are true is to say that\n(2) is a particular case of the \u201cformal\u201d generalization\n\u201cFor all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), if\nno \\(Q\\) is \\(R\\) and some \\(P\\)s are \\(Q\\)s, then\nsome \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\)\u201d (see Tarski 1936a, pp. 411,\n415, 417, or the corresponding passages in Tarski 1936b; see also Ray\n1996).  Quine is known for his explicit rejection of any modality that\ncannot be understood in terms of universal generalizations about the\nactual world (see especially Quine 1963). In some of these cases, this\nattitude is explained by a distrust of notions that are thought not to\nhave reached a fully respectable scientific status, like the strong\nmodal notions; it is frequently accompanied in such authors, who are\noften practicing logicians, by the proposal to characterize logical\ntruth as a species of validity (in the sense of 2.3 below).</p>", "<p>\n\nOn a recent view developed by Beall and Restall (2000, 2006), called\nby them \u201clogical pluralism\u201d, the concept of logical truth\ncarries a commitment to the idea that a logical truth is true in all\nof a range of items or \u201ccases\u201d, and its necessity consists\nin the truth of such a general claim (see Beall and Restall 2006,\np. 24). However, the concept of logical truth does not single out a\nunique range of \u201ccases\u201d as privileged in determining an\nextension for the concept; instead, there are many such equally\nacceptable ranges and corresponding extensions, which may be chosen as\na function of contextual interests. This means that, for the logical\npluralist, many sets have a right to be called \u201cthe set\nof logical truths\u201d (and \u201cthe set of logical necessities\u201d),\neach in the appropriate\n context.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-3\" id=\"ref-3\">3</a>]</sup> \n(See the entry on\n <a href=\"../logical-pluralism/\">logical pluralism</a>.) \nOn another recent understanding of logical necessity as a species of\ngenerality, proposed by Rumfitt (2015), the necessity of a logical\ntruth consists just in its being usable under all sets of\nsubject-specific ways of drawing implications (provided these sets\nsatisfy certain structural rules); or, more roughly, just in its being\napplicable no matter what sort of reasoning is at stake. On this view,\na more substantive understanding of the modality at stake in logical\ntruth is again not required. It may be noted that, although he\npostulates a variety of subject-specific implication relations,\nRumfitt rejects pluralism about logical truth in the sense of Beall\nand Restall (see his 2015, p. 56, n. 23.), and in fact thinks that the\nset of logical truths is characterized by the standard classical\nlogic.</p>", "<p>\n\nYet another sense in which it has been thought that truths like\n(1)-(3), and logical truths quite generally, \u201ccould\u201d not\nbe false or \u201cmust\u201d be true is epistemic. It is an old\nobservation, going at least as far back as Plato, that some truths\ncount as intuitively known by us even in cases where we don't seem to\nhave any empirical grounds for them. Truths that are knowable on\nnon-empirical grounds are called <em>a priori</em> (an expression that\nbegins to be used with this meaning around the time of Leibniz; see\ne.g. his \u201cPrim\u00e6 Veritates\u201d, p. 518). The axioms and\ntheorems of mathematics, the lexicographic and stipulative\ndefinitions, and also the paradigmatic logical truths, have been given\nas examples.  If it is accepted that logical truths are <em>a\npriori</em>, it is natural to think that they must be true or could\nnot be false at least partly in the strong sense that their negations\nare incompatible with what we are able to know non-empirically.</p>", "<p>\n\nAssuming that such <em>a priori</em> knowledge exists in some way or\nother, much recent philosophy has occupied itself with the issue of\nhow it is possible. One traditional (\u201crationalist\u201d) view\nis that the mind is equipped with a special capacity to perceive\ntruths through the examination of the relations between pure ideas or\nconcepts, and that the truths reached through the correct operation of\nthis capacity count as known <em>a priori</em>. (See, e.g., Leibniz's\n\u201cDiscours de M\u00e9taphysique\u201d, \u00a7\u00a723 ff.;\nRussell 1912, p. 105; BonJour 1998 is a very recent example of a view\nof this sort.) An opposing traditional (\u201cempiricist\u201d) view\nis that there is no reason to postulate that capacity, or even that\nthere are reasons not to postulate it, such as that it is\n\u201cmysterious\u201d. (See the entry on\n <a href=\"../rationalism-empiricism/\">rationalism vs. empiricism</a>.)\n Some philosophers, empiricists and otherwise, have attempted to\nexplain <em>a priori</em> knowledge as arising from some sort of\nconvention\nor tacit agreement to assent to certain sentences\n(such as (1)) and use certain rules.\nHobbes in his objections to Descartes'\n<em>Meditations</em> (\u201cThird Objections\u201d, IV, p. 608)\nproposes a wide-ranging conventionalist view.  The later Wittgenstein\n(on one interpretation) and Carnap are distinguished proponents of\n\u201ctacit agreement\u201d and conventionalist views (see e.g.\nWittgenstein 1978, I.9, I.142; Carnap 1939, \u00a712, and 1963, p.\n916, for informal exposition of Carnap's views; see also Coffa 1991,\nchs. 14 and 17). Strictly speaking, Wittgenstein and Carnap think that\nlogical truths do not express propositions at all, and are just\nvacuous sentences that for some reason or other we find useful to\nmanipulate; thus it is only in a somewhat diminished sense that we can\nspeak of (<em>a priori</em>) knowledge of them. However, in typical\nrecent exponents of \u201ctacit agreement\u201d and conventionalist\nviews, such as Boghossian (1997), the claim that logical truths do not\nexpress propositions is rejected, and it is accepted that the\nexistence of the agreement provides full-blown <em>a priori</em>\nknowledge of those propositions.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe \u201crational capacity\u201d view and the\n\u201cconventionalist\u201d view agree that, in a broad sense, the\nepistemic ground of logical truths resides in our ability to analyze\nthe meanings of their expressions, be these understood as conventions\nor as objective ideas. For this reason it can be said that they\nexplain the apriority of logical truths in terms of their analyticity. \n(See the entry on the\n <a href=\"../analytic-synthetic/\">analytic/synthetic distinction</a>.)\nKant's explanation of the apriority of logical truths has seemed harder to \nextricate.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-4\" id=\"ref-4\">4</a>]</sup> \nA long line of commentators of Kant has noted that, if Kant's view is\nthat all logical truths are analytic, this would seem to be in tension\nwith his characterizations of analytic truths. Kant characterizes\nanalytic truths as those where the concept of the predicate is\ncontained in or identical with the concept of the subject, and, more\nfundamentally, as those whose denial is contradictory. But it has\nappeared to those commentators that these characterizations, while\napplying to strict tautologies such as \u201cMen are men\u201d or\n\u201cBearded men are men\u201d, would seem to leave out much of\nwhat Kant himself counts as logically true, including syllogisms such\nas (2) (see e.g. Mill 1843, bk. II, ch. vi, \u00a75; Husserl 1901,\nvol. II, pt. 2, \u00a766; Kneale and Kneale 1962, pp. 357\u20138;\nParsons 1967; Maddy 1999). This and the apparent lack of clear\npronouncements of Kant on the issue has led at least Maddy (1999) and\nHanna (2001) to consider (though not accept) the hypothesis that Kant\nviewed some logical truths as synthetic <em>a priori</em>. On an\ninterpretation of this sort, the apriority of many logical truths\nwould be explained by the fact that they would be required by the\ncognitive structure of the transcendental subject, and specifically by\nthe forms of \n judgment.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-5\" id=\"ref-5\">5</a>]</sup> \nBut the standard interpretation is to attribute to Kant the view that\nall logical truths are analytic (see e.g. Capozzi and Roncaglia\n2009). On an interpretation of this sort, Kant's forms of judgment may\nbe identified with logical concepts susceptible of analysis (see\ne.g. Allison 1983, pp. 126ff.). An extended defense of the\ninterpretation that Kant viewed all logical truths as analytic,\nincluding a vindication of Kant against the objections of the line of\ncommentators mentioned above, can be found in Hanna (2001),\n\u00a73.1. A substantively Kantian contemporary theory of the\nepistemology of logic and its roots in cognition is developed in Hanna\n(2006); this theory does not seek to explain the apriority of logic in\nterms of its analyticity, and appeals instead to a specific kind of\nlogical intuition and a specific cognitive logic faculty. (Compare\nalso the anti-aprioristic and anti-analytic but broadly Kantian view\nof Maddy 2007, mentioned below.)</p>", "<p>\n\nThe early Wittgenstein shares with Kant the idea that the logical\nexpressions do not express meanings in the way that non-logical\nexpressions do (see 1921, 4.0312). Consistently with this view, he\nclaims that logical truths do not \u201csay\u201d anything (1921,\n6.11). But he seems to reject conventionalist and \u201ctacit\nagreement\u201d views (1921, 6.124, 6.1223). It is not that logical\ntruths do not say anything because they are mere instruments for some\nsort of extrinsically useful manipulation; rather, they\n\u201cshow\u201d the \u201clogical properties\u201d that the world\nhas independently of our decisions (1921, 6.12, 6.13). It is unclear\nhow apriority is explainable in this framework. Wittgenstein calls the\nlogical truths analytic (1921, 6.11), and says that \u201cone can\nrecognize in the symbol alone that they are true\u201d (1921,\n6.113). He seems to have in mind the fact that one can\n\u201csee\u201d that a logical truth of truth-functional logic must\nbe valid by inspection of a suitable representation of its\ntruth-functional content (1921, 6.1203, 6.122). But the extension of\nthe idea to quantificational logic is problematic, despite\nWittgenstein's efforts to reduce quantificational logic to\ntruth-functional logic; as we now know, there is no algorithm for\ndeciding if a quantificational sentence is valid. What is perhaps more\nimportant, Wittgenstein gives no discernible explanation of why in\nprinciple all the \u201clogical properties\u201d of the world should\nbe susceptible of being reflected in an adequate notation.</p>", "<p>\n\nAgainst the \u201crational capacity\u201d,\n\u201cconventionalist\u201d, Kantian and early Wittgensteinian\nviews, other philosophers, especially radical empiricists and\nnaturalists (not to speak of epistemological skeptics), have rejected\nthe claim that <em>a priori</em> knowledge exists (hence by\nimplication also the claim that analytic propositions exist), and they\nhave proposed instead that there is only an illusion of apriority.\nOften this rejection has been accompanied by criticism of the other\nviews.  J.S. Mill thought that propositions like (2) seem <em>a\npriori</em> merely because they are particular cases of early and very\nfamiliar generalizations that we derive from experience, like\n\u201cFor all suitable \\(P\\), \\(Q\\) and\n\\(R\\), if no \\(Q\\) is \\(R\\) and some \\(P\\)s are\n\\(Q\\)s, then some \\(P\\)s are not \\(R\\)\u201d (see Mill\n1843, bk. II, ch. viii). Bolzano held a similar view (see Bolzano\n1837, \u00a7315). Quine (1936, \u00a7III) famously criticized the\nHobbesian view noting that since the logical truths are potentially\ninfinite, our ground for them must not lie just in a finite number of\nexplicit conventions, for logical rules are presumably needed to\nderive an infinite number of logical truths from a finite number of\nconventions (a point derived from Carroll 1895). Later Quine\n(especially 1954) criticized Carnap's conventionalist view, largely on\nthe grounds that there seems to be no non-vague distinction between\nconventional truths and truths that are tacitly left open for\nrefutation, and that to the extent that some truths are the product of\nconvention or \u201ctacit agreement\u201d, such agreement is\ncharacteristic of many scientific hypotheses and other postulations\nthat seem paradigmatically non-analytic. (See Grice and Strawson 1956\nand Carnap 1963 for reactions to these criticisms.)  Quine (especially\n1951) also argued that accepted sentences in general, including\nparadigmatic logical truths, can be best seen as something like\nhypotheses that are used to deal with experience, any of which can be\nrejected if this helps make sense of the empirical world (see Putnam\n1968 for a similar view and a purported example). On this view there\ncannot be strictly <em>a priori</em> grounds for any truth. Three\nrecent subtle anti-aprioristic positions are Maddy's (2002, 2007),\nAzzouni's (2006, 2008), and Sher's (2013). For Maddy, logical truths\nare <em>a posteriori</em>, but they cannot be disconfirmed merely by\nobservation and experiment, since they form part of very basic ways of\nthinking of ours, deeply embedded in our conceptual machinery (a\nconceptual machinery that is structurally similar to Kant's postulated\ntranscendental organization of the understanding). Similarly, for\nAzzouni logical truths are equally <em>a posteriori</em>, though our\nsense that they must be true comes from their being psychologically\ndeeply ingrained; unlike Maddy, however, Azzouni thinks that the\nlogical rules by which we reason are opaque to introspection. Sher\nprovides an attempt at combining a Quinean epistemology of logic with\na commitment to a metaphysically realist view of the modal ground of\nlogical truth.</p>", "<p>\n\nOne way in which <em>a priori</em> knowledge of a logical truth such\nas (1) would be possible would be if <em>a priori</em> knowledge of\nthe fact that (1) is a logical truth, or of the universal\ngeneralization \u201cFor all\nsuitable \\(a\\), \\(P\\), \\(b\\) and \\(Q\\),\nif \\(a\\) is \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\)\u201d were possible. One especially noteworthy kind of\nskeptical consideration in the epistemology of logic is that the\npossibility of inferential <em>a priori</em> knowledge of these facts\nseems to face a problem of circularity or of infinite regress. If we\nare to obtain inferential <em>a priori</em> knowledge of those facts,\nthen we will presumably follow logical rules at some point, including\npossibly the rule of <em>modus ponens</em> whose very correctness\nmight well depend in part on the fact that (1) is a logical truth or\non the truth of the universal generalization \u201cFor all\nsuitable \\(a\\), \\(P\\), \\(b\\) and \\(Q\\),\nif \\(a\\) is \\(P\\) only if \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\), and \\(a\\) is \\(P\\), then \\(b\\) is\n\\(Q\\)\u201d. In any case, it seems clear that not all claims of\nthis latter kind, expressing that a certain truth is a logical truth\nor that a certain logical schema is truth-preserving, could be given\nan <em>a priori</em> inferential justification without the use of some\nof the same logical rules whose correctness they might be thought to\ncodify. The point can again be reasonably derived from Carroll\n(1895). Some of the recent literature on this consideration, and on\nanti-skeptical rejoinders, includes Dummett (1973, 1991) and\nBoghossian (2000).</p>", "<p>\n\nOn most views, even if it were true that logical truths are true in\nall counterfactual circumstances, <em>a priori</em>, and analytic,\nthis would not give sufficient conditions for a truth to be a logical\ntruth. On most views, a logical truth also has to be in some sense\n\u201cformal\u201d, and this implies at least that all truths that\nare replacement instances of its form are logical truths too (and\nhence, on the assumption of the preceding sentence, true in all\ncounterfactual circumstances, <em>a priori</em>, and analytic). To use\na slight modification of an example of Albert of Saxony (quoted by\nBoche\u0144ski 1956, \u00a730.07), \u201cIf a widow runs, then a\nfemale runs\u201d should be true in all counterfactual\ncircumstances, <em>a priori</em>, and analytic if any truth\nis. However, \u201cIf a widow runs, then a log runs\u201d is a\nreplacement instance of its form, and in fact it even has the same\nform on any view of logical form (something like \u201cIf\na \\(P\\) \\(Q\\)s, then an \\(R\\) \\(Q\\)s\u201d), but\nit is not even true <em>simpliciter</em>. So on most views, \u201cIf\na widow runs, then a female runs\u201d is not a logical truth.</p>", "<p>\n\nFor philosophers who accept the idea of formality, as we said above,\nthe logical form of a sentence is a certain schema in which the\nexpressions that are not schematic letters are widely applicable\nacross different areas of\n discourse.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-6\" id=\"ref-6\">6</a>]</sup> \nIf the schema is the form of a logical truth, all of its replacement\ninstances are logical truths. The idea that logic is especially\nconcerned with (replacement instances of) schemata is of course\nevident beginning with Aristotle and the Stoics, in all of whom the\nword usually translated by \u201cfigure\u201d is\nprecisely <em>schema</em>. In Aristotle a figure is actually an even\nmore abstract form of a group of what we would now call\n\u201cschemata\u201d, such as (2\u2032). Our schemata are closer to\nwhat in the Aristotelian syllogistic are the moods; but there seems to\nbe no word for \u201cmood\u201d in Aristotle (except\npossibly <em>ptoseon</em> in 42b30 or <em>tropon</em> in 43a10; see\nSmith 1989, pp. 148\u20139), and thus no general reflection on the\nnotion of formal schemata.

The matter are the values of the schematic\nletters.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe idea that the non-schematic expressions in logical forms, i.e.\nthe logical expressions, are widely applicable across different areas\nof discourse is also present from the beginning of logic, and recurs\nin all the great logicians. It appears indirectly in many passages\nfrom Aristotle, such as the following: \u201cAll the sciences are\nrelated through the common things (I call common those which they use\nin order to demonstrate from them, but not those that are demonstrated\nin them or those about which something is demonstrated); and logic is\nrelated to them all, as it is a science that attempts to demonstrate\nuniversally the common things\u201d (<em>Posterior Analytics</em>,\n77a26\u20139); \u201cwe don't need to take hold of the things of all\nrefutations, but only of those that are characteristic of logic; for\nthese are common to every technique and ability\u201d\n(<em>Sophistical Refutations</em>, 170a34\u20135).  (In these texts\n\u201clogic\u201d is an appropriate translation of\n<em>dialektike</em>; see Kneale and Kneale 1962, I, \u00a73, who\ninform us that <em>logike</em> is used for the first time with its\ncurrent meaning in Alexander of Aphrodisias.) Frege says that \u201cthe\nfirmest proof is obviously the purely logical, which, prescinding from\nthe particularity of things, is based solely on the laws on which all\nknowledge rests\u201d (1879, p. 48; see also 1885, where the universal\napplicability of the arithmetical concepts is taken as a sign of their\nlogicality). The same idea is conspicuous as well in Tarski (1941, ch.\nII, \u00a76).</p>", "<p>\n\nThat logical expressions include paradigmatic cases like\n\u201cif\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201csome\u201d,\n\u201call\u201d, etc., and that they must be widely applicable\nacross different areas of discourse is what we might call \u201cthe\nminimal thesis\u201d about logical expressions. But beyond this there\nis little if any agreement about what generic feature makes an\nexpression logical, and hence about what determines the logical form\nof a sentence. Most authors sympathetic to the idea that logic is\nformal have tried to go beyond the minimal thesis. It would be\ngenerally agreed that being widely applicable across different areas\nof discourse is only a necessary, not sufficient property of logical\nexpressions; for example, presumably most prepositions are widely\napplicable, but they are not logical expressions on any implicit\ngeneric notion of a logical expression. Attempts to enrich the notion\nof a logical expression have typically sought to provide further\nproperties that collectively amount to necessary and sufficient\nconditions for an expression to be logical.</p>", "<p>\n\nOne idea that has been used in such characterizations, and that is\nalso present in Aristotle, is that logical expressions do not,\nstrictly speaking, signify anything; or, that they do not signify\nanything in the way that substantives, adjectives and verbs signify\nsomething. \u201cLogic [<em>dialektike</em>] is not a science of determined\nthings, or of any one genus\u201d (<em>Posterior Analytics</em>,\n77a32\u20133). We saw that the idea was still present in Kant and the early\nWittgenstein. It reemerged in the Middle Ages. The main sense of the\nword \u201csyncategorematic\u201d as applied to expressions was roughly this\nsemantic sense (see Kretzmann 1982, pp.  212 ff.). Buridan and other\nlate medieval logicians proposed that categorematic expressions\nconstitute the \u201cmatter\u201d of sentences while the syncategorematic\nexpressions constitute their \u201cform\u201d (see the text quoted by\nBoche\u0144ski 1956, \u00a726.11). (In a somewhat different, earlier,\ngrammatical sense of the word, syncategorematic expressions were said\nto be those that cannot be used as subjects or predicates in\ncategorical propositions; see Kretzmann 1982, pp. 211\u20132.) The idea of\nsyncategorematicity is somewhat imprecise, but there are serious\ndoubts that it can serve to characterize the idea of a logical\nexpression, whatever this may be. Most prepositions and adverbs are\npresumably syncategorematic, but they are also presumably non-logical\nexpressions.  Conversely, predicates such as \u201care identical\u201d, \u201cis\nidentical with itself\u201d, \u201cis both identical and not identical with\nitself\u201d, etc., which are resolutely treated as logical in recent\nlogic, are presumably categorematic. (They are of course categorematic\nin the grammatical sense, in which prepositions and adverbs are\nequally clearly syncategorematic.)</p>", "<p>\n\nMost other proposals have tried to delineate in some other way the\nAristotelian idea that the logical expressions have some kind of\n\u201cinsubstantial\u201d meaning, so as to use it as a necessary\nand sufficient condition for logicality. One recent suggestion is that\nlogical expressions are those that do not allow us to distinguish\ndifferent individuals. One way in which this has been made precise is\nthrough the characterization of logical expressions as those whose\nextension or denotation over any particular domain of individuals is\ninvariant under permutations of that domain. (See Tarski and Givant\n1987, p. 57, and Tarski 1966; for related proposals see also McCarthy\n1981, Sher 1991, ch. 3, McGee 1996, Feferman 1999, Bonnay 2008 and Woods 2016,\namong others.)  A permutation of a domain is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the domain and itself. For example, if \\(D\\) is\nthe domain {Aristotle, Caesar, Napoleon, Kripke}, one permutation is\nthe correspondence that assigns each man to himself; another is the\ncorrespondence \\(P\\) that assigns Caesar to Aristotle (in mathematical\nnotation, \\(P(\\text{Aristotle})=\\text{Caesar}\\)), Napoleon to Caesar,\nKripke to Napoleon, and Aristotle to Kripke. That the extension of an\nexpression over a domain is invariant under a permutation of that\ndomain means that the induced image of that extension under the\npermutation is the extension itself (the \u201cinduced image\u201d\nof an extension under a permutation \\(Q\\) is what the extension becomes\nwhen in place of each object \\(o\\) one puts the object \\(Q(o)\\)). The\nextension of \u201cphilosopher\u201d over \\(D\\) is not invariant under\nthe permutation \\(P\\) above, for that extension is \\(\\{\\text{Aristotle},\n\\text{Kripke}\\}\\), whose induced image under \\(P\\) is \\(\\{\\text{Caesar},\n\\text{Aristotle}\\}\\). This is favorable to the proposal, for\n\u201cphilosopher\u201d is certainly not widely applicable, and so\nnon-logical on most views. On the other hand, the predicate \u201care\nidentical\u201d has as its extension over \\(D\\) the set of pairs</p>", "<blockquote>\n\\(\\{ \\langle \\text{Aristotle, Aristotle} \\rangle, \\langle\n\\text{Caesar, Caesar} \\rangle, \\langle \\text{Napoleon, Napoleon}\n\\rangle, \\langle \\text{Kripke, Kripke} \\rangle\\};\\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nits induced image under \\(P\\), and under any other permutation of\n\\(D\\), is that very same set of pairs (as the reader may check); so\nagain this is favorable to the proposal. (Other paradigmatic logical\nexpressions receive more complicated extensions over domains, but the\nextensions they receive are invariant under permutations. For example,\non one usual way of understanding the extension of \u201cand\u201d\nover a domain, this is the function that assigns, to each pair\n\\(\\langle S_1, S_2 \\rangle\\), where \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) are sets of\ninfinite sequences of objects drawn from \\(D\\), the intersection of\n\\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\); and this function is permutation invariant.)  One\nproblem with the proposal is that many expressions that seem clearly\nnon-logical, because they are not widely applicable, are nevertheless\ninvariant under permutations, and thus unable to distinguish different\nindividuals. The simplest examples are perhaps non-logical predicates\nthat have an empty extension over any domain, and hence have empty\ninduced images as well. \u201cMale widow\u201d is one example;\nversions of it can be used as counterexamples to the different\nversions of the idea of logicality as permutation invariance (see\nG\u00f3mez-Torrente 2002), and it's unclear that the proponent of\nthe idea can avoid the problem in any non ad hoc way.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnother popular recent way of delineating the Aristotelian intuition\nof the semantic \u201cinsubstantiality\u201d of logical expressions\nappeals to the concept of \u201cpure inferentiality\u201d. The idea\nis that logical expressions are those whose meaning, in some sense, is\ngiven by \u201cpurely inferential\u201d rules. (See Kneale 1956,\nHacking 1979, Peacocke 1987, Hodes 2004, among others.) A necessary\nproperty of purely inferential rules is that they regulate only\ninferential transitions between verbal items, not between extra-verbal\nassertibility conditions and verbal items, or between verbal items and\nactions licensed by those items. A certain inferential rule licenses\nyou to say \u201cIt rains\u201d when it rains, but it's not\n\u201cpurely inferential\u201d. A rule that licenses you to say\n\u201cA is a female whose husband died before her\u201d when someone\nsays \u201cA is a widow\u201d, however, is not immediately\ndisqualified as purely inferential. Now, presumably in some sense the\nmeaning of \u201cwidow\u201d is given by this last rule together\nperhaps with the converse rule, that licenses you to say \u201cA is a\nwidow\u201d when someone says \u201cA is a female whose husband died\nbefore her\u201d. But \u201cwidow\u201d is not a logical\nexpression, since it's not widely applicable; so one needs to\npostulate more necessary properties that \u201cpurely\ninferential\u201d rules ought to satisfy. A number of such conditions\nare postulated in the relevant literature (see e.g. Belnap 1962 (a\nreply to Prior 1960), Hacking 1979 and Hodes 2004).  However, even\nwhen the notion of pure inferentiality is strengthened in these ways,\nproblems remain.  Most often the proposal is that an expression is\nlogical just in case certain purely inferential rules give its whole\nmeaning, including its sense, or the set of aspects of its use that\nneed to be mastered in order to understand it (as in Kneale 1956,\nPeacocke 1987 and Hodes 2004). However, it seems clear that some\nparadigmatic logical expressions have extra sense attached to them\nthat is not codifiable purely inferentially. For example, inductive\nreasoning involving \u201call\u201d seems to be part of the sense of\nthis expression, but it's hard to see how it could be codified by\npurely inferential rules (as noted by Sainsbury 1991, pp. 316\u20137;\nsee also Dummett 1991, ch. 12). A different version of the proposal\nconsists in saying that an expression is logical just in case certain\npurely inferential rules that are part of its sense suffice to\ndetermine its extension (as in Hacking 1979). But it seems clear that\nif the extension of, say, \u201care identical\u201d is determined by\na certain set of purely inferential rules that are part of its sense,\nthen the extension of \u201care identical and are not male\nwidows\u201d is equally determined by the same rules, which arguably\nform part of its sense; yet \u201care identical and are not male\nwidows\u201d is not a logical expression (see G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n2002).</p>", "<p>\n\nIn view of problems of these and other sorts, some philosophers have\nproposed that the concept of a logical expression is not associated\nwith necessary and sufficient conditions, but only with some necessary\ncondition related to the condition of wide applicability, such as the\ncondition of \u201cbeing very relevant for the systematization of\nscientific reasoning\u201d (see Warmbro\u0304d 1999 for a position of this\ntype). Others (G\u00f3mez-Torrente 2002) have proposed that there\nmay be a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, if these are not\nmuch related to the idea of semantic \u201cinsubstantiality\u201d and are\ninstead pragmatic and suitably vague; for example, many expressions\nare excluded directly by the condition of wide applicability; and\nprepositions are presumably excluded by some such implicit condition\nas \u201ca logical expression must be one whose study is useful for the\nresolution of significant problems and fallacies in reasoning\u201d. To be\nsure, these proposals give up on the extended intuition of semantic\n\u201cinsubstantiality\u201d, and may be somewhat unsatisfactory for that\nreason.</p>", "<p>\n\nSome philosophers have reacted even more radically to the problems of\nusual characterizations, claiming that the distinction between logical\nand non-logical expressions must be vacuous, and thus rejecting the\nnotion of logical form altogether.

One of these is the use of a completely specified set\nof artificial symbols to which the logician unambiguously assigns\nmeanings, related to the meanings of corresponding natural language\nexpressions, but much more clearly delimited and stripped from the\nnotes that in those natural language expressions seem irrelevant to\ntruth-conditional content; this is especially true of symbols meant to\nrepresent the logical expressions of natural language.

Frege himself\nsays, speaking of the higher-order language in his\n\u201cBegriffsschrift\u201d, that through formalization (in the\nthird sense above) \u201cwe arrive at a small number of laws in\nwhich, if we add those contained in the rules, the content of all the\nlaws is included, albeit in an undeveloped state\u201d (Frege 1879,\n\u00a713). The idea follows straightforwardly from Russell's\nconception of mathematics and logic as identical (see Russell 1903,\nch. I, \u00a710; Russell 1920, pp. 194\u20135) and his thesis that\n\u201cby the help of ten principles of deduction and ten other\npremises of a general logical nature (\u2026), all mathematics can\nbe strictly and formally deduced\u201d (Russell 1903, ch.

See also Bernays (1930, p. 239): \u201c[through\nformalization] it becomes evident that all logical inference\n(\u2026) can be reduced to a limited number of logical elementary\nprocesses that can be exactly and completely enumerated\u201d. In the\nopening paragraphs of his paper on logical consequence, Tarski (1936a,\n1936b) says that the belief was prevalent before the appearance of\nG\u00f6del's incompleteness theorems (see subsection 2.4.3 below for\nthe bearing of these theorems on this issue).  In recent times,\napparently due to the influence of Tarskian arguments such as the one\nmentioned towards the end of subsection 2.4.3, the belief in the\nadequacy of derivability characterizations seems to have waned (see\ne.g. Prawitz 1985 for a similar appraisal).</p>", "<p>\n\nEven on the most cautious way of understanding the modality present in\nlogical truths, a sentence is a logical truth only if no sentence\nwhich is a replacement instance of its logical form is false.

A standard\napproach to the mathematical characterization of logical truth,\nalternative to the derivability approach, uses always some version of\nthe property of universal validity, proposing it in each case as both\nnecessary and sufficient for logical truth.

So all universally valid sentences are correct at least\nin this sense.</p>", "<p>\n\nApparently, the first to use a version of universal validity and\nexplicitly propose it as both necessary and sufficient for logical\ntruth was Bolzano (see Bolzano 1837, \u00a7148; and Coffa 1991, pp.\n33\u20134 for the claim of priority). The idea is also present in other\nmathematicians of the nineteenth century (see e.g. Jan\u00e9 2006),\nand was common in Hilbert's school. Tarski (1936a, 1936b) was the\nfirst to indicate in a fully explicit way how the version of universal\nvalidity used by the mathematicians could itself be given a\ncharacterization in terms of concepts of standard mathematics, in the\ncase of Fregean formalized languages with an algorithmic\ngrammar. Essentially Tarski's characterization is widely used today in\nthe form of what is known as the <em>model-theoretic notion of\nvalidity</em>, and it seems fair to say that it is usually accepted\nthat this notion gives a reasonably good delineation of the set of\nlogical truths for Fregean languages.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe notion of model-theoretic validity mimics the notion of universal\nvalidity, but is defined just with the help of the set-theoretic\napparatus developed by Tarski (1935) for the characterization of\nsemantic concepts such as satisfaction, definability, and truth.\n (See the entry on \n  <a href=\"../tarski-truth/\">Tarski's truth definitions</a>.)\n Given a Fregean language, a <em>structure</em> for the language is a\nset-theoretical object composed of a set-domain taken together with an\nassignment of extensions drawn from that domain to its non-logical\nconstants. A structure is meant by most logicians to represent an\nassignment of meanings: its domain gives the range or \u201cmeaning\u201d of the\nfirst-order variables (and induces ranges of the higher-order\nvariables), and the extensions that the structure assigns to the\nnon-logical constants are \u201cmeanings\u201d that these expressions could\ntake. Using the Tarskian apparatus, one defines for the formulae of\nthe Fregean language the notion of truth in (or satisfaction by) a\nset-theoretic structure (with respect to an infinite sequence\nassigning an object of the domain to each variable).  And finally, one\ndefines a formula to be model-theoretically valid just in case it is\ntrue in all structures for its language (with respect to all infinite\nsequences). Let's abbreviate \u201c\\(F\\) is true in all structures\u201d as\n\u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d. The model-theoretic characterization makes it\nclear that \u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d is definable purely in terms of\nconcepts of set theory.

This complaint is especially\ncommon among authors who feel inclined to identify logical truth and\nanalyticity\n<em>simpliciter</em> (see e.g. Kneale and Kneale, <em>ibid</em>.,\nEtchemendy 1990, p. 126). If one thinks of the concept of logical\ntruth simply as the concept of analytic truth, it is especially\nreasonable to accept that the concept of logical truth does not have\nmuch to do with the concept of model-theoretic validity, for\npresumably this concept does not have much to do with the concept of\nanalyticity. To say that a formula is model-theoretically valid means\nthat there are no set-theoretic structures in which it is false;\nhence, to say that a formula is not model-theoretically valid means\nthat there are set-theoretic structures in which it is false. But to\nsay that a sentence is or is not analytic presumably does not mean\nanything about the existence or non-existence of set-theoretic\nstructures. Note that we could object to derivability on the same\ngrounds, for to say that a sentence is or is not analytic presumably\ndoes not mean anything about its being or not being the product of a\ncertain algorithm (compare Etchemendy 1990, p. 3). (One further\npeculiar, much debated claim in Etchemendy 1990 is that true claims of\nthe form \u201c\\(F\\) is logically true\u201d or\n\u201c\\(F\\) is not logically true\u201d should themselves be\nlogical truths (while the corresponding claims\n\u201cMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d and \u201cNot\nMTValid\\((F)\\)\u201d are not logical truths). Etchemendy's claim\nis perhaps defensible under a conception of logical truth as\nanalyticity\n<em>simpliciter</em>, but certainly doubtful on more traditional\nconceptions of logical truth, on which the predicate \u201cis a logical\ntruth\u201d is not even a logical expression. See G\u00f3mez-Torrente\n1998/9 and Soames 1999, ch. 4 for discussion.)</p>", "<p>\n\nAnalogous \u201cno conceptual analysis\u201d objections can be made\nif we accept that the concept of logical truth has some other strong\nmodal notes unrelated to analyticity; for example, if we accept that\nit is part of the concept of logical truth that logical truths are\ntrue in all counterfactual circumstances, or necessary in some other\nstrong sense. Sher (1996) accepts something like the requirement that\na good characterization of logical truth should be given in terms of a\nmodally rich concept. However, she argues that the notion of\nmodel-theoretic validity is strongly modal, and so the \u201cno\nconceptual analysis\u201d objection is actually wrong: to say that a\nformula is or is not model-theoretically valid is to make a\nmathematical existence or non-existence claim, and according to Sher\nthese claims are best read as claims about the possibility and\nnecessity of structures. (Shalkowski 2004 argues that Sher's defense\nof model-theoretic validity is insufficient, on the basis of a certain\nmetaphysical conception of logical necessity. Etchemendy 2008\nrelatedly argues that Sher's defense is based on inadequate\nrestrictions on the modality relevant to logical truth. See also the\ncritical discussion of Sher in Hanson 1997.)  Garc\u00eda-Carpintero\n(1993) offers a view related to Sher's: model-theoretic validity\nprovides a (correct) conceptual analysis of logical truth for Fregean\nlanguages, because the notion of a set-theoretical structure is in\nfact a subtle refinement of the modal notion of a possible meaning\nassignment. Azzouni (2006), ch. 9, also defends the view that\nmodel-theoretic validity provides a correct conceptual analysis of\nlogical truth (though restricted to first-order languages), on the\nbasis of a certain deflationist conception of the (strong) modality\ninvolved in logical truth.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe standard view of set-theoretic claims, however, does not see them\nas strong modal claims\u2014at best, some of them are modal in the\nminimal sense that they are universal generalizations or particular\ncases of these. But it is at any rate unclear that this is the basis\nfor a powerful objection to model-theoretic validity or to\nderivability, for, even if we accept that the concept of logical truth\nis strongly modal, it is unclear that a good characterization of\nlogical truth ought to be a conceptual analysis. An analogy might\nhelp.  It is widely agreed that the characterizations of the notion of\ncomputability in standard mathematics, e.g. as recursiveness, are in\nsome sense good characterizations. Note that the concept of\ncomput<em>ability</em> is modal, in a moderately strong sense; it\nseems to be about what a being like us could do with certain symbols\nif he were free from certain limitations\u2014not about, say, what\nexisting beings have done or will do. However, to say that a certain\nfunction is recursive is not to make a modal claim about it, but a\ncertain purely arithmetical claim. So recursiveness is widely agreed\nto provide a good characterization of computability, but it clearly\ndoes not provide a conceptual analysis. Perhaps it could be argued\nthat the situation with model-theoretic validity, or derivability, or\nboth, is the same.</p>", "<p>\n\nA number of philosophers explicitly reject the requirement that a good\ncharacterization of logical truth should provide a conceptual\nanalysis, and (at least for the sake of argument) do not question the\nusual view of set-theoretic claims as non-modal, but have argued that\nthe universe of set-theoretic structures somehow models the universe\nof possible structures (or at least the universe of possible\nset-theoretic structures; see McGee 1992, Shapiro 1998, Sagi 2014). In this\nindirect sense, the characterization in terms of model-theoretic\nvalidity would grasp part of the strong modal force that logical\ntruths are often perceived to possess. McGee (1992) gives an elegant\nargument for this idea: it is reasonable to think that given any\nset-theoretic structure, even one construed out of non-mathematical\nindividuals, actualized or not, there is a set-theoretic structure\nisomorphic to it but construed exclusively out of pure sets; but any\nsuch pure set-theoretic structure is, on the usual view, an actualized\nexistent; so every possible set-theoretic structure is modeled by a\nset-theoretic structure, as desired.

One idea is that the results of\n<em>a priori</em> reasoning or of analytic thinking ought to be\ncodifiable in a calculus. (See e.g. Wagner 1987, p. 8.) But even if we\ngrant this idea, it's doubtful that the desired conclusion follows.\nSuppose that (i) every <em>a priori</em> or analytic reasoning must be\nreproducible in a calculus. We accept also, of course, that (ii)\n<em>for every</em> calculus \\(C\\) sound with respect to\nmodel-theoretic validity <em>there is</em> a\nmodel-theoretically valid formula that is not derivable in\n\\(C\\).

From (i) and (ii) it doesn't follow that\nthere is any model-theoretically valid formula which is not obtainable\nby <em>a priori</em> or analytic reasoning. The only thing that\nfollows (from (ii) alone under the assumptions that model-theoretic\nvalidity is sound with respect to logical truth and that logical\ntruths are <em>a priori</em> and analytic) is that no calculus sound\nwith respect to model-theoretic validity can by itself model\n<em>all</em> the <em>a priori</em> or analytic reasonings\nthat people are able to make. But it's not sufficiently clear that\nthis should be intrinsically problematic. After all, <em>a priori</em>\nand analytic reasonings must start from basic axioms and rules, and\nfor all we know a reflective mind may have an inexhaustible ability to\nfind new truths and truth-preserving rules by <em>a priori</em> or\nanalytic consideration of even a meager stock of concepts.

On these assumptions it is certainly very\nreasonable to think that derivability, in any calculus satisfying (4),\nmust be incomplete with respect to logical truth. But in the absence\nof additional considerations, a critic may question the assumptions,\nand deny relevance to the argument. The second assumption would\nprobably be questioned e.g. from the point of view that logical truths\nmust be analytic, for there is no conclusive reason to think that\nuniversally valid formulae must be analytic. The first assumption\nactually underlies any conviction one may have that (4) holds for any\none particular higher-order calculus.  (Note that if we denied that\nthe higher-order quantifiers are logical expressions we could equally\ndeny that the arguments presented above against the soundness of\nmodel-theoretic validity with respect to <em>logical truth</em> are\nrelevant at all.)

By\n\u201cvery big\u201d, I believe he means both that the aesthetic\ndimension weaves itself through all of philosophy in the manner\nsuggested above, and that the reach of the <em>aesthetic</em> in human\naffairs is very much greater than the far more restricted reach of the\n<em>artistic</em>; the world is densely packed with manifestations of\nthe aesthetic sense or aesthetic interest, while the number of works of\nart is very much smaller. There is good reason, in his discussions that\nfollow, to believe that he intends that any comprehensive account of\nthe aesthetic would acknowledge the former, and not just \u2013 as a\ngood number of philosophical accounts have so restricted themselves\n\u2013 the latter. By \u201centirely misunderstood\u201d, it\nemerges that he means both (1) that aesthetic questions are of a\nconceptual type <em>very</em> distinct from empirical questions and the\nkind of answer, or conceptual satisfaction, we want is very unlike what\nwe might get from an experiment in empirical psychology, and (2) that\nthe philosophically traditional method of essentialistic definition\n\u2013 determining the essence that all members of the class\n\u201cworks of art\u201d exhibit and by virtue of which they are so\nclassified \u2013 will conceal from our view more than it\nreveals.\u00a0</p>", "<p>\n\nIt is also vividly apparent from the outset of these lectures that\nWittgenstein is urging a heightened vigilance to the myriad ways in\nwhich words can, on their grammatical surface, mislead. If, right at\nthe beginning of the inquiry, we see that we use the word\n\u201cbeautiful\u201d as an adjective, we may well very shortly find\nourselves asking what is the essence of the <em>property</em> beauty\nthat this particular example exhibits. Imagining a book of philosophy\ninvestigating parts of speech (but very many more parts than we find\nin an ordinary grammar book) where we would give very detailed and\nnuanced attention to \u201cseeing\u201d, \u201cfeeling\u201d,\nalong with other verbs of personal experience, and equally lengthy\nstudies of \u201call\u201d, \u201cany\u201d, \u201csome\u201d,\nnumerals, first person pronoun usages, and so forth, he suggests that\nsuch a book would, with sufficient attention paid to the contextual\nintricacies of the grammar of each usage, lay bare the confusion into\nwhich language can lead us. Later, in his <em>Philosophical\nInvestigations</em> (Wittgenstein 1958), he will go on to famously\ndevelop the analogy between tools and language as a way of breaking\nthe hold of the conceptual picture that words work in one way (by\nnaming things\u2014including the naming of properties, as in the way\nwe too-quickly think of the problem of beauty above), showing the\ndiversity of <em>kind</em> and of <em>use</em> among the various\nthings we find in the tool box (e.g. hammer, glue, chisel,\nmatches). If we redirect our attention, away from the <em>id\u00e9e\nfixe</em> of the puzzle concerning the common property named by the\nword \u201cbeauty\u201d or the description \u201cbeautiful\u201d,\nand look to the actual use to which our aesthetic-critical vocabulary\nis put, we will see that it is not some intrinsic meaning carried\ninternally by the linguistic sign (Wittgenstein 1958a) that makes the\nword in question function as an aesthetic or critical interjection or\nexpression of approval. We will, rather, be able to focus our\nredirected attention on what actually does make the word in question\nfunction aesthetically, i.e. \u201con the enormously complicated\nsituation in which the aesthetic expression has a place\u201d, and he\nadds that, with such an enlarged vision, we see that \u201cthe\nexpression itself has almost a negligible place\u201d (p. 2). He here\nmentions (seeing aesthetic issues as interwoven with the rest of\nphilosophy) that if he had to identify the main mistake made in\nphilosophical work of his generation, it would be precisely that of,\nwhen looking at language, focusing on the form of words, and not the\nuse made of the form of words. He will go on to imply, if not quite to\ndirectly assert, that the parallel holds to the work of art: to see it\nwithin a larger frame of reference, to see it in comparison to other\nworks of the artist in question and to see it juxtaposed with still\nother works from its cultural context, is to see what role itplayed in\nthe dialogically unfolding artistic\n \u201clanguage-game\u201d<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#1\" name=\"note-1\">1</a>]</sup>\n of its time and place. In using language, he says next in the\nlectures, in understanding each other\u2014and in mastering a\nlanguage initially\u2014we do not start with a small set of words or\na single word, but rather from specific occasions and activities. Our\naesthetic engagements are occasions and activities of just this kind;\nthus aesthetics, as a field of conceptual inquiry, should start not\nfrom a presumption that the central task is to analyze the determinant\nproperties that are named by aesthetic predicates, but rather with a\nfull-blooded consideration of the <em>activities</em> of aesthetic\nlife.</p>", "<p>\n\nBut the adjectival form of many\u2014not all\u2014critical\npredicates quickly reinforces the \u201cproperty-with-name\u201d\nmodel, and against this Wittgenstein places examples from musical and\npoetical criticism, where we simply call attention to the rightness of\na transition or to the precision or aptness of an image. And it is\nhere that Wittgenstein reminds us that descriptions such as\n\u201cstately\u201d, \u201cpompous\u201d, or\n\u201cmelancholy\u201d (where the latter is said of a Schubert\npiece) are like giving the work a face (Shiner 1978), or we could\ninstead (or in further specification of such descriptions) use\n gestures.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#2\" name=\"note-2\">2</a>]</sup>\n In cases of re-construing a work (e.g. the meter of a poem) so that\nwe understand its rhythm and structure anew, we make gestures, facial\nexpressions, and non-descriptive-predicate based remarks, where\naesthetic adjectives play a diminished role or no role at all. And we\nshow our approval of a tailor's work not by describing the suit, but\nby wearing it. Occasions and activities are fundamental, descriptive\nlanguage secondary.</p>", "<p>\n\nWittgenstein here turns to the subject of rules, and rule-following,\nin aesthetic decision-making. This stems from his reflection on the\nword \u201ccorrect\u201d in aesthetic discourse, and he mentions the\ncase of being drilled in harmony and counterpoint. Such rule-learning,\nhe claims, allows what he calls an interpretation of the rules in\nparticular cases, where an increasingly refined judgment comes from an\nincreasingly refined mastery of the rules in question. It is of\nparticular interest that a qualification is entered here, that such\nrules in contexts of artistic creativity and aesthetic judgment,\n\u201cmay be extremely explicit and taught, or not formulated at\nall\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966).  This itself strongly suggests that,\nin this way too, <em>actions</em> come first, where these actions may\n(to invoke Kant's famous distinction) either explicitly follow from\nthe rule, or stand in accordance with them but (for Wittgenstein) in\nan inexplicit way. The mastery of a practice can be, but need not be,\ncharacterized as a cognitive matter of rule-following. Here we thus\nfind one of the points of intersection between Wittgenstein's\nwork in aesthetics and his work in the philosophy of language: the\nrule-following considerations (Holtzman and Leich 1981 and McDowell\n1998) and the debate concerning non-cognitivism (McDowell 2000) link\ndirectly to this discussion.</p>", "<p>\n\nRegrettably, Wittgenstein closes this matter prematurely (claiming\nthat this issue should not come in at this point); the linkage between\nrule-following in language and in aesthetics is still to this day too\nlittle investigated. Yet there is a sense in which Wittgenstein\nextends the discussion, if only implicitly. In investigating the kinds\nof things meant by aesthetic \u201cappreciation\u201d, he does say\nthat \u201can appreciator is not shown by the interjections he\nuses\u201d but rather by his choices, selections, his actions on\nspecific occasions. To describe what appreciation consists in, he\nclaims, would prove an impossibility, for \u201cto describe what it\nconsists in we would have to describe the whole environment\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 7), and he returns to the case of the\ntailor\u2014and thus implicitly to rule-following. Such rules, as we\ndiscern them in action ranging on a continuum from the\ncognitively-explicit and linguistically encapsulated to the\nnon-cognitively implicit and only behaviorally manifested, have a life\n\u2013 have an identity as rules\u2014within, and <em>only</em>\nwithin, those larger contexts of engagement, those \u201cwhole\nenvironment[s]\u201d. And those environments, those contexts, those\nlanguage-games, are not reducible to a unitary kind which we then\nmight analyze for essential properties: \u201ccorrectness\u201d, for\nexample, plays a central role in some cases of aesthetic appreciation\nand understanding, and it is irrelevant in others, e.g. in\ngarment-cutting versus Beethoven symphonies, or in domestic\narchitecture versus the Gothic cathedral. And he explicitly draws, if\ntoo briefly, the analogy that emerges here between ethics and\naesthetics: he notes the difference between saying of a person that he\nbehaves well versus saying that a person made a great or profound\nimpression. Indeed, \u201cthe entire\n<em>game</em> is different\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 8).</p>", "<p>\n\nThe central virtue of these lectures is that Wittgenstein never loses\na sense of the <em>complexity</em> of our aesthetic engagements, our\nlanguage attending and in cases manifesting those engagements, and the\ncontextually embedded nature of the aesthetic actions he is working to\nelucidate. Nor does he lose a sense of the relation\u2014a relation\nnecessary to the meaning of the aesthetic language we use \u2013\nbetween the aesthetically-descriptive expressions we employ within\nparticular contexts and \u201cwhat we call the culture of the\nperiod\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 8).  Of those aesthetic words, he\nsays, \u201cTo describe their use or to describe what you mean by a\ncultured taste, you have to describe a culture\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1966, 8).  And again making the relation between his work in the\nphilosophy of language and his work in the philosophy of art explicit\n(if again too briefly), he adds, \u201cWhat belongs to a language\ngame is a whole culture\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 8). There the link\nto the irreducible character of rule-following is made again as well:\n\u201cTo describe a set of aesthetic rules fully means really to\ndescribe the culture of a period\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 8, n. 3).\nIf our aesthetic engagements and the interrelated uses of our\naesthetic terms are widely divergent and context-sensitive, so are our\naesthetic actions and vocabularies context-sensitive in a larger sense\nas well: comparing a cultured taste of <em>fin-de-siecle</em> Vienna\nor early-twentieth-century Cambridge with the Middle Ages, he\nsays\u2014implicitly referring to the radically divergent\nconstellations of meaning-associations from one age to the other,\n\u201cAn entirely different game is played in different ages\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, p. 8).  Of a generic claim made about a person\nthat he or she appreciates a given style or genre of art, Wittgenstein\nmakes it clear that he would not yet know\u2014stated in that\ngeneric, case-transcending way\u2014not merely whether it was true or\nnot, but more interestingly and more deeply, what it <em>meant</em> to\nsay this. The word \u201cappreciates\u201d is, like the rest of our\naesthetic vocabulary, not detachable from the\n particular context within which it has its\n life.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#3\" name=\"note-3\">3</a>]</sup>\n If, against this diversity or context-sensitivity, we seek to find\nand then analyze what all such cases of aesthetic engagement have in\ncommon, we might well focus on the <em>word</em>\n\u201cappreciation\u201d. But that word will not have meaning with a\nbounded determinacy fixed prior to its contextualized use, which means\nthat we would find ourselves, because of this philosophical strategy\n(the entire field \u201cis very big and entirely\nmisunderstood\u201d), in a double bind: first, we would not know the\nmeaning of the term upon which we were focusing; and second, we would,\nin trying to locate what all cases of aesthetic engagement have in\ncommon, leave out of view what he calls in this connection \u201can\nimmensely complicated family of cases\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966),\nblinding ourselves to nuance and complexity in the name of a\nfalsifying neatness and overarching generality. \u201cIn order to get\nclear about aesthetic words you have to describe ways of living. We\nthink we have to talk about aesthetic judgments like \u2018This is\nbeautiful\u2019, but we find that if we have to talk about aesthetic\njudgments we don't find these words at all, but a word used\nsomething like a gesture, accompanying a complicated\n activity\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 11).</p>", "<p>\n\nWittgenstein turns to the idea of a science of aesthetics, an idea for\nwhich he has precious little sympathy (\u201calmost too ridiculous\nfor words\u201d [Wittgenstein 1966, 11]).  But as is often the case\nin Wittgenstein's philosophical work, it does not follow from\nthis scornful or dismissive attitude that he has no interest in the\netiology of the idea, or in excavating the hidden steps or components\nof thought that have led some to this idea. In the ensuing discussion\nhe unearths a picture of causation that under-girds the very idea of a\nscientific explanation of aesthetic judgment or preference. And in\nworking underground in this way, he reveals the analogies to cases of\ngenuine scientific explanation, where the \u201ctracing of a\nmechanism\u201d just is the process of giving a causal account, i.e.\nwhere the observed effect is described as the inevitable result of\nprior links in the causal chain leading to it. If, to take his\nexample, an architect designs a door and we find ourselves in a state\nof discontentment because the door, within the larger design of the\nfa\u00e7ade (within its stylistic \u201clanguage-game\u201d, we\nmight say), is too low, we are liable to describe this on the model of\nscientific explanation. Then, we make a substantive of the discontent,\nsee it as the causal result of the lowness of the door, and in\nidentifying the lowness as the cause, think ourselves able to dislodge\nthe inner entity, the discontent, by raising the door. But this\nmischaracterizes our aesthetic reactions, or what we might call, by\nanalogy to moral psychology, our aesthetic psychology.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe true aesthetic reaction\u2014itself rarely described <em>in\nsitu</em> in terms of a proximate cause (\u201cIn these cases the\nword \u2018cause\u2019 is hardly ever used at all\u201d\n[Wittgenstein 1966, 14]) is far more immediate, and far more\nintertwined with, and related to, what we see\n in<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#4\" name=\"note-4\">4</a>]</sup>\n the work of art in question. \u201cIt is a reaction analogous to my\ntaking my hand away from a hot plate\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966).  He\nthus says:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\nTo say: \u201cI feel discomfort and know the cause\u201d, is\nentirely misleading because \u201cknow the cause\u201d normally\nmeans something quite different. How misleading it is depends on\nwhether when you said: \u201cI know the cause\u201d, you meant it to\nbe an explanation or not. \u201cI feel discomfort and know the\ncause\u201d makes it sound as if there were two things going on in my\nsoul\u2014discomfort and knowing the cause (Wittgenstein 1966,\n14).\n\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nBut there is, as he next says, a \u201cWhy?\u201d to such a case of\naesthetic discomfort, if not a cause (on the conventional scientific\nmodel). But both the question and its multiform answers will take,\nindeed, very different forms in different cases. Again, if what he\nsuggested before concerning the significance of context for meaning is\nright, the very <em>meaning</em> of the \u201cWhy?\u201d-question\nwill vary case to case. This is not a weaker thesis concerning\nvariation on the level of inflection, where the underlying structure\nof the \u201cWhy?\u201d-question is causal. No, here again that\nunifying, model-imposing manner of proceeding would leave out a\nconsideration of the nuances that give the \u201cWhy?\u201d-question\nits determinate sense in the first place.</p>", "<p>\n\n But again, Wittgenstein's fundamental concern here is to point out\nthe great conceptual gulf that separates aesthetic perplexities from\nthe methodology of empirical psychology. To run studies of quantified\nresponses to controlled and isolated aesthetic stimuli, where emergent\npatterns of preference, response, and judgment are recorded within a\ngiven population's sample, is to pass by the true character of the\naesthetic issue\u2014the actual puzzlement, such as we feel it, will\nbe conceptual, not empirical. And here again we see a direct link to\nhis work in the philosophy of psychology: the penultimate passage of\nPart II of <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> (1958, sec. xiv), was\n\u201cThe existence of the experimental method makes us think we have\nthe means of solving the problems which trouble us; though problem and\nmethod pass one another by\u201d (Wittgenstein 1958, II, iv, 232).\nHe says, near the close of this part of his lectures on aesthetics,\n\u201cAesthetic questions have nothing to do with psychological\nexperiments, but are answered in an entirely different way\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 17).  A stimulus-response model adapted from\nscientific psychology\u2014what we might now call the naturalizing of\naesthetics\u2014falsifies the genuine complexities of aesthetic\npsychology through a methodologically enforced reduction to one narrow\nand unitary conception of aesthetic engagement. For Wittgenstein\ncomplexity, and not reduction to unitary essence, is the route to\nconceptual clarification. Reduction to a simplified model, by\ncontrast, yields only the illusion of clarification in the form of\nconceptual incarceration (\u201ca picture held us\n captive\u201d).<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#5\" name=\"note-5\">5</a>]</sup></p>", "<p>\n\nAesthetic satisfaction, for Wittgenstein, is an experience that is\nonly possible within a culture and where the reaction that constitutes\naesthetic satisfaction or justification is both more immediate, and\nvastly larger and more expansive, than any simple mechanistic account\ncould accommodate. It is more immediate in that it is not usually\npossible to specify in advance the exact conditions required to\nproduce the satisfaction, or, as he discusses it, the\n\u201cclick\u201d when everything falls into place. Such exacting\npre-specifications for satisfaction are possible in narrowly\nrestricted empirical cases where, for example, we wait for two\npointers in a vision examination to come into a position directly\nopposite each other. And this, Wittgenstein says, is the kind of\nsimile we repeatedly use, but misleadingly, for in truth \u201creally\nthere is nothing that clicks or that fits anything\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 19). The satisfaction is more immediate, then,\nthan the causal-mechanistic model would imply. And it is much broader\nthan the causal-mechanistic model implies as well: there is no direct\naesthetic analogue to the matched pointers in the case of a larger and\ndeeper form of aesthetic gratification. Wittgenstein does, of course,\nallow that there are very narrow, isolated circumstances within a work\nwhere we do indeed have such empirical pre-specifiable conditions for\nsatisfaction (e.g. where in a piece we see that we wanted to hear a\nminor ninth, and not a minor seventh, chord). But, contrary to the\nempirical-causal account, these will not add up, exhaustively or\nwithout remainder, to the experience of aesthetic satisfaction. The\nproblem, to which Wittgenstein repeatedly returns in these lectures,\nis with the <em>kind</em> of answer we want to aesthetic puzzlement as\nexpressed in a question like \u201cWhy do these bars give me such a\npeculiar impression?\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 20) In such cases,\nstatistical results regarding percentages of subjects who report this\npeculiar impression rather than another one in precisely these\nharmonic, rhythmic, and melodic circumstances are not so much\nimpossible as just beside the point; the <em>kind</em> of question we\nhave here is not met by such methods. \u201cThe sort of explanation\none is looking for when one is puzzled by an aesthetic impression is\nnot a causal explanation, not one corroborated by experience or by\nstatistics as to how people react\u2026. This is not what one means\nor what one is driving at by an investigation into aesthetics\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 21). It is all too easy to falsify, under the\ninfluence of explanatory models misappropriated from science, the many\nand varied kinds of things that happen when, aesthetically speaking,\neverything seems to click or fall into place.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn the next passages of Wittgenstein's lectures he turns to a fairly\ndetailed examination of the distinct charm, for some, of\npsycho-analytic explanation, and he interweaves this with the\ndistinction between scientific-causal explanation of an action versus\nmotive-based (or personally-generated) explanations of that action. It\nis easy, but mistaken, to read these passages as simply\nsubject-switching anticipations of his lectures on Freud to\nfollow. His fundamental interest here lies with the powerful charm, a\nkind of conceptual magnetism, of reductive explanations that promise a\nbrief, compact, and propositionally-encapsulated account of what some\nmuch larger field of thought or action \u201creally\u201d is. (He\ncites the example of boiling Redpath, one of his auditors, down to\nashes, etc., and then saying \u201cThis is all Redpath really\nis\u201d, adding the remark \u201cSaying this might have a certain\ncharm, but would be misleading to say the least\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1966, 24).  \u201cTo say the least\u201d indeed: the example is\nstriking precisely because one can feel the attraction of an\nencapsulating and simplifying reduction of the bewildering and\nmonumental complexity of a human being, while at the same time\nfeeling, as a human being, that any such reduction to a few physical\nelements would hardly capture the essence of a person.  This, he\nobserves, is an explanation of the \u201cThis is only really\nthis\u201d form. Reductive causal explanations function in just the\nsame way in aesthetics, and this links directly to the problems in\nphilosophical methodology that he adumbrated in the <em>Blue and Brown\nBooks</em> (1958a, 17\u201319), particularly where he discusses what\nhe there calls \u201ccraving for generality\u201d and the attendant\n\u201ccontemptuous attitude toward the particular case\u201d. If the\nparadigm of the sciences (which themselves, as he observes in passing,\ncarry an imprimatur of epistemic prestige and the image of\nincontrovertibility) is Newtonian mechanics, and we then implant that\nmodel under our subsequent thinking about psychology, we will almost\nimmediately arrive at an idea of a science of the mind, where that\nscience would progress through the gradual accumulation of\npsychological laws. (This would constitute, as he memorably puts it, a\n\u201cmechanics of the soul\u201d [Wittgenstein 1966, 29]). We then\ndream of a psychological science of aesthetics, where\u2014although\n\u201cwe'd not thereby have solved what we feel to be aesthetic\npuzzlement\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 29)\u2014we may find ourselves\nable to predict (borrowing the criterion of predictive power from\nscience) what effect a given line of poetry, or a given musical\nphrase, may have on a certain person whose reaction patterns we have\nstudied. But aesthetic puzzlement, again, is of a different\n<em>kind</em>, and\u2014here he takes a major step forward, from the\ncritical, to the constructive, phase of his lectures. He writes,\n\u201cWhat we really want, to solve aesthetic puzzlements, is certain\ncomparisons\u2014grouping together of certain cases\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 29).  Such a method, such an approach, would never\nso much as occur to us were we to remain both dazzled by the\nmisappropriated model of mechanics and contemptuous of the particular\ncase.</p>", "<p>\n\nComparison, and the intricate process of grouping together certain\ncases\u2014where such comparative juxtaposition usually casts certain\nsignificant features of the work or works in question in higher\nrelief, where it leads to the emergence of an organizational\n gestalt,<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#6\" name=\"note-6\">6</a>]</sup>\n where it shows the evolution of a style, or where it shows what is\nstrikingly original about a work, among many other things\u2014also\nfocuses our attention on the particular case in another way. In\nleading our scrutiny to critically and interpretatively relevant\nparticularities, it leads us away from the aesthetically blinding\npresumption that it is the <em>effect</em>, brought about by the\n\u201ccause\u201d of that particular work, that matters (so that any\nminuet that gives a certain feeling or awakens certain images would do\nas well as any other).</p>", "<p>\n\nThese foregoing matters together lead to what is to my mind central to\nWittgenstein's thoughts on aesthetics. In observing that on one\nhearing of a minuet we may get a lot out of it and on the next hearing\nnothing, he is showing how easy it can be to take conceptual missteps\nin our aesthetic thought from which it can prove difficult to\nrecover. From such a difference, against how we can all too easily\nmodel the matter, it does not follow that what we get out of the\nminuet is <em>independent</em> of the minuet. That would constitute an\nimposition of a Cartesian dualism between the two ontologies of mind\nand matter, but in its aesthetic guise. And that would lead in turn to\ntheories of aesthetic content of a mental kind, where the materials of\nthe art form (materials we would then call \u201cexternal\u201d\nmaterials) only serve to carry the real, internal or non-physical\ncontent. Criticism would thus be a process of arguing inferentially\nfrom outward evidence back to inward content; creation would be a\nprocess of finding outward correlates or carriers for that prior\ninward content; and artistic intention would be articulated as a full\nmental pre-conception of the contingently finished (or\n\u201cexternalized\u201d, as we would then call it) work. It is no\naccident that Wittgenstein immediately moves to the analogy to\nlanguage and our all-too-easy misconception of linguistic meaning,\nwhere we make \u201cthe mistake of thinking that the meaning or\nthought is just an accompaniment of the word, and the word doesn't\nmatter\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 25). This indeed would prove\nsufficient to motivate contempt for the particular case in aesthetic\nconsiderations, by misleadingly modeling a dualistic vision of art\nupon an equally misleading dualistic model of language (Hagberg\n1995). \u201cThe sense of a proposition\u201d, he says, \u201cis\nvery similar to the business of an appreciation of art\u201d\n(Wittgenstein 1966, 29). This might also be called a subtractive\nmodel, and Wittgenstein captures this perfectly with a question:\n\u201cA man may sing a song with expression and without\nexpression. Then why not leave out the song\u2014could you have the\nexpression then?\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 32 editorial note and\nfootnote) Such a model corresponds, again, to mind-matter Cartesian\ndualism, which is a conceptual template that also, as we have just\nseen above, manifests itself in the philosophy of language where we\nwould picture the thought as an inner event and the external word or\nsign to which it is arbitrarily attached as that inner event's\noutward corresponding physicalization. It is no surprise that, in this\nlecture, he turns directly to false and imprisoning pictures of this\ndualism in linguistic meaning, and then back to the aesthetic\ncase. When we contemplate the expression of a drawn face, it is deeply\nmisleading\u2014or deeply misled, if the dualistic picture of\nlanguage stands behind this template-conforming thought\u2014to ask\nfor the expression to be given without the face. \u201cThe\nexpression\u201d\u2014now linking this discussion back to the\nprevious causal considerations\u2014\u201cis not an <em>effect</em>\nof the face\u201d. The template of cause-and-effect, and of a dualism\nof material and expressive content (on the subtractive model), and the\nconstrual of the material work of art as a <em>means</em> to the\nproduction of a separately-identifiable intangible, experiential\n<em>end,</em> are all out of place here. All of the examples\nWittgenstein gives throughout these lectures combat these pictures,\neach in their own way.</p>", "<p>\n\nBut then Wittgenstein's examples also work in concert: they\ntogether argue against a form of aesthetic reductionism that would\npretend that our reactions to aesthetic objects are isolable, that they\ncan be isolated as variables within a controlled experiment, that they\ncan be hermetically sealed as the experienced effects of isolatable\ncauses. He discusses our aesthetic reactions to subtle\ndifferences between differently drawn faces, and our equally subtle\nreactions to the height or design of a door (he is known to have had\nthe ceiling in an entire room of the house in Vienna he designed for\nhis sister moved only a few inches when the builders failed to realize\nhis plan with sufficient exactitude). The enormous subtlety, and the\nenormous complexity, of these reactions, are a part of\u2014and as\ncomplicated as\u2014our natural history. He gives as an example the\nerror, or the crudeness, of someone responding to a complaint\nconcerning the depiction of a human smile (specifically, that the smile\ndid not seem genuine), with the reply that, after all, the lips are\nonly parted one one-thousandths of an inch too much: such differences,\nhowever small in <em>measure</em>, in truth matter enormously.</p>", "<p>\n\nBeneath Wittgenstein's examples, as developed throughout these\nlectures, lies another interest (which presses its way to the surface\nand becomes explicit on occasion): he is eager to show the\nsignificance of making connections in our perception and understanding\nof art works\u2014connections between the style of a poet and that of\na composer (e.g. Keller and Brahms), between one musical theme and\nanother, between one expressive facial depiction and another, between\none period of an artist's work and another. Such connections\u2014we\nmight, reviving a term from first-generation Wittgensteinians, refer\nto the kind of work undertaken to identify and articulate such\nconnections as \u201cconnective analysis\u201d\u2014are, for\nWittgenstein, at the heart of aesthetic experience and aesthetic\ncontemplation. And they again are of the kind that reductive causal\nexplanation would systematically miss. In attempting to describe\nsomeone's feelings, could we do better than to imitate the way the\nperson actually said the phrase we found emotionally revelatory,\nWittgenstein pointedly asks? The disorientation we would feel in\ntrying to describe the person's feeling with subtlety and precision\n<em>without</em> any possibility of imitating his precise expressive\nutterance\u2014\u201cthe way he said it\u201d \u2013 shows how\nvery far the dualistic or subtractive conceptual template is from our\nhuman experience, our natural history.</p>", "<p>\n\nConnections, of the kind alluded to here\u2014a web of\nvariously-activated relations between the particular aspect of the\nwork to which we are presently attending and other aspects, other\nparts of the work, or other works, groups of works, or other artists,\ngenres, styles, or other human experiences in all their\nparticularity\u2014may include what we call associations awakened by\nthe work, but connections are not reducible to them only (and\ncertainly not to undisciplined, random, highly subjective, or free\n associations).<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#7\" name=\"note-7\">7</a>]</sup>\n The impossibility of the simplifying subtractive template emerges\nhere as well: \u201cSuppose [someone says]: \u2018Associations are\nwhat matter\u2014change it slightly and it no longer has the same\nassociations\u2019. But can you separate the associations from the\npicture, and have the same thing?\u201d The answer is clearly, again\nlike the case of the singing with and then without expression above,\nnegative: \u201cYou can't say: \u2018That's just as good as the\nother: it gives me the same associations\u2019\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1966, 34). Here again, Wittgenstein shows the great gulf that\nseparates what we actually do with, what we actually say about, works\nof art, and how we would speak of them <em>if</em> the conceptual\npictures and templates with which he has been doing battle were\ncorrect. To extend one of Wittgenstein's examples, we would very\nmuch doubt the aesthetic discernment, and indeed the sympathetic\nimagination and the human connectedness, of a person who said of two\npoems (each of which reminded him of death) that either will do as\nwell as the other to a bereaved friend, that they would do the same\nthing (where this is uttered in a manner dismissive of nuance, or as\nthough it is being said of two detergents). Poetry, Wittgenstein is\nshowing, does not play that kind of role in our lives, as the nature\nand character of our critical verbal interactions about it\nindicate. And he ascends, momentarily, to a remark that characterizes\nhis underlying philosophical methodology (or one dimension of it) in\nthe philosophy of language that is being put to use here within the\ncontext of his lectures on aesthetics: \u201cIf someone talks bosh,\nimagine the case in which it is not bosh. The moment you imagine it,\nyou see at once it is not like that in our case\u201d (Wittgenstein\n1966, 34). The gulf that separates what we should say if the\ngeneralizing templates were accurate from what we in actual\nparticularized cases do say could further call into question not only\nthe applicability or accuracy, but indeed the very intelligibility, of\nthe language used to express those templates, those explanatory\npictures. Wittgenstein leaves that more aggressive, and ultimately\nmore clarifying and conceptually liberating, critique for his work on\nlanguage and mind in <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> (1958) and\nother writings, but one can see from these lectures alone how such an\naggressive critique might be undertaken.</p>", "<p>\n\nNear the end of his lectures Wittgenstein turns to the question of the\nattitude we take toward the work of art. He employs the case of seeing\nthe very slight change (of the kind mentioned above) in the depiction\nof a smile within a picture of a monk looking at a vision of the\nVirgin Mary. Where the slight and subtle change of line yields a\ntransformation of the smile of the monk from a kindly to an ironic\none, our attitude in viewing might similarly change from one in which\nfor some we are almost in prayer to one that would for some be\nblasphemous, where we are almost leering. He then gives voice to his\nimagined reductive interlocutor, who says, \u201cWell there you\nare. It is all in the attitude\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 35), where\nwe would then focus, to the exclusion of all of the rest of the\nintricate, layered, and complex human dimensions of our reactions to\nworks, solely on an analysis of the attitude of the spectator and the\nisolable causal elements in the work that determine it. But that,\nagain, is only to give voice to a reductive impulse, and in the brief\nensuing discussion he shows, once again, that in some cases, an\nattitude of this kind may emerge as particularly salient. But in other\ncases, not. And he shows, here intertwining a number of his themes\nfrom these lectures, that the very idea of \u201ca description of an\nattitude\u201d is itself no simple thing. Full-blooded human beings,\nand not stimulus-response-governed automata, have aesthetic\nexperience, and that experience is as complex a part of our natural\nhistory as any other.</p>", "<p>\n\nWittgenstein ends the lectures discussing a simple heading: \u201cthe\ncraving for simplicity\u201d (Wittgenstein 1966, 36). To such a mind,\nhe says, if an explanation is complicated, it is disagreeable for that\nvery reason. A certain kind of mind will insist on seeking out the\nsingle, unitary essence of the matter, where\u2014much like Russell's\natomistic search for the essence of the logic of language beneath what\nhe regarded as its misleadingly and distractingly variegated\nsurface\u2014the reductive impulse would be given free\nreign. Wittgenstein's early work in the <em>Tractatus</em> (1961)\nfollowed in that vein. But in these lectures, given in 1938, we see a\nmind well into a transition away from those simplifying templates,\nthose conceptual pictures. Here, examples <em>themselves</em> do a\ngood deal of philosophical work, and their significance is that they\n<em>give</em>, rather than merely illustrate, the philosophical point\nat hand. He said, earlier in the lectures, that he is trying to teach\na new way of thinking about aesthetics (and indeed about philosophy\nitself).</p>", "<p>\n\nThe subject, as he said in his opening line, is very big and entirely\nmisunderstood. It is very big in its scope\u2014in the reach of the\naesthetic dimension throughout human life.</p>", "<p>\n\nBut we can now, at the end of his lectures, see that it is a big\nsubject in other senses too: aesthetics is conceptually expansive in\nits important linkages to the philosophy of language, to the\nphilosophy of mind, to ethics, and to other areas of philosophy, and\nit resists encapsulation into a single, unifying problem. It is a\nmulti-faceted, multi-aspected human cultural phenomenon where\nconnections, of diverging kinds, are more in play than causal\nrelations. The form of explanation we find truly satisfying will thus\nstrikingly diverge from the form of explanation in science \u2013 the\nmodels of explanation in <em>Naturwissenschaften</em> are misapplied\nin <em>Geisteswissenschaften,</em> and the viewing of the latter\nthrough the lens of the former will yield reduction, exclusion, and\nultimately distortion. The humanities are thus, for Wittgenstein, in\nthis sense autonomous.</p>", "<p>\n\nAll of this, along with the impoverishing and blinding superimposition\nof conceptual models, templates, and pictures onto the extraordinarily\nrich world of aesthetic engagement, also now, at the end of his\nlectures, gives content to what Wittgenstein meant at the beginning\nwith the words \u201centirely misunderstood\u201d. For now, at this\nstage of Wittgenstein's development, where the complexity-accepting\nstance of the later <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> (1958) and\nother work is unearthing and uprooting the philosophical\npresuppositions of the simplification-seeking earlier work, examples\nthemselves have priority as indispensable instruments in the struggle\nto free ourselves of misconception in the aesthetic realm. And these\nexamples, given due and detailed attention, will exhibit a\ncontext-sensitive particularity that makes generalized pronouncements\nhovering high above the ground of that detail look otiose,\ninattentive, or, more bluntly, just a plain falsification of\nexperience. What remains is not, then\u2014and this is an idea\nWittgenstein's auditors must themselves have struggled with in those\nrooms in Cambridge, as many still do today\u2014another theory built\nupon now stronger foundations, but rather a clear view of our\nmultiform aesthetic practices. Wittgenstein, in his mature, later\nwork, did not generate a theory of language, of mind, or of\nmathematics. He generated, rather, a vast body of work perhaps united\nonly in its therapeutic and intricately labored search for conceptual\nclarification. One sees the same philosophical aspiration driving his\nforay into aesthetics.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "wittgenstein-aesthetics"]}
{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/private-language/", "title": "Private Language", "text": ["<p>\nWittgenstein\u2019s main attack on the idea of a private language is\ncontained in \u00a7\u00a7244\u2013271 of <em>Philosophical\nInvestigations</em> (though the ramifications of the matter are\nrecognizably pursued until \u00a7315). These passages, especially\nthose from \u00a7256 onwards, are now commonly known as \u2018the\nprivate language argument\u2019, despite the fact that he brings\nfurther considerations to bear on the topic in other places in his\nwritings; and despite the fact that the broader context, of\n\u00a7\u00a7243\u2013315, does not contain a singular critique of\njust one idea, namely, a private language\u2014rather, the passages\naddress many issues, such as privacy, identity, inner/outer relations,\nsensations as objects, and sensations as justification for sensation\ntalk, amongst others.</p>", "<p>\nNevertheless, the main argument of \u00a7\u00a7244\u2013271 is,\napparently, readily summarized. The conclusion is that a language in\nprinciple unintelligible to anyone but its originating user is\nimpossible. The reason for this is that such a so-called language\nwould, necessarily, be unintelligible to its supposed originator too,\nfor he would be unable to establish meanings for its putative\nsigns.</p>", "<p>\nWe should, however, note that Wittgenstein himself never employs the\nphrase \u2018private language argument\u2019. And a few commentators\n(e.g., Baker 1998, Canfield 2001 pp. 377\u20139, Stroud 2000 p. 69)\nhave questioned the very existence in the relevant passages of a\nunified structure properly identifiable as a sustained argument. This\nsuggestion, however, depends for its plausibility on a tendentiously\nnarrow notion of argument\u2014roughly, as a kind of proof, with\nidentifiable premisses and a firm conclusion, rather than the more\ngeneral sense which would include the exposure of a confusion through\na variety of reasoned twists and turns, of qualifications,\nweighings-up and re-thinkings\u2014and is a reaction against some\ndrastic and artificial reconstructions of the text by earlier writers.\nNevertheless, there is a point to be made, and the summary above\nconceals, as we shall see, a very intricate discussion.</p>", "<p>\nEven among those who accept that there is a reasonably self-contained\nand straightforward private language argument to be discussed, there\nhas been fundamental and widespread disagreement over its details, its\nsignificance and even its intended conclusion, let alone over its\nsoundness. The result is that every reading of the argument (including\nthat which follows) is controversial. Some of this disagreement has\narisen because of the notorious difficulty and occasional elusiveness\nof Wittgenstein\u2019s own text (sometimes augmented by problems of\ntranslation). But much derives from the tendency of philosophers to\nread into the text their own preconceptions without making them\nexplicit and asking themselves whether its author shared them. Some\ncommentators, for instance, supposing it obvious that sensations are\nprivate, have interpreted the argument as intended to show they cannot\nbe talked about; some, supposing the argument to be an obvious but\nunsustainable attempt to wrest special advantage from scepticism about\nmemory, have maintained it to be unsound because it self-defeatingly\nimplies the impossibility of public discourse as well as private; some\nhave assumed it to be a direct attack on the problem of other minds;\nsome have claimed it to commit Wittgenstein to behaviourism or\nverificationism; some have thought it to imply that language is, of\nnecessity, not merely potentially but actually social (this has come\nto be called the \u2018community view\u2019 of the argument).</p>", "<p>\nThe early history of the secondary literature is largely one of\ndisputation over these matters. Yet what these earlier commentators\nhave in common is significant enough to outweigh their differences and\nmake it possible to speak of them as largely sharing an Orthodox\nunderstanding of the argument. After the publication in 1982 of Saul\nKripke\u2019s definitely unorthodox book, however, in which he suggested\nthat the argument poses a sceptical problem about the whole notion of\nmeaning, public or private, disputation conducted by Orthodox rules of\nengagement was largely displaced by a debate on the issues arising\nfrom Kripke\u2019s interpretation. (However, there is overlap: Kripke\nhimself adheres to the community view of the argument\u2019s implications,\nwith the result that renewed attention has been paid to that issue,\ndispute over which began in 1954.) Both debates, though, show a\ntendency to proceed with only the most cursory attention to the\noriginal argument which started them off.</p>", "<p>\nThis rush to judgment about what is at stake, compounded by a\nwidespread willingness to discuss commentators\u2019 more accessible\naccounts of the text rather than confront its difficulties directly,\nhas made it hard to recover the original from the accretion of more or\nless tendentious interpretation which has grown up around it. Such a\nrecovery is one of the tasks attempted in this article. The criterion\nof success in this task which is employed here is one of coherence: a\ngood account should accommodate all of Wittgenstein\u2019s remarks in\n\u00a7\u00a7244\u2013271, their (not necessarily linear) ordering as\nwell as their content, and should make clear how these remarks fit\nwith the context provided by the rest of the book. (One of the\nproblems with many of the commentaries on this matter, especially the\nearlier ones, is that their writers have quarried the text for\nindividual remarks which have then been re-woven into a set of views\nsaid to be Wittgenstein\u2019s but whose relation to the original is\ntenuous. A striking example of this approach is Norman Malcolm\u2019s\nfamous and influential 1954 review of <em>Philosophical\nInvestigations</em>, which was commonly taken as an accurate\nrepresentation of Wittgenstein\u2019s own thinking and formed the target of\nmany \u201crefutations\u201d.)</p>", "<p>\nInterpretation of Wittgenstein started to become even more complex at\nthe close of the twentieth century, as commentators began to focus on\nbroad questions of method. In both <cite>Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus</cite> and <cite>Philosophical\nInvestigations</cite> there is a tension between some statements that\nseem to be stating controversial philosophical positions and others\nthat seem to be saying that philosophy ought not to offer\ncontroversial theses but only work with what we already know by being\ncompetent language users embedded in human circumstances. In the\nlatter book there are passages that seem to support an\nanti-philosophical position and others that seem to offer interesting\nnew philosophical views in the process of criticizing more traditional\nphilosophical doctrines such as foundationalism and Cartesianism.\nAlong these lines, two overlapping distinctions concerning how to read\n<cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite> have arisen: the\nresolute\u2013substantial distinction, and the\nPyrrhonian\u2013non-Pyrrhonian distinction. In general, the resolute\nand Pyrrhonian readings make Wittgenstein out to be an\nanti-philosopher, one who is not offering positive philosophical\ntheses to replace false ones; rather, his goal is to show the\nnonsensical nature of traditional philosophical theorizing. It is this\ngoal that is partly responsible for the unique style of\n<cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite> (its dialogical and, at\nleast at times, anti-dogmatic, therapeutic character). On the\nsubstantial and non-Pyrrhonian readings, Wittgenstein is not only\npresenting a method for exposing the errors of traditional\nphilosophers, but also showing how philosophy should rightly be done\nand thereby offering positive philosophical views, views which must\noften be inferred or reconstructed from an elusive text. </p>", "<p>\nThere is neither a single resolute/Pyrrhonian nor a single\nsubstantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading of Wittgenstein. Moreover, there is\nan important difference between the resolute\u2013substantial and\nPyrrhonian\u2013non-Pyrrhonian distinctions. The former distinction\narises from a continuing debate on how to read <cite>Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus</cite>, both on its own and in relation to\n<cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite> (see, e.g., Conant 2004 and\nMulhall 2007), and is associated with the so-called New\nWittgensteinians (see, e.g., Crary and Read 2000). The Pyrrhonian and\nnon-Pyrrhonian discussion is to be found, for example, in Fogelin\n(1994), Sluga (2004), and Stern (2004, 2007), and concerns the ways in\nwhich Wittgenstein might be considered as writing in the tradition of\nthe ancient Pyrrhonian sceptics, who were philosophically sceptical\nabout the very possibility of philosophy (see Fogelin 1994, pp. 3ff\nand 205ff). These distinctions cut across the distinction between\nOrthodox and Kripkean non-orthodox readings of the text: both Orthodox\n<em>and</em> Kripkean non-orthodox interpreters have tended to offer\nsubstantial or non-Pyrrhonian readings of Wittgenstein\u2014though\nthe line may not always be clear and some (e.g., Hacker, 1990) move\nfrom a resolute/Pyrrhonian to a substantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading\nwithout remarking the fact.</p>", "<p>\nSome (Fogelin, Stern, and Mulhall, for example) have come to question\nwhether it makes sense to suppose that either one or the other,\nresolute/Pyrrhonian or substantial/non-Pyrrhonian, must be\n<em>the</em> correct way to read Wittgenstein. Fogelin and Stern see\nthe tension in the text of <cite>Philosophical Investigations\n</cite>as the expression of a tension, indeed a struggle, within its\nauthor, between his wanting to uncover the \u2018disguised\nnonsense\u2019 of philosophical theses and his being tempted and\ndrawn into still other philosophical positions on the nature of\nlanguage, reference, private experience, and philosophy itself. In\nwhat is surely a reference to \u00a7133c\u2014which reads: \u2018The\nreal discovery is the one that enables me to break off philosophizing\nwhen I want to. \u2014 The one that gives philosophy peace, so that\nit is no longer tormented by questions which bring <em>itself</em> in\nquestion\u2019\u2014Wittgenstein is reported by Rush Rhees to have\nsaid \u2018In my book I say that I am able to leave off with a\nproblem in philosophy when I want to. But that\u2019s a lie; I can\u2019t\u2019\n(Rhees, 1984, p. 219 n. 7). According to Stern, the Wittgenstein of\nthe <cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite> is more Pyrrhonian than\nnot, while understanding all too acutely the attraction of philosophy\nand the difficulty of giving it up. One\u2019s stance on these matters\naffects how one reads the private language sections, in particular by\nraising the question whether Wittgenstein intends to argue that the\npositive claim of the possibility of a private language is false, or\nis some kind of nonsense. </p>", "<p>\nIf someone were to insist that a private language is possible, one way\nto argue against him would be by employing the method of <i>reductio\nad absurdum</i>: assume that it is true that a private language is\npossible, show that that assumption leads to certain absurdities or a\ncontradiction, and then conclude that it is actually false that a\nprivate language is possible. This is the way in which the argument\nwas typically understood. But this understanding has come into\nquestion. In contrast to his earlier commentaries, for example, Gordon\nBaker has since called into question whether the private language\nsections should not be read as attempting to show that the notion of a\nprivate language is intelligible but false, but rather that it is\nnonsense masquerading as an important possibility (Baker, 1998).</p>", "<p>\nThere is, however, in Wittgenstein\u2019s thinking an inclination to think\nof contradiction in terms of the disintegration of sense, so that even\nargument by <i>reductio</i> might be understood not in terms of\nfalsehood. (The appearance of this inclination in <cite>Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus</cite>, for example, is well mapped by Fogelin\n[1995, Ch. IV].) And it is characteristic of Wittgenstein to talk of\n<em>philosophical</em> error in terms of nonsense. In \u00a7119 of\n<cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite> he writes, e.g., \u2018The\nresults of philosophy are the discovery of some piece of plain\nnonsense and of bumps that the understanding has got by running up\nagainst the limits of language. They\u00a0\u2014 these bumps \u2014\nmake us see the value of that discovery.\u2019 And in \u00a7464:\n\u2018What I want to teach is: to pass from unobvious nonsense to\nobvious nonsense.\u2019 In the discussion of the possibility of a\nprivate language it may well at first seem as though we understand the\npossibility under consideration. After all we seem to understand the\nquestion in \u00a7256, \u2018Now, what about the language which\ndescribes my inner experiences and which only I myself can\nunderstand?\u2019 But is Wittgenstein suggesting we <em>only</em>\nseem to understand this question? </p>", "<p>\nThe matter may not be clear. Shortly after the main private language\nsections, the following remark occurs as part of a dialogue, \u2018It\namounts to this: that only of a living human being and what resembles\n(behaves like) a living human being can one say: it has sensations; it\nsees; is blind; hears; is deaf; is conscious or unconscious\u2019\n(\u00a7281). The dialogue continues in \u00a7282:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n\u201cBut in a fairy tale a pot too can see and hear!\u201d\n(Certainly; but it <em>can</em> also talk.)</p>\n\n<p>\n\u201cBut a fairy tale only invents what is not the case: it does not\ntalk <em>nonsense</em>, does it?\u201d \u2014 It\u2019s not as simple as\nthat. Is it untrue or nonsensical to say that a pot talks? Does one\nhave a clear idea of the circumstances in which we\u2019d say of a pot that\nit talked? (Even a nonsense poem is not nonsense in the same way as\nthe babble of a baby.)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nHere the question of how the <cite>Investigations</cite> is to be read\nintrudes. For example, part of the distinction between what Mulhall\ncalls resolute and substantial readings of Wittgenstein concerns the\nsense in which Wittgenstein aimed to \u2018overcome our attraction to\nthe idea that there is something that we cannot do in\nphilosophy\u2019 (Mulhall, 2007, p. 8; cf. <cite>Philosophical\nInvestigations</cite> \u00a7374). Mulhall claims that that idea goes\nagainst the moral of <cite>Investigations</cite> \u00a7500:\n\u2018When a sentence is called senseless, it is not, as it were, its\nsense that is senseless. Rather, a combination of words is being\nexcluded from the language, withdrawn from circulation.\u2019\nFurther, this substantial reading attributes to Wittgenstein an\nimplicit philosophical theory of meaning, \u2018of the (now\ngrammatical) conditions of sense\u2014quite as if our everyday\nabilities to distinguish sense from nonsense require at the very least\na philosophical grounding or foundation (perhaps a criterial\nsemantics, or a theory of language-games, or an anthropology of the\nhuman life form\u2019 (Mulhall, 2007, p. 9). By contrast, on a\nresolute reading of <cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite>,\nWittgenstein\u2019s appeal to the notion of a grammatical investigation\ninvolves the deployment of \u2018our everyday capacity to distinguish\nsense from nonsense in a philosophical context, and hence as depriving\nitself of any claim to expertise or authority that exceeds that form\nof practical ability\u2014an ability that can equally well be laid\nclaim to by any competent speaker, and hence by any philosophical\ninterlocutor\u2019 (ibid., p. 10). Further, the resolute reading is\nespecially firm in rejecting the idea that there is something\ndeterminate that we cannot do, the idea that there is something,\nnamely, a private language, that cannot be achieved; there is not a\nlimitation on language. Rather, the idea is simply nonsense, or as\nMulhall later puts it (ibid. p. 18): no sense can be given to the idea\nof a <em>philosophically substantial</em> private language.</p>", "<p>\nThough Mulhall claims that the private language sections can\njustifiably be read either resolutely or substantially\u2014because\n\u2018each reading can \u2026 point to an aspect of the text that\nit fully acknowledges, and whose proper acknowledgment by the other is\nat the very least an issue for it, it would seem profitless to insist\nthat one reading is essentially faithful to Wittgenstein\u2019s text and\nthe other intrinsically faithless\u2019 (ibid., p. 20)\u2014it is\nplain that he thinks the resolute reading is to be preferred. However,\nwe may not need to choose. We might view the private language sections\nas Wittgenstein\u2019s asking, \u2018Do we have a clear picture of the\ncircumstances in which we should say that someone spoke a private\nlanguage?\u2019 The line of reasoning that follows \u00a7243 can be\nread as various attempts to achieve a clear picture of what it might\nmean to speak a private language, where the attempts ultimately fail,\nwith the result that what at first sight seemed intelligible (\u2018a\nlanguage which describes my inner experiences and which only I myself\ncan understand\u2019) turns out not to be intelligible after all. And\nin so far as we cannot make intelligible the circumstances in which\nthere could be a private language, we should say that the idea of a\nprivate language is nonsense. However, as we saw above, in \u00a7282\nWittgenstein seems to suggest that the border between nonsense and\nfalsehood is itself unclear; and moreover, in trying to make sense of\nthe possibility of a private language, we may find, in different parts\nof the chain of reasoning, suggestions of falsehood as well as of\nnonsensicality. </p>", "<p>\nThe issue\u2019s significance can be seen by considering how the argument\nis embedded in the structure of <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>.\nImmediately prior to the introduction of the argument\n(\u00a7\u00a7241f), Wittgenstein suggests that the existence of the\nrules governing the use of language and making communication possible\ndepends on agreement in human behaviour\u2014such as the uniformity\nin normal human reaction which makes it possible to train most\nchildren to look at something by pointing at it. (Unlike cats, which\nreact in a seemingly random variety of ways to pointing.) One function\nof the private language argument is to show that not only actual\nlanguages but the very possibility of language and concept formation\ndepends on the possibility of such agreement.</p>", "<p>\nAnother, related, function is to oppose the idea that metaphysical\nabsolutes are within our reach, that we can find at least part of the\nworld as it really is in the sense that any other way of conceiving\nthat part must be wrong (cf. <cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite>\np. 230). Philosophers are especially tempted to suppose that numbers\nand sensations are examples of such absolutes, self-identifying\nobjects which themselves force upon us the rules for the use of their\nnames. Wittgenstein discusses numbers in earlier sections on rules\n(185\u2013242). Some of his points have analogues in his discussion\nof sensations, for there is a common underlying confusion about how\nthe act of meaning determines the future application of a formula or\nname. In the case of numbers, one temptation is to confuse the\nmathematical sense of \u2018determine\u2019 in which, say, the\nformula <em>y</em> = 2<em>x</em> determines the numerical value of\n<em>y</em> for a given value of <em>x</em> (in contrast with\n<em>y</em> &gt; 2<em>x</em>, which does not) with a causal sense in\nwhich a certain training in mathematics determines that normal people\nwill always write the same value for <em>y</em> given both the first\nformula and a value for <em>x</em>\u2014in contrast with creatures\nfor which such training might produce a variety of outcomes (cf.\n\u00a7189). This confusion produces the illusion that the result of an\nactual properly conducted calculation is the inevitable outcome of the\nmathematical determining, as though the formula\u2019s meaning itself were\nshaping the course of events.</p>", "<p>\nIn the case of sensations, the parallel temptation is to suppose that\nthey are self-intimating. Itching, for example, seems like this: one\njust feels what it is directly; if one then gives the sensation a\nname, the rules for that name\u2019s subsequent use are already determined\nby the sensation itself. Wittgenstein tries to show that this\nimpression is illusory, that even itching derives its identity only\nfrom a sharable practice of expression, reaction and use of language.\nIf itching were a metaphysical absolute, forcing its identity upon me\nin the way described, then the possibility of such a shared practice\nwould be irrelevant to the concept of itching: the nature of itching\nwould be revealed to me in a single mental act of naming it (the kind\nof mental act which Russell called \u2018acquaintance\u2019); all\nsubsequent facts concerning the use of the name would be irrelevant to\nhow that name was meant; and the name could be private. The private\nlanguage argument is intended to show that such subsequent facts could\nnot be irrelevant, that no names could be private, and that the notion\nof having the true identity of a sensation revealed in a single act of\nacquaintance is a confusion.</p>", "<p>\nThe suggestion that a language could be private in the way described\nappears most openly in the second of Bertrand Russell\u2019s published\nlectures \u2018The Philosophy of Logical Atomism\u2019, where\nRussell says:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nIn a logically perfect language, there will be one word and no more\nfor every simple object, and everything that is not simple will be\nexpressed by a combination of words, by a combination derived, of\ncourse, from the words for the simple things that enter in, one word\nfor each simple component. A language of that sort will be completely\nanalytic, and will show at a glance the logical structure of the facts\nasserted or denied. \u2026 A logically perfect language, if it could\nbe constructed, would not only be intolerably prolix, but, as regards\nits vocabulary, would be very largely private to one speaker. That is\nto say, all the names that it would use would be private to that\nspeaker and could not enter into the language of another speaker.</p>\n\n<p>\n\u2026 A name, in the narrow logical sense of a word whose meaning\nis a particular, can only be applied to a particular with which the\nspeaker is acquainted, because you cannot name anything you are not\nacquainted with.</p>\n\n<p>\n\u2026 One can use \u2018this\u2019 as a name to stand for a\nparticular with which one is acquainted at the moment. We say\n\u2018This is white\u2019. \u2026 But if you try to apprehend the\nproposition that I am expressing when I say \u2018This is\nwhite\u2019, you cannot do it. If you mean this piece of chalk as a\nphysical object, then you are not using a proper name. It is only when\nyou use \u2018this\u2019 quite strictly, to stand for an actual\nobject of sense [i.e., a sense-datum], that it is really a proper\nname. And in that it has a very odd property for a proper name, namely\nthat it seldom means the same thing two moments running and does not\nmean the same thing to the speaker and to the hearer.</p>\n\n<p>\n\u2026 [I]n order to understand a name for a particular, the only\nthing necessary is to be acquainted with that particular. When you are\nacquainted with that particular, you have a full, adequate and\ncomplete understanding of the name, and no further information is\nrequired.</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nAlthough Wittgenstein does not explicitly say so, it is likely that\nthis is the inspiration of his argument: his writing is marked in many\nplaces by criticism of Russell, both explicit and otherwise. </p>", "<p>\nIn this context, we should take a moment to note a set of issues of\nincreasing interest, namely, ones found in Cora Diamond\u2019s claim in\n\u2018Does Bismarck Have a Beetle In His Box\u2019 that:</p>", "<p style=\"margin-left: 40px;\">\nThe <em>Tractatus</em> provides us with arguments against the\nRussellian idea of someone else\u2019s private object, the beetle in\nBismarck\u2019s box. It lets us see that any such beetle would have no role\nin language or thought, but it left unmolested the beetle in one\u2019s own\nbox. Russell\u2019s conception of how we can think about things in the\nminds of others was subjected to a critique, but the\n<em>Tractatus</em> left unexamined a questionable conception of what\nit is for our words to be about things in our own minds. (p. 283)</p>", "<p>\nIt would not be until post-Tractarian work that Wittgenstein would\nturn his attention to question of private objects in one\u2019s own\nmind.  Regarding Russell, as Diamond sees it, his commitment both to\nprivate objects and their possibility/admissibility comes primarily\nfrom his views on knowledge by acquaintance in contrast to knowledge\nby description, an important part of which is his holding that\n\u201c\u2026the chief importance of knowledge by description is\nthat it enables us to pass beyond the limits of our private\nexperience. In spite of the fact that we can only know truths which\nare wholly composed of terms which we have experienced in\nacquaintance, we can yet have knowledge by description of things which\nwe have never experienced\u201d (quoted in Diamond [2000],\np. 267). Further, according to Diamond, it is Russell\u2019s\nunderstanding and use of quantification that he employs to provide a\nway to get around the problem of not being acquainted with the\n\u2018private\u2019 objects in the minds of others. While Bismarck\nknows by direct acquaintance the meaning of \u2018<em>This</em> is\nexcruciating\u2019 said of his sensation, another can only say,\n\u2018Bismarck\u2019s sensation is excruciating\u2019. However,\nthis can be meaningful once we understand that the its meaning is to\nbe analyzed in terms of, \u2018Something is a sensation, had now by\nBismarck, and it is excruciating\u2019 (p. 273). Once she has\nidentified the importance of the issue of privacy for Russell, and\nlaid out the details of his position, she is primarily concerned to\nshow how Wittgenstein\u2019s views in the <em>Tractatus</em>\n(particularly on quantification, logical space, and there not being\nlogical objects that serve as the referents of terms such as\n\u2018some\u2019 and \u2018all\u2019) undermine Russell\u2019s\nposition on quantification and private objects in other people\u2019s\nminds. Further, she argues, briefly, for the importance of there being\na \u2018private language argument\u2019 in the\n<em>Tractatus</em> along two main lines. First, she takes it to be\nimportant for our understanding of Wittgenstein\u2019s work and its\ndevelopment (and here her argument is firmly in line with her\nPyrrhonian and resolute reading of the <em>Tractatus</em> and its\ncontinuity with Wittgenstein\u2019s later work). Second, she takes it to\nhave implications for Michael Dummett\u2019s way of framing the realism and\nanti-realism issue, especially as it relates to the\n<em>Tractatus</em>. Against Dummett, she sees the <em>Tractatus</em>\nas putting forward an anti-realist position, \u201c\u2026at any\nrate about other people\u2019s private objects\u201d (p. 284).</p>", "<p>\nAs this entry is focused on the private language considerations found\nprimarily in the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, we will not go\ninto further detail regarding Diamond\u2019s argument. However, as\nnoted above, the issues she raises are of increasing interest both\ndirectly and indirectly. Directly, they are engaged by William\nChild\u2019s recent \u2019Does the <em>Tractatus</em> contain a\nprivate language argument?\u2019 in which he argues that Diamond is\nmore or less wrong across the board in her main contentions regarding\nthere being a private language argument in the <em>Tractatus</em> and\nher assessment of the <em>Tractatus</em> as anti-realist. His central\ncontention is that Diamond projects views attributable to the later\nWittgenstein into the <em>Tractatus</em>, particularly those\nconcerning naming and use. However, he also argues that\nWittgenstein\u2019s 1929 views on sensation language\n\u2018challenge\u2019 \u2018new\u2019 readings of\nthe <em>Tractatus</em>, such as Diamond\u2019s, where by \u2018new\nreadings\u2019 he means ones that, \u201cfind in\nthe <em>Tractatus</em> an absence of positive philosophical doctrines,\na kind of quietism, and an explicitly therapeutic approach that have\ntraditionally been associated with Wittgenstein\u2019s later\nphilosophy\u201d (p. 143). </p>", "<p>\nIndirectly, Diamond\u2019s piece is in line with an increasing interest in\nquestions of how to read Wittgenstein, such as those we noted above in\nour discussion of the resolute-substantial and\nPyrrhonian-non-Pyrrhonian \u2018Wittgensteins\u2019. The issues raised in these\ncontexts have further relevance for understanding other central\nWittgensteinian themes such as how best to respond to the temptations\nof solipsism (see Stern [2010] for a helpful overview of many of these\nissues; he does not discuss Diamond directly, but he does focus on the\nquestion of the development of Wittgenstein\u2019s thought and, for\nexample, the question of solipsism in the context of private language\nconsiderations. Another recent example of interest in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nphilosophical development, and explicitly one that concerns private\nlanguage, is Nielson [2008]). </p>", "<p>\nTo return to our exposition of the private language concerns found in\nthe <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, in distinction from\nRussell\u2019s work, for example, the idea of a private language is more\nusually hidden: the confusions supposed to belong to it allegedly\nunderlie a range of articulated philosophical notions and theories,\nwithout themselves being so articulated. The argument is thus perhaps\nmost profitably read as targeting, not any particular theory, but\nrather the motivation for considering a range of apparently\nindependent or even competing theories along with their associated\ntasks, problems and solutions.</p>", "<p>\nFor example, a still very common idea, often attributed to John Locke\nand openly embraced by Jerry Fodor in the nineteen seventies, is that\ninterpersonal spoken communication works by speakers\u2019 translation of\ntheir internal mental vocabularies into sounds followed by hearers\u2019\nre-translation into their own internal vocabularies. Again, Descartes\nconsidered himself able to talk to himself about his experiences while\nclaiming to be justified in saying that he does not know (or not until\nhe has produced a reassuring philosophical argument) anything at all\nabout an external world conceived as something independent of them.\nAnd he and others have thought: while I may make mistakes about the\nexternal world, I can infallibly avoid error if I confine my judgments\nto my immediate sensations. (Compare <cite>The Principles of\nPhilosophy</cite>, I, 9.) Again, many philosophers, including John\nStuart Mill, have supposed there to be a problem of other minds,\naccording to which I may reasonably doubt the legitimacy of applying,\nsay, sensation-words to beings other than myself.</p>", "<p>\nIn each of these examples, the implication is that the internal\nvehicle of my musings could in principle be private (as Kenny [1966,\np. 369] showed, this vehicle does not have to be a <em>language</em>\nfor the argument to apply to it): for these problems and theories even\nto make sense, sharability must be irrelevant to meaning and it must\nbe at least conceivable that my knowledge, even my understanding, is\nnecessarily confined to my own case. The implication is of course\noften denied. The terms of Fodor\u2019s language of thought, for example,\nare supposed to be able to refer to public objects. But the question\nis, on what basis does this ability rest? However this question should\nbe answered, Fodor himself was concerned enough about Wittgenstein\u2019s\nargument to try to show both that it did not apply to his views\nand\u2014apparently superfluously\u2014that it is not a good\nargument anyway (Fodor pp. 68\u201373). The matter is clearer with\nDescartes (compare Kenny 1966): for his sceptical question to be\nraised without being immediately self-defeating, he must hold it\npossible to identify his experiences inwardly\u2014where\n\u2018inwardly\u2019 means without relying on resources supplied by\nhis essential embodiment in a world whose existence is independent of\nhis own mind and accessible to others (e.g., such resources as the\nconcepts acquired in a normal upbringing). The question which\naccordingly looms large in the private language argument is: How is\nthis identification of one\u2019s experiences to be achieved?</p>", "<p>\nHowever, it cannot be emphasized too strongly that the significance of\nthe private language argument does not rest on the scholarly detail of\nwhether this or that thinker can be correctly described as committed\nto the idea. The target is a way of thinking which generates\nphilosophical theories, not the theories themselves.</p>", "<p>\nAs already noted, the private language sections of <cite>Philosophical\nInvestigations</cite> are usually held to begin at \u00a7243 (though\nwe shall see that Wittgenstein relies on points made much earlier in\nthe book). The methodological issues canvassed above arise at the\noutset, in the interpretation of \u00a7243\u2019s crucial second\nparagraph.</p>", "<p>\nOn a substantial/non-Pyrrhonian reading, Wittgenstein begins to\nclarify what kind of philosophically important notion of private\nlanguage is to be examined, i.e., one that is necessarily private and\nwhich refers to one\u2019s immediate private sensations. In the remarks\nthat follow, Wittgenstein argues that the idea of such a private\nlanguage is nonsensical or incoherent because it is a violation of\ngrammar (i.e., Wittgenstein draws on his substantive views on\nmeaning). </p>", "<p>\nOn a resolute/Pyrrhonian reading, it is emphasized that the reader is\nasked in the first sentence of the second paragraph whether one can\nactually <em>imagine</em> a language for one\u2019s inner experiences, for\nprivate use. Wittgenstein at this point reminds the interlocutor that\nwe already use ordinary language for that. But the interlocutor\nquickly replies in the last three lines of \u00a7243 that what he is\nasking is whether we can imagine <em>a private language that refers to\nwhat only the speaker can know</em>. In the following sections,\nWittgenstein examines \u2018whether there is a way of meaning the\nwords of the penultimate sentence [of \u00a7243] that does not simply\nreturn us to a banality, whether in fact his interlocutor means\nanything in particular with those words\u2019 (Mulhall 2007, p. 18).\nThe question is whether the notion of a language \u2018which only I\nmyself can understand\u2019 can be given any substantial meaning to\nbegin with. On this latter reading, \u00a7\u00a7258 and 270, for\nexample, are attempts to give the interlocutor what he says he wants,\nbut which, in the end, amount to nothing (in the case of 258) or bring\nus back to a publicly understandable language (in the case of\n270).</p>", "<p>\nAs we saw above, in section 1.2, it is not clear that we must choose\nbetween these two readings. On either, the point of the private\nlanguage argument is that the idea is exposed as unintelligible when\npressed\u2014we cannot make sense of the circumstances in which we\nshould say that someone is using a private language.</p>", "<p>\nSo, having introduced the idea of a private language in the way\nalready quoted, Wittgenstein goes on to argue in a preliminary\ndiscussion (\u00a7\u00a7244\u2013255) that there are two senses of\n\u2018private\u2019 which a philosopher might have in mind in\nsuggesting that sensations are private, and that sensations as they\nare talked about in natural languages (such as English and German) are\nin fact private in neither of them. He then turns, at \u00a7256, to\nthe question whether there could be a private language at all. He\ncontinues to talk of sensations, and of pain as an example, but one\nshould remember that these are not <em>our</em> sensations, the\neveryday facts of human existence, but the supposed exemplars of\n<em>philosophical accounts</em> of the everyday facts. Thus, for\ninstance, they might be the sensations of something like a Cartesian\nsoul (perhaps one associated with a physical body, as indicated in\n\u00a7\u00a7257 and 283), something which has no publicly available\nmental life and whose \u201cexperiences\u201d are accordingly\nprivate. (It is worth noting that the earlier Anscombe translation is\nmisleading here: in \u00a7243, for example, where the idea of a\nprivate language is introduced, it loses the crucial contrast, so\nevident in the original German, between the ordinary human beings\ndescribed as solitary speakers in the first paragraph and the second\nparagraph\u2019s mysterious \u2018one\u2019 who is the\n\u2018speaker\u2019 of a private language and whose nature is\ncarefully left unclear. See the recent 4th edition translation of this\nparagraph, a relevant part is in the first sentence of this article,\nto find a version closer to the original German.) Consistent with this\npoint is that in \u00a7256 Wittgenstein suggests that one cannot\narrive at the idea of a private language by considering a natural\nlanguage: natural languages are not private, for our sensations are\nexpressed. But neither can we arrive at the idea by starting with a\nnatural language and just subtracting from it all expression of\nsensations (temporary paralysis is clearly not in question), as he\nconsiders next, for as he says in \u00a7257, even if there could be\nlanguage in such a situation as this where teaching is impossible, the\nearlier argument of <cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite>\n(\u00a7\u00a733\u201335), concerning ostensive definition, has shown\nthat mere \u201cmental association\u201d of one thing with another\nis not alone enough to make the one into a name of the other. Naming\none\u2019s sensation requires a place for the new word: that is, a notion\nof sensation. The attempt to name a sensation in a conceptual vacuum\nmerely raises the questions of what this business is supposed to\nconsist in, and what is its <em>point</em>. But, for the sake of\ngetting to the heart of the matter, Wittgenstein puts the first of\nthese questions on one side and pretends that it is sufficient for the\nsecond to imagine himself in the position of establishing a private\nlanguage for the purpose of keeping a diary of his sensations.</p>", "<p>\nHowever, to investigate the possibility of the imagined diary case by\nexploring it from the inside (the only way, he thinks, really to\nexpose the confusions involved) requires him to use certain words when\nit is just the right to use these words which is in question. Thus he\nis forced to mention in \u00a7258 examples like ostensive definition,\nconcentrating the attention, speaking, writing, remembering, believing\nand so on, in the very process of suggesting that none of these can\nreally occur in the situation under consideration (\u00a7261).</p>", "<p>\nThis difficulty has often gone unnoticed by commentators on the\nargument, with particularly unhappy results for the understanding of\nthe discussion of the diary example. Fogelin [1976], for instance, a\nparadigm representative of Orthodoxy, treats this as a case where\n<em>he himself</em>, a living embodied human being, keeps a diary and\nrecords the occurrences of a sensation which he finds it impossible to\ndescribe to anyone else. But we are not to assume that the description\nof the keeping of the diary is a description of a possible or even\nultimately intelligible case. In particular, we are not to think of\nsuch a human being\u2019s keeping a real diary, but of something like the\nCartesian internal equivalent. It is thus vital to the argument that\nthe diary case is presented in the first person, without our pressing\nthe question, \u2018Who is speaking?\u2019 At this stage we are\nsimply not to worry about whether the diary story ultimately makes\nsense or not. But the fact that it may not make sense must be\nremembered in reading what follows, which in strictness should\nconstantly be disfigured with scare quotes. (We shall, as we have\nalready, occasionally supply them as a reminder, reserving double\nquotes for this purpose.)</p>", "<p>\nTo summarize the argument\u2019s preliminary stage: In \u00a7256\nWittgenstein asked of the \u201cprivate language\u201d,\n\u2018<em>How</em> do I use words to signify my sensations?\u2019,\nand reminded us in \u00a7257 that we cannot answer \u2018As we\nordinarily do\u2019. So this question, which is the same question as\n\u2018How do I obtain meaning for the expressions in a \u201cprivate\nlanguage\u201d?\u2019 is still open; and the answer must be\nindependent of our <em>actual</em> connections between words and\nsensations. In the attempt to arrive at an answer, and explore the\nquestion in its full depth, he temporarily allows the use of the\nnotions of sensation and diary-keeping (despite the objections of\n\u00a7257), and imagines himself in the position of a private linguist\nrecording his sensations in a diary. The aim is to show that even if\nthis concession is made, meaning for a sensation-word still cannot be\nsecured and maintained by such a linguist. The crucial central part of\nthe argument begins here, at \u00a7258.</p>", "<p>\nWittgenstein points out in the diary case \u2018I first want to\nobserve that a definition of the sign cannot be formulated\u2019.\n(The translation here obscures the reason why. Wittgenstein\u2019s word is\n\u2018aussprechen\u2019, better translated as\n\u2018expressed\u2019 than \u2018formulated\u2019: the point\nfollows by definition from the fact that the case is one where the\ndefinition is private.) So if meaning is to be obtained for the\n\u201csign\u201d, this must be achieved through a private exercise\nof ostensive definition, where I concentrate on the sensation and\nproduce the sign at the same time. (In these circumstances, meaning\ncannot be extracted from a pre-existing practice of private use, since\nwhat is in question is how such a use could be established in the\nfirst place.) But if this exercise is to be genuine and successful\nostensive definition, it must <em>establish</em> the connection\nbetween sign and sensation, and this connection must <em>persist</em>.\nAs Wittgenstein says, \u2018\u201cI commit [the connection] to\nmemory\u201d can only mean: this process brings it about that I\nremember the connection <em>correctly</em> in the future\u2019. For I\ndo not define anything, even to myself let alone anyone else, by\nmerely attending to something and making a mark, unless this episode\nhas the appropriate consequences.</p>", "<p>\nAt this point we should suspend our exposition of the argument, in\norder to examine closely the remark \u2018this process brings it\nabout that I remember the connection <em>correctly</em> in the\nfuture\u2019.</p>", "<p>\nThis remark has usually been interpreted as a demand that, for the\nsign \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 to have been given a meaning, it must\nalways figure thereafter (if used affirmatively and sincerely) as a\ntrue statement: that is, I must use the sign \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019\naffirmatively only when I really do have the sensation <em>S</em>. And\nit has usually been thought that the subsequent argument concerns the\nadequacy of memory to ensure that I do not later misidentify my\nsensations and call a different kind of sensation\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 in the future. This account of the argument\nand its history is summed up by Anthony Kenny as follows:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nMany philosophers have taken \u2018I remember the connection\nright\u2019 to mean \u2018I use \u201c<em>S</em>\u201d when and\nonly when I really have <em>S</em>\u2019. They then take\nWittgenstein\u2019s argument to be based on scepticism about memory: how\ncan you be sure that you have remembered aright when next you call a\nsensation \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019? \u2026</p>\n\n<p>\nCritics of Wittgenstein have found the argument, so interpreted, quite\nunconvincing. Surely, they say, the untrustworthiness of memory\npresents no more and no less a problem for the user of a private\nlanguage than for the user of a public one. No, Wittgenstein\u2019s\ndefenders have said, for memory-mistakes about public objects may be\ncorrected, memory-mistakes about private sensations cannot; and where\ncorrection is impossible, talk of correctness is out of place. At this\npoint critics of Wittgenstein have either denied that truth demands\ncorrigibility, or have sought to show that checking is possible in the\nprivate case too. (Kenny[ 1973] pp. 191\u20132)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThis interplay of criticism and defence characterizes the Orthodox\ninterpretation of the argument. (See Fogelin [1976], pp. 162\u20134,\nfor a good example.) There seem to be at least two reasons why this\ninterpretation should have become established. First, philosophers\ncommitted to the idea of a private language are often looking for an\narrangement in which mistakes of fact are impossible; that is, they\nare trying to overcome scepticism by finding absolute certainty.\n(Descartes is the example usually cited.) And this would make\nsceptical arguments appear to be natural weapons to use in reply to\nthem. (See, e.g., Fogelin [1976] p. 153.) Secondly, it is\nplausible\u2014which is not the same as correct\u2014to suppose that\none cannot be mistaken concerning the natures of one\u2019s present\nsensations, and a supposed proof that the idea of a private language\nentails that one is just as fallible on this subject as on any other\ncould thus seem crippling to that idea.</p>", "<p>\nBut, as Kenny first showed, the question of factual infallibility in\nfuture uses of the sign \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 is not the issue. If\nwe look closely at \u00a7258, we see that \u2018I remember the\nconnection <em>correctly</em>\u2019 refers to remembering a\n<em>meaning</em>, namely, the meaning of the sign\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019, not to making sure that I infallibly apply\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 only to <em>S</em>\u2019s in the future. (Nor does\nthe private language argument depend on taking the latter to be an\neffect of the former.)</p>", "<p>\nNow that we are clearer about what the connection is which has to be\nremembered right, we can return to the exposition of the argument. I\nam to imagine that I am a private linguist. I have a sensation, and\nmake the mark \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 at the same time, as I might in\nan ordinary case introduce a sign by ostensive definition. Afterwards,\nI \u201cbelieve\u201d myself to have established a meaning for this\nsign \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019, and I now use it to judge that I am\nagain experiencing the same sensation. What do I mean by\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 on this second occasion? Wittgenstein\nconsiders two possible answers.</p>", "<h4>The First Answer</h4>", "<p>\nOne of the answers is that what I mean by \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 is\njust the sort of sensation I am now having. Of this Wittgenstein says\nmerely:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\u2026 whatever is going to seem correct to me is correct. And that\nonly means that here we can\u2019t talk about \u2018correct\u2019.\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThe point is highly condensed. Here is a more explicit version. For\nthere to be factual assertion, there must be the distinction between\ntruth and falsehood, between saying what is the case and saying what\nis not. For there to be the distinction between truth and falsehood,\nthere must be a further distinction between the source of the meaning,\nand the source of the truth, of what is said. Suppose that I confront\nsome object and say of it \u2018This is <em>S</em>\u2019. If I must\nalso appeal to this very object to make this utterance intelligible to\nmyself, I deprive it of any claim to the status of factual\nassertion\u2014it becomes, at best, ostensive definition. (The\n\u2018at best\u2019 is important here, for the same reason that the\ndiary example is not to be assumed genuinely possible.)</p>", "<h4>The Second Answer</h4>", "<p>\nThe second answer Wittgenstein considers to the question of what I\nmean by \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 is this: I mean by\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019, not this current sensation, but the\nsensation I named \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 in the past. We have\nalready seen, in Kenny\u2019s rejection of the Orthodox reading of the\nargument, that scepticism about memory has no place in the discussion\nof \u201cprivate language\u201d; the text simply does not support\nit. But at this point we must break with Kenny too. For according to\nhis account the crucial claim becomes: \u2018If it is possible for me\nto misremember my previous ostensive definition of\n\u201c<em>S</em>\u201d, then I do not really know what\n\u201c<em>S</em>\u201d means.\u2019 (See, e.g., Kenny [1973] p.\n194.) This is just conventional scepticism about memory extended to\ninclude meanings as well as judgments. And it is an elementary point\nof epistemology that knowing something does not obviously entail just\nas a result of the definition of knowledge that it is\n<em>impossible</em> for one to be wrong about that thing, only that\none is not in fact wrong.</p>", "<p>\nWhat has gone wrong? The answer is that Kenny\u2019s and the Orthodox\naccounts share an unnoticed assumption: that even in the circumstances\nof the \u201cprivate language\u201d there is actually an application\nof a sign to a private sensation by a private linguist. The problem as\nKenny then conceives it is one of later remembering this earlier\napplication in order that \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 should have\nretained its meaning. The question then seems to be whether one\u2019s\nadmittedly fallible memory is adequate for the maintenance of meaning.\nBut why should this assumption be allowed? What entitles us to assume\nthat a private linguist could even ostensively define his sign to\nhimself in the first place? As we have seen, this is one of the\nmatters in question; and \u00a7\u00a7260 and 261 show that\nWittgenstein was not prepared to let an argument in favour of private\nlanguage proceed from this assumption. In these two sections\nWittgenstein reminds us that his arguments in the earlier sections\n(e.g., 33\u201335) of <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> showed\nthat ostensive definition was not achieved by any performance unless\ncertain circumstantial conditions are fulfilled; and nothing about the\ndiary case as so far described shows them to be fulfilled. It is only\nlater (\u00a7\u00a7270\u2013271) that Wittgenstein imagines a partial\nfulfilment of them, and the result there is to render the language\npublic.</p>", "<p>\nOne cause of the muddle is Wittgenstein\u2019s insistence that there must\nbe a distinction between obeying a rule and merely thinking that one\nhas. This does not result, as the Orthodox have supposed, in a demand\nfor, and eventual rejection of, \u2018memory-infallibility in a\nprivate language\u2019: demand and rejection being based respectively\non the grounds that without infallibility one could always be going\nwrong and would never know if one were, and with infallibility one\nwould collapse the distinction between obeying a rule and merely\nthinking one was obeying it. Rather, the argument is this. The private\nlinguist cannot legislate a meaning for a sign by \u201cprivate\nostensive definition\u201d <em>merely</em>\u2014for this has to\nestablish a technique of using the sign (\u00a7260). The technique\ncannot function by means of repeated \u201costensive\ndefinitions\u201d, as we saw in examining the first answer, since\nthis collapses the distinction between meaning and truth and thus\ndestroys the possibility of making factual judgments. So the so-called\n\u201cdefinition\u201d has on some other basis to establish a\nconstancy in use of the sign.</p>", "<p>\nBut this is just what is in question. What would be <em>constancy</em>\nhere? What would <em>be</em> using the sign in the same way as before?\nHow <em>was</em> the sign used in the first place? As there cannot be\nassumed to be a way of using the sign which the linguist succeeds even\nin determining, let alone establishing, and which is the correct way,\nindependent of the linguist\u2019s later impression of the correct way,\nthen a defender of \u201cprivate language\u201d would have to show\nthat there was. It might now seem as if one could show this by\nappealing to the private linguist\u2019s memory. He simply remembers how he\nused the sign before. And this looks straightforward enough, because\none thinks: he certainly did something before, for he remembers it.\nAnd we do not require his memory to be infallible. But the memory does\nat least have to be a <em>memory</em>: that is, accurate or not, it\nhas to be of something determinate which existed independently of the\nmemory of it; and the \u201cmemory\u201d alone cannot bring such a\nthing into existence.</p>", "<p>\nThis is the argument of \u00a7265, which has often been mistakenly\ngiven an epistemological interpretation. Again we cannot assume that\nthere has been an actual table (even a mental one) of meanings in the\ncase of the private linguist, a table which is now recalled and about\nwhich the linguist must rely on recall since the original has gone.\nRather, as \u00a7\u00a7260\u2013264 show, there may be nothing\ndeterminate other than this \u201cremembering of the table\u201d. So\nwhen we think that a private linguist could remember the meaning of\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 by remembering a past correlation of the sign\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 with a sensation, we are supposing what needs\nto be itself established\u2014that there was indeed some independent\ncorrelation to be remembered. Fallibility of memory, even of memory of\nmeaning, is neither here nor there: the point is not that there is\ndoubt <em>now</em> about the trustworthiness of memory, but that there\nwas doubt <em>then</em> about the status of what occurred. And this\noriginal, <em>non</em>-epistemological, doubt cannot later be removed\nby \u201crecollections\u201d of a status inherently dubious in the\nfirst place. That is, if there was no genuine original correlation in\nthe first place, a \u201cmemory\u201d will not create one. But if,\nalternatively, we do not suppose that there was something independent\nof the memory to be remembered, again \u2018what seems right is\nright\u2019; the \u201cmemory\u201d of the\n\u201ccorrelation\u201d is being employed to confirm itself, for\nthere is no independent access to the \u201cremembered\ncorrelation\u201d. (Not even the independent access that we have as\nposers of the example, since the question is, can we pose such an\nexample? The typical mistake commentators make here is to disguise the\nproblem by thinking of <em>S</em> in terms of some already established\nconcept, such as <em> pain</em>, which they bring to the example\nthemselves.) This is why Wittgenstein says in \u00a7265, \u2018As if\nsomeone were to buy several copies of today\u2019s morning paper to assure\nhimself that what it said was true\u2019.</p>", "<h4>The Closing Stages</h4>", "<p>\nSo far the argument has been conducted in terms of an \u2018I\u2019\nnot essentially related to body or related only to an inert body. At\n\u00a7269, however, it moves to examples where there is bodily\nbehaviour but despite this there is still the temptation to think of\nprivate meanings for words independent of their public use. This\nsuggests a further chance for a defender of the idea of a private\nlanguage: that a private linguist might secure a meaning for his sign\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 by correlating its private use with some\npublic phenomenon. This would apparently serve to provide a function\nfor the noting of \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 in the diary (\u00a7260)\nand thus give a place for ostensive definition, and would give as well\na guarantee that there is some constancy in the linguist\u2019s use of the\nterm \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 independent of his impression of such\nconstancy. Wittgenstein uses the example of the manometer in\n\u00a7\u00a7270\u2013271 to consider this idea, and his criticism of\nit is in effect that this method of securing meaning works, but that\nthe secured meaning is public: the so-called \u201cprivate\nobject\u201d, even if there were such a thing, is revealed to be\nirrelevant to meaning. Presumably a defender of \u201cprivate\nlanguage\u201d would hope that the example would work like this: if I\nkeep saying, on the basis of my sensation, that my blood pressure is\nrising, and the manometer shows that I am right, then this success in\njudging my own blood pressure shows that I had in fact established a\nprivate meaning for the sign \u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 and was using\nthe sign in the same way each time to judge that my sensation was the\nsame each time. However, all the example really shows is that just\nthinking that I have the same sensation now as I had when my blood\npressure rose formerly, can be a good guide to the rising of my blood\npressure. Whether in some \u201cprivate sense\u201d the sensation\nwas \u201cactually the same\u201d or not becomes completely\nirrelevant to the question of constancy in the use of\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019\u2014that is, there is no gap between the\nactual nature of the sensation and my impression of it, and\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 in this case could mean merely\n\u2018sensation of the rising of the blood pressure\u2019; indeed,\nfor all we are told of the sign\u2019s role, it could even mean just\n\u2018blood pressure rising\u2019.</p>", "<p>\nDoes the ruling out of memory-scepticism as irrelevant to the private\nlanguage argument mean that two associated Orthodox objections to it\nare likewise irrelevant? The first of these is that the argument,\nself-defeatingly, rules out a public language as well. The second\nrelies on the \u2018community view\u2019 interpretation: it is that\nthe argument, equally self-defeatingly, rules out as impossible\nsomething perfectly conceivable: namely, the case of a so-called\n\u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019, a human being who, unlike Defoe\u2019s\noriginal Crusoe, is isolated from birth but devises a language for his\nown purposes without his having first been taught another language by\nsomeone else. Wittgenstein\u2019s Orthodox defenders, faced with this\nsecond objection, looked to be on shaky ground, often being forced\ninto the position of conceding that the argument did indeed exclude\nthe case, but claiming (not very plausibly) that such a Crusoe is\nafter all impossible so that the concession was not damaging.</p>", "<p>\nThe question as it concerns the first objection has already been\nanswered. The supposed threat to public language arose entirely from\nthe claim that memory-scepticism could not be confined to the private\ncase. But since scepticism concerning memory is no part of the\nargument, there is no reason to suppose that any question of such\nconfinement arises, and thus there is no question of the argument\u2019s\nbeing self-defeating by excluding the possibility of something we know\nto be actual, i.e., the language we already have. Now showing the\nabsence of any appeal to memory-scepticism involved transferring the\nburden of the argument from the question of whether or not an\nostensive definition could be remembered or not to the question of\nwhether there could be an ostensive definition in the first place.</p>", "<p>\nThis enables us to answer the question as it concerns the second\nobjection. It is clear that an argument which has as its focus the\nquestion of ostensive definition is not committed to ruling out in\nadvance all hypothetical cases of \u2018Robinson Crusoes\u2019. For\nthere is no <em>a priori</em> barrier to imagining a form of life\ncomplex enough for us to be assured that a determinate ostensive\ndefinition had been accomplished by such a being. Such a Crusoe,\nunlike a private linguist, lives in a world independent of his\nimpressions of it, and thus there could be definite occurrences in it\nwhich he could remember or forget; and some of those occurrences could\nbe correlations of signs with objects. It is easy to describe such\nhypothetical cases (a clear example appears in pages 486\u20138 of\nCanfield [1996]), and difficult to give a plausible denial that in\nsome sense they are possible. There are, however, further\ncomplications here, described briefly in section 4 below.</p>", "<p>\nThe Orthodox domination of the secondary literature on private\nlanguage was largely ended by Saul Kripke\u2019s account of Wittgenstein\u2019s\ntreatment of rules and private language, in which Wittgenstein appears\nas a sceptic concerning meaning. Kripke (p. 5) denies commitment to\nthe identity of this sceptical figure with its historical source, and,\nappropriately, his account has spawned a literature of its own in\nwhich discussion often proceeds largely independently of the original\nprivate language argument: Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein, real or fictional,\nhas become a philosopher in his own right, and for many people, it is\nnot an issue whether the historical Wittgenstein\u2019s original ideas\nabout private language are faithfully captured in this version. The\ncomplexities of the subsequent discussion of the\nphilosophical\u2014as opposed to interpretative\u2014questions\nraised by Kripke\u2019s Wittgenstein need a separate article to themselves.\n(For a survey, see Boghossian [1989].) All that will be settled here\nis the interpretative question.</p>", "<p>\nKripke\u2019s account resembles that given here in its rejection of\nOrthodoxy and in its emphasis on the logical priority of\nWittgenstein\u2019s discussion of rule-following to that of private\nlanguage. It differs in the prominence it gives to the opening\nsentence of <cite>Philosophical Investigations</cite> \u00a7201:\n\u2018This was our paradox: no course of action could be determined\nby a rule, because every course of action can be brought into accord\nwith the rule.\u2019 Kripke says of this (p. 68), \u2018The\nimpossibility of private language emerges as a corollary of\n[Wittgenstein\u2019s] sceptical solution of his own paradox\u2019.\nWittgenstein himself immediately brushed this \u201cparadox\u201d\naside in his very next paragraph: \u2018That there is a\nmisunderstanding here \u2026\u2019; but Kripke takes the paradox to\npose a genuine and profound sceptical problem about meaning.</p>", "<p>\nThe example Kripke chooses to illustrate the problem is that of\naddition. What is it to grasp the rule of addition? The application of\nthe rule is potentially infinite, and bizarre interpretations of the\nrule, as well as the standard use of it, are compatible with any\nfinite set of applications of the usual sort such as 7 + 14 = 21. So\nwhat is it which makes it true that when I say \u2018plus\u2019 I\nmean the usual addition function and not some other? Kripke (pp.\n62\u201371) understands this question as containing a Humean problem\nto which, he claims, Wittgenstein gives a Humean,\n\u2018sceptical\u2019 solution.</p>", "<p>\nWhat Kripke means by this comparison with a Humean problem is that\nWittgenstein is questioning the nexus between a past act of meaning\nand subsequent practice in a way analogous to that in which Hume\nquestions the causal nexus between a single past event and a\nsubsequent one. And what he means by a Humean solution is that there\nis a corresponding analogy between the ways in which Hume and\nWittgenstein handle their respective problems. Kripke\u2019s view is that,\njust as Hume says, in effect, \u201cUnique causation is\nunintelligible; <em>A</em>\u2019s causing <em>B</em> consists in\n<em>A</em>\u2019s being embedded in a pattern of the following of\n<em>A</em>-type-events by <em>B</em>-type-events which inclines us to\nassert that <em>A</em> caused <em>B</em>\u201d, so, comparably,\nWittgenstein says, in effect, \u201cUnique meaning is unintelligible;\nrather, someone\u2019s meaning the usual addition function when saying\n\u2018plus\u2019 consists in their being considered by a community\nto have passed the community\u2019s test for employing that\nfunction.\u201d</p>", "<p>\nKripke formulates the so-called Humean problem in two different\nways.</p>", "<p>\nThe first way is this: \u201c[T]here is no fact about me that\ndistinguishes my meaning a definite function by \u2018plus\u2019\n\u2026 and my meaning nothing at all\u201d (p. 21). The absence of\nthis fact, in Kripke\u2019s view, leads Wittgenstein to abandon the\nexplanation of the meanings of statements like \u201cBy\n\u2018plus\u2019, I meant addition\u201d in terms of\ntruth-conditions, and to replace it with explanation in terms of\nassertibility-conditions, which involve actual (not merely potential)\ncommunity agreement. (Hence the claim that this is a \u2018sceptical\nsolution\u2019: Wittgenstein is supposed to concede to the sceptic\nthe absence of truth-conditions for such statements.) This agreement,\non Kripke\u2019s account, legitimizes the assertion that I meant addition\nby \u2018plus\u2019 despite there having been no fact of the\nmatter.</p>", "<p>\nThis requirement of community agreement for meaning (the\n\u2018community view\u2019) obviously rules out the possibility of\nprivate language immediately, thereby rendering the argument of\n<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> \u00a7\u00a7256\u2013271\nsuperfluous. This superfluity makes for an odd reading of the text;\nand the oddness is highlighted by the observation that this first\nformulation of the sceptical problem relies on Kripke\u2019s assumption\nthat we have some idea of what a fact is, independent of a statement\u2019s\nbeing true. For one of the themes of <cite>Philosophical\nInvestigations</cite> is that there is no such idea, that the only\nroute to the identification of facts is through the uses of the\nexpressions in which those facts are stated, uses which give us the\ntruth-conditions. These uses are often very different from what we\nwould expect\u2014hence the impression that truth-conditions are\nlacking\u2014and it is a matter of some philosophical difficulty to\nsee them clearly.</p>", "<p>\nThe other formulation of the problem is this (Kripke p. 62):\n\u201cWittgenstein questions the nexus between past\n\u2018intention\u2019 or \u2018meanings\u2019 and present\npractice: for example, between my past \u2018intentions\u2019 with\nregard to \u2018plus\u2019 and my present computation \u2026\n.\u201d The idea is that my grasp of the rule governing the use of\n\u2018plus\u2019 does not determine that I shall produce a unique\nanswer for each of indefinitely many new additions in the future. The\nimpression that something is missing here, though, is a result of just\nthat kind of confusion about determination identified in the section\nheaded \u2018The Significance of the Issue\u2019 above.</p>", "<p>\nKripke\u2019s account of the private language argument is thus vitiated by\nhis unargued reliance on ideas which Wittgenstein argued against. This\nof course does not show that he has not hit upon a new and more\ninteresting notion of private language than that expounded here.\nFurther, his reading of the argument gave new life to the debate over\nthe community view.</p>", "<p>\nAlthough, as was just said, the community view is not easily\nreconciled with part of Wittgenstein\u2019s text, the matter is less clear\nthan has been indicated so far. Significantly, even the most careful,\ninsightful and sympathetic of Wittgenstein\u2019s commentators have divided\non this matter (for example, Malcolm for the community view, and Baker\nand Hacker against it). The dispute is partly explained by the fact\nthat the original texts (including some from Wittgenstein\u2019s\nmanuscripts) seem to point two ways, some supporting the account given\nabove (that the burden of the argument is that language must be\npotentially social), others the community view that language is\nessentially social.</p>", "<p>\nThat is, textual support can be found for two apparently conflicting\nexegetical claims:</p>", "<ol>\n\n<li>Language is essentially social. </li>\n\n<li>It is conceptually (even if not psychologically) possible that a\nlifelong Crusoe (i.e., a human being isolated from birth) should\nemploy some kind of linguistic system and follow rules in so\ndoing.</li>\n</ol>", "<p>\nAnd the contending parties share the assumption that the conflict is\ngenuine.</p>", "<p>\nThere is, however, reason to believe that this assumption is false,\nfor investigation of Wittgenstein\u2019s notions of <em>essential</em>,\n<em>possible</em> and <em>lifelong Crusoe</em> shows that admission of\nthe first claim does not commit him to the denial of the second. To\ntake the first notion: on Wittgenstein\u2019s view, while chess is\nessentially a game for two players, this does not exclude the\npossibility of playing it against oneself provided such solitary games\nare not regarded as paradigm instances of chess. Similarly, he can\nclaim that language is essentially social, but still allow the\npossibility of exceptions provided these are peripheral cases. The\nissue is complex, and its pursuit would lead away from the current\narticle\u2019s purpose of articulating the central text.

In contrast, the state of affairs that\nSocrates is foolish exists, even if Socrates is not foolish (see\nReinach 1911; Wittgenstein 1918: 2.04, 2.05; Plantinga 1974: 44;\nPollock 1984a: 52).</p>", "<p>\n(3) distinguishes states of affairs from thoughts:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n[States of affairs] are \u201cabout\u201d objects but not in terms\nof some mode of representation.

They are the same state\nof affairs under different names. However, I can believe that Marilyn\nMonroe is an actress while doubting that Norma Jean Baker is an\nactress. Hence, if there are states of affairs, they are not the\ncontent of propositional attitudes like belief; thoughts are. This\npoint leaves open the possibility that a state of affairs is a set of\nthoughts that are equivalent in some respect (see\n <a href=\"#StatAffaFundBearModaProp\">section 2.2</a>).</p>", "<p>\nThe model of a space of possible outcomes of a throw of a die gives us\nan initial idea of what the distinctive properties of state of affairs\nare and why it is plausible to assume that there are any states of\naffairs. It leaves questions about the precise nature of states of\naffairs open. For example, Wittgenstein (1918: 4.26) argued that only\nelementary sentences \u201cpicture\u201d states of affairs. An\nelementary sentence in Wittgenstein\u2019s sense is a concatenation\nof simple proper names each of which refers to a simple object. The\nnames in the elementary proposition are arranged in a way that can be\nmapped onto an arrangement of the simple objects named. This\narrangement of objects is the state of affairs pictured by the\nelementary sentence. Nothing said so far rules out that states of\naffairs that involve some objects and properties (relations) combine\nto form further complex states of affairs that have states of affairs\nas constituents. (Pollock 1984a: 55\u20136) defines negation,\nconjunction etc. for states of affairs. For example, if there is a\nstate of affairs \\(S_1\\) and a state of affairs \\(S_2\\), their\nconjunction is the state of affairs that obtains if, and only if, both\n\\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) obtain. If one wants to restrict the space of\npossible states to combinations of simple objects, one needs to\nmarshal arguments that show that this and similar conceptions of\ncomplex states of affairs is flawed. (This entry is mainly concerned\nwith simple states of affairs.)</p>", "<p>\nSimilarly, the model of states of affairs as possible outcomes does\nnot rule out that there are impossible state of affairs.

Thoughts are also truth-value bearers (\u201cThere are three\n<em>truths</em> that everyone who works in elementary physics\nbelieves\u201d). How are thoughts related to states of affairs? For\ninstance, how is the thought that Socrates is wise related to the\nstate of affairs  <em>Socrates\u2019 being wise</em>?</p>", "<p>\n<em>Prima facie</em>, thoughts are one thing, states of affairs\nanother.

If one can <i>j</i>\nthat <i>p</i> without <em>eo ipso</em> <i>j</i>-ing that <i>q</i> (and\n<em>vice versa</em>), the contents that <i>p</i> and that <i>q</i> are\ndifferent. Now I can believe, for instance, that Hesperus shines\nwithout believing that Phosphorus shines. Hence, if thoughts are the\ncontents of propositional attitudes, the thought that Hesperus shines\nis different from the thought that Phosphorus shines. If the thought\nthat Hesperus shines is different from the thought that Phosphorus\nshines, thoughts cannot be logical complexes whose constituents are\nparticulars and properties. Following Frege, many philosophers\ntherefore take thoughts to be complexes that are built up out of modes\nof presentations. Here \u201cthoughts\u201d only refers to such\ncomplexes. Since there are different modes of presentations of the\nsame particular (property), there can be different thoughts that\nconcern or are about the same particulars and properties. In contrast,\n<em>Hesperus\u2019s shining</em> and <em>Phosphorus\u2019s\nshining</em> are the same state of affairs, namely the complex that\ncontains only the planet Venus and the property of shining. We will\nsee in\n <a href=\"#StatAffaPropAtti\">section 2.4</a>\n that not all philosophers follow Frege\u2019s lead.

Standard accounts of modes of presentation allow for the\nexistence of modes of presentations that are empty.

For example, the thought that Pegasus is a\nhorse exists, although there is no such horse (for defense and\nelaboration see Sainsbury 2005: 86\u20139). This is different for\nstates of affairs. If a state of affairs is a complex that contains\nobjects and properties as constituents, it cannot exist if its\nconstituents don\u2019t exist. So while it is true that Pegasus does\nnot exist, there is no such state of affairs. This is unproblematic\nfor we have not been given any reason to think that such a state of\naffairs obtains or does not obtain.

A\nsingular proposition is supposed to be (i) \u201cdirectly\nabout\u201d an object and (ii) evaluable as true or false.

If one combines (i) and (ii) with the\nplausible assumption that the proposition that Superman does not exist\nis singular and true, one arrives at the conclusion that Superman\nexists. Similar problems arise for negative modal existential singular\npropositions such as the proposition that Socrates might not have\nexisted. Williamson 2002 argues on the basis of these problems that\neverything exists necessarily.

Fregean truth-values are also unsuited. According to\nFrege\u2019s semantics for assertoric sentences, every true (false)\nsentence, whether necessary or contingently true, refers to the True\n(the False).

If one lets sentences stand for or describe state of affairs\nwhose constituents are the referents of the semantically relevant\nsentence parts, one can capture this similarity: (1a) and (1b) ((2a)\nand (2b)) have the same modal status because these sentences stand for\nthe same state of affairs (Forbes 1989: 131). In general, sentences\nthat stand for the same state of affairs have the same modal value. It\nis then a short step to take states of affairs to be the primary or\nfundamental bearers of modal status (1989: 131\u20132).

If we drop the restriction to true\npropositions and simplify Vendler\u2019s idea, we can propose that a\nstate of affairs is a set of referentially equivalent thoughts,\nwhether they are true or not.

There are no impossible worlds.\nThe actual world is the world in which we are located.</p>", "<p>\nAccording to Abstractionists, possible worlds are abstract objects of\nsome sort. The exercise in probability calculation from\n <a href=\"#TheoRoleForStatAffa\">section 1.2</a>\n motivates an Abstractionist proposal in which states of affairs are\nthe basic building blocks. States of affairs are possible outcomes.\nKripke called possible outcomes \u201cminiature possible\nworlds\u201d. This suggests an idea of what a possible world is: it\nis a <em>maximal</em> state of affairs. Pollock (1984a: 57) defines\npossible world therefore as follows:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<ul class=\"sentag tag3em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(PW)</span><span class=\"sen\"> <i>w</i> is a\npossible world if, and only if, <i>w</i> is a nontransient possible\nstate of affairs and for any nontransient state of affairs <i>S</i> if\nit is possible that <i>w</i> and <i>S</i> both obtain, <i>w</i>\nincludes <i>S</i>.

The\nactual world is the possible maximal nontransient state of affairs\nthat obtains.</p>", "<p>\nA state of affairs is transient if, and only if, it obtains at one\ntime and not another. For instance, the state of affairs\n<em>Socrates\u2019s not drinking hemlock</em> obtains at some times,\nbut not at others. Transient states of affairs are only possible,\nactual etc.  relative to a time. Before 399 BC it was possible that\nSocrates does not drink hemlock, but this is no longer possible after\n399 BC. A state of affairs is nontransient if, and only, if it is such\nthat necessarily if it obtains at one time it obtains at all\ntimes. For example, the state of affairs <em>Socrates\u2019s being\nhungry on the 15<sup>th</sup> of April 400 BC at 16:15</em> is\nnontransient.</p>", "<p>\n(PW) makes use of modal concepts to define possible world: it must be\n<em>possible</em> for <i>S</i> and <i>w</i> to both obtain etc. Hence,\nthis particular Abstractionist conception of possible worlds does not\nallow one to explain modality away; it presupposes it. In contrast,\nthe Concretist conception promises a definitional reduction of modal\nconcepts. When we talk about possibility and necessity we quantify\nover mereological sums of things. The concept of modality is not\nrequired to distinguish between possible and impossible worlds: there\nare no impossible ones. Why is (PW), then, attractive?</p>", "<p>\n<em>First</em>, Forbes (1987: 139ff) argues that the identification of\npossible worlds with constructions out of compossible states of\naffairs solves the problem of accidental intrinsics (Lewis 1986:\n199\u2013201). Let us consider an intrinsic property of a human\nbeing, say me, such as <em>having two hands</em>. I might have existed\nwithout having had two hands. On the concretist account this implies\nthat there is a possible world in which I have a different number of\nhands. But how can one and the same individual have two as well as\nless/more hands \u201cin different worlds\u201d? If the worlds are\nmereological sums that have me as a common part, this seems not\npossible. Lewis concludes that the same object cannot be part of\ndifferent possible worlds. An object can only be in different possible\nworlds by having counterparts in them.</p>", "<p>\nAccording to counterpart theory, I might have had three hands only in\nthe derived sense by having counter-parts that have three hands (see\nKripke 1980: 45). This does not sit well with the intuition that\n<i>I</i> strictly and literally speaking might have had three hands.\nThe identification of possible worlds with constructions out of\ncompossible states of affairs is faithful to this intuition. I have\ndifferent properties in different possible worlds, if the possible\nworlds contain different states of affairs that involve me. One\npossible world contains the state of affairs <em>MT\u2019s having\nthree hands</em>; the possible world that is actual contains the state of\naffairs <em>MT\u2019s having two hands</em>. The different possible worlds\nunder discussion don\u2019t overlap, yet the possibilities involve me\n(see Forbes 1987: 141).</p>", "<p>\n<em>Second</em>, the semantics of counterfactuals. The so-called\n\u201cStalnaker-Lewis semantics\u201d for counterfactuals assumes\nthat a counterfactual such as \u201cIf it were rainy today, I would\ntake an umbrella\u201d is true if, and only if, all of the closest\npossible worlds in which the antecedent is true are possible worlds in\nwhich the consequent is true. This semantics for counterfactuals\nallows the substitution of logically equivalent sentences in the\nantecedent of a counterfactual. For example, if the counterfactual\n\u201cIf it were rainy today, I would take an umbrella\u201d is\ntrue, so is \u201cIf it were rainy and windy today or rainy and not\nwindy today, I would take an umbrella\u201d because \u201cIt is\nrainy today\u201d and \u201cIf it is rainy and windy today or rainy\nand not windy today\u201d are true in the same possible worlds. Fine\n(1975: 453f; 2012: 230f) argues that the substitution principle should\nbe given up in the light of puzzling consequences. But certainly one\ncan substitute some sentences in the antecedent of a counterfactual.\nWhich ones? Fine suggests replacing Stalnaker-Lewis semantics for\ncounterfactuals with a semantics in which possible states take pride\nof place. Instead of a plurality of possible worlds there is a space\nof possible states that involve particulars and ways they can be.\nAssertoric sentences refer to states of affairs and only those\nsentences that refer to the same state of affairs can be substituted\nin the antecedent of a counter-factual (Fine 1975: 454).</p>", "<p>\nFine assumes that \u201cIt is rainy\u201d, \u201cIt is rainy and\nwindy\u201d and \u201cIt is rainy and not windy\u201d etc. refer to\ndifferent states of affairs (1975: 454). How can this assumption be\njustified? If we take the idea that states of affairs are complexes\nseriously, we can answer this question. Just like other complexes they\ncan (at least in part) be individuated in terms of their constituents.\nThe states of affairs \\(S_1\\) and \\(S_2\\) can therefore only be the\nsame state of affairs if they have the same constituents. This\nconception allows for states of affairs that necessarily co-obtain,\nbut differ. For example, necessarily, the state of affairs that\ntriangle <i>A</i> is equilateral obtains if the state of affairs that\ntriangle <i>A</i> is equiangular and <em>vice versa</em>. Similarly,\nthe state of affairs <i>P</i> necessarily obtains if, and only if,\nthe state of affairs \\(P \\mathbin{\\&amp;} (Q \\lor \\neg Q)\\) obtains.\nYet, these are different states of affairs: they have different\nconstituents.</p>", "<p>\nThis conception of states of affairs as complexes makes them useful\nfor semantics. If sentences refer to such states of affairs, logically\nequivalent sentences can refer to different states of affairs and\ntherefore have different semantic properties. All tautologies are true\nin all possible worlds, yet they can refer to different states of\naffairs. A number of semantic theories assume that sentences refer to\nstates of affairs. These theories provide principles that determine\nthe reference of complex sentences on the basis of their parts (see\nFine 2012: 234; see also Rumfitt 2015: 160\u20137).</p>", "<p>\nHowever, if states of affairs are individuated in terms of their\ncomponents and their mode of combination, there are for every possible\nworld many different maximal nontransient states of affairs (for the\nfollowing see Zalta 1993: 393\u20134). If the state of affairs\n<i>P</i> is a possible world, so is \\(P \\mathbin{\\&amp;} (Q\\lor \\neg\nQ)\\) for an arbitrarily chosen possible state of affairs <i>Q</i>.\n<i>P</i> and \\(P \\mathbin{\\&amp;} (Q\\lor \\neg Q)\\) are necessarily\nequivalent, but, according to our individuation method, different\nstates of affairs. Hence, there are many different maximal states of\naffairs that correspond to the same possible world and, in particular,\nto the actual world.</p>", "<p>\nZalta (1993) tackles this problem on the basis of his axiomatic theory\nof abstract objects. According to him, abstract objects like numbers\nexemplify but also encode properties. For example, 1 encodes the\nproperties that are essential to its identity; to its being the object\nit is. In contrast, 1 exemplifies, but does not encode, the property\nof being the number of inhabited planets of the solar system. In this\nsystem, situations are those abstract objects that encode state of\naffairs properties such as <em>being such that John is to the left of\nHarry</em>. If a situation is the case, the state of affairs\nproperties it encodes obtain; the situation makes the encoded state of\naffairs property factual. A situation <i>S</i> is a possible world if,\nand only if, it is possible that <i>S</i> makes all and only the\nobtaining states of affairs properties factual. On the basis of the\naxioms of his system Zalta can show that there is a unique actual\nworld.</p>", "<p>\nIf one is unwilling to make a distinction between encoding and\nexemplifying, but one wants to maintain the identification of possible\nworlds with maximal possible states of affairs, one either has to\naccept that necessarily equivalent states of affairs are the same or\none must identify possible worlds with sets of necessarily equivalent\npossible states of affairs. We already rejected the first option as\nunfruitful for semantics. The second option seems to result in a\nset-theoretic modeling or replacement of possible worlds, not in a\nconception of possible worlds (see Zalta 1993: 394).</p>", "<p>\nThoughts can\u2019t fulfill the role of states of affairs as the\nfundamental bearers of modal properties. Can states of affairs be the\ncontents of propositional attitudes? <em>Prima facie</em>, the answer\nis <em>No</em>. We have already seen that states of affairs are too\ncoarse-grained to be the contents of propositional attitudes. I can\nbelieve that Hesperus is a planet, without believing that Phosphorus\nis a planet (and vice versa). Hence, the contents of the attitudes\ndiffer. But the state of affairs <em>Hesperus\u2019s being a\nplanet</em> is just the state of affairs <em>Phosphorus\u2019s\nbeing a planet</em>. Propositional attitudes are, at best, mediated\nrelations to states of affairs. For example, a belief represents a\nstate of affairs if, and only if, the believer assents to a thought\nthat describes a state of affairs.</p>", "<p>\nBarcan Marcus has challenged this view. She argued that belief is\n\u201ca relation between a subject or agent and a state of affairs\nthat is not necessarily actual but that has actual objects as its\nconstituents\u201d (Barcan Marcus 1993 [1990]: 240). Her\nobject-centered account of belief identifies belief with a\ndifferential disposition to a state of affairs:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n<i>x</i> believes that <i>S</i> just in case, under certain\n<em>agent-centered circumstances including</em> <i>x</i>\u2019s\ndesires and needs as well as <em>external circumstances</em>, <i>x</i>\nis disposed to act as if <i>S</i>, that actual or nonactual state of\naffairs, obtains. (Barcan Marcus 1993 [1990]: 241)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nBelieving that so-and-so does not require concept possession. For\nexample, believing that the sun is shining is a differential\ndisposition to the state of affairs <em>the sun\u2019s\nshining</em>, however described or presented.</p>", "<p>\nThe object-centered account of belief contrasts with\nmode-of-presentation-centered or language-centered accounts. The\nobject-centered theory allows us to take belief-ascriptions to\nnon-linguistic creatures to be literally true. However, it runs into\nproblems when it comes to assertoric utterances of sentences\ncontaining empty singular terms. According to the object-centred view,\nthese don\u2019t express beliefs (see Barcan Marcus 1993 [1990]:\n247). While the state of affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being\n<i>F</i></em> can exist, although <i>a</i> is not <i>F</i>; it cannot\nexist, if either <i>a</i> or <em>being <i>F</i></em> doesn\u2019t\nexist. Now take the belief that Napoleon was French. I satisfy all\nintuitive criteria for the possession of this belief. Imagine that we\nfind out that, after all, there was never such a person as Napoleon.\nIt was all a very elaborate hoax. Then there is no state of affairs\ncomposed of Napoleon and <em>being French</em>. Hence, although all\nintuitive criteria may have told us that I believed that Napoleon was\nFrench, we now find out that I never had that belief. This is\ncounter-intuitive and artificial.</p>", "<p>\nTo sum up: Thoughts and states of affairs are different things.\nThoughts cannot be reduced to states of affairs and the reduction of\nstates of affairs to sets of referentially equivalent thoughts is\nunwarranted. We need both thoughts and states of affairs in order to\nfulfill different roles.</p>", "<p>\nWhat are facts and how may they be distinguished from states of\naffairs?</p>", "<p>\nThe Truthmaker-Argument is the main argument for the introduction of\nfacts (see Armstrong 1997: 115ff). It also yields an understanding of\nthe main features of facts. The argument can be summed up as\nfollows:</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag3em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(P1)</span><span class=\"sen\"> Every truth must\nhave a truth-maker.</span></li>\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\"> (P2) </span><span class=\"sen\"> The best\ncandidates to occupy the truth-maker role are facts. </span></li>\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\"> (C) </span><span class=\"sen\"> There are facts.\n</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nArmstrong takes (P1) to articulate the following intuitive asymmetry:\nIt is true that Socrates is wise <em>because</em> Socrates is wise;\nbut Socrates is not wise <em>because</em> it is true that Socrates is\nwise (see Armstrong 2004: 4). In Armstrong\u2019s terminology a\ntruth-bearer is <em>true in virtue of</em> (<em>made true by</em>) the\nexistence of another entity, a truth-maker. A truth-maker ensures or\nguarantees the truth of a truth-bearer. Some authors take this\nguarantee to be a form of necessitation: <i>x</i> makes it true that\n<i>p</i> if, and only if, necessarily, if <i>x</i> exists, it is true\nthat <i>p</i>.</p>", "<p>\nThis brings us to the second premise of the Truthmaker-Argument. Why\nare facts the best candidates for the truth-maker role? Let us work\nthrough some alternatives. Take the thought that Socrates is wise. The\nexistence of which object necessitates its truth? Socrates can exist\nwithout being wise. Hence, <em>Socrates</em> is not the truth-maker we\nare looking for.</p>", "<p>\nThe last point suggests that only a complex entity that\n\u201ccontains\u201d Socrates as well as the property of <em>being\nwise</em> is a candidate for the truth-maker role. The mereological\nsum of Socrates and <em>being wise</em>, that is, the whole that has\nonly Socrates and wisdom as parts, satisfies this condition, yet it\ncannot fulfill the truth-maker role. If Socrates and wisdom exist,\ntheir mereological sum exists. Hence, the sum exists whether it is\ntrue that Socrates is wise or not. For similar reasons the set that\ncontains only Socrates and <em>being wise</em> cannot be the\ntruth-maker of the thought that Socrates is wise. Armstrong concludes\nthat only the fact that Socrates is wise that \u201cties\u201d Socrates and <em>being wise</em>\nmakes it true that Socrates is wise (see Armstrong 1997: 118).</p>", "<p>\nArmstrong\u2019s conception of truthmaking is controversial (see, for\ninstance, Restall 1996). I will set its problems aside here and focus\non clarifying the relation between facts and states of affairs. Facts\n\u201ctie\u201d particulars and universals. This brings them close\nto states of affairs that also involve particulars and universals.\nWhat distinguishes them is that the existence of a fact is supposed to\nguarantee the truth of a truth-bearer. The existence of the fact that <i>a</i> is <i>F</i>\ncan only guarantee the truth\nof the thought that <i>a</i> is <i>F</i> if one cannot distinguish\nfacts into those that obtain and those that do not obtain. Saying of\nthe fact that Socrates is wise that it obtains is redundant, while it\nis not redundant to say so of the state of affairs <em>Socrates\u2019 being wise</em>.</p>", "<p>\nFacts are also introduced in order to stop a regress of instantiation.\nTake the particular <i>a</i> and the property of <em>being</em>\n<i>F</i> and assume that they can exist independently of each other.\nGiven this assumption, there must be a relation that\n\u201cties\u201d them together to <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being\n<i>F</i></em>. If the required \u201ctie\u201d is a genuine\nrelation, a regress, usually called <em>Bradley\u2019s regress</em>,\nensues: we need to introduce another relation that ties the first\nrelation to <i>a</i> and being <i>F</i>, and so on. Facts are supposed\nto prevent Bradley\u2019s regress (see Armstrong 1997: 115 and 118;\nHossack 2007: 33). How? Relations that tie particulars and properties\ntogether are \u201cexplained away\u201d in terms of facts that\ncontain particulars and properties: if <i>a</i> instantiates\n<i>F</i>-ness, it does so <em>because</em> the fact that <i>a</i> is\n<i>F</i> exists. The existence of this fact guarantees that <i>a</i>\nis <i>F</i>. Facts are just instantiations of universals by\nparticulars (see Armstrong 1997: 119). Hence, we arrive again at the\nresult that the obtaining/non-obtaining distinction does not apply to\nfacts.</p>", "<p>\nIn contrast to facts the obtaining/non-obtaining distinction divides\nstates of affairs into those that obtain and those that do not obtain\n(see\n <a href=\"#IntrStatAffa\">section 1</a>).\n For this reason states of affairs cannot be truthmakers: their\nexistence does not necessitate the truth of a truth-bearer. The state\nof affairs <em>Socrates\u2019 being foolish</em> exists in some\npossible worlds in which Socrates is foolish, but it also exists in\npossible worlds in which Socrates is not foolish. Valicella reinforces\nthis point:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n[Facts] are not to be confused with abstract states of affairs which\neither obtain or do not obtain depending on how the world is. The\nlatter are themselves in need of something in the world that explains\nwhy they obtain. (Valicella 2000: 237)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nStates of affairs contain particulars and properties; facts tie them.\nThis similarity encourages the question whether a fact is nothing but\na state of affairs <em>that obtains</em> (see Horwich 1990: 113 who\ntakes true Russellian propositions to be facts). On this view the\nreason why it is redundant to say that a fact obtains is that a fact\nis just an obtaining state of affairs. However, the identification of\nfacts with obtaining states of affairs creates problems for the theory\nof truthmaking. Assume that the fact that Socrates is wise is just the\nobtaining state of affairs <em>Socrates\u2019 being wise</em>. The\nfact is supposed to make it true that Socrates is wise. But if the\nfact is just the obtaining state of affairs <em>Socrates\u2019\nbeing wise</em>, we need in turn something that explains why the state\nof affairs obtains.  For it seems correct to say \u201cThe state of\naffairs <em>Socrates\u2019 being wise</em> obtains because\nSocrates is wise\u201d, but not \u201cSocrates is wise because the\nstate of affairs <em>Socrates\u2019 being wise</em>\nobtains\u201d. Hence, obtaining states of affairs cannot play the\nsame role as facts. They cannot be truth-makers. The question\n\u201cWhy is it true that Socrates is wise?\u201d cannot\nbe <em>conclusively</em> answered by saying \u201cBecause\n<em>Socrates\u2019 being wise</em> obtains\u201d. This answer is in\nneed of a further explanation of the same type as the one we were\noriginally after.</p>", "<p>\nA non-obtaining state of affairs cannot be a fact. But can every state\nof affairs be a recombination of particulars and properties that are\ncombined in some facts? Combinatorialists answer Yes (see, for\nexample, Skyrms 1981; Armstrong 1989: 45ff; Bigelow 1988; Forbes 1989:\n137). This idea has two main varieties:</p>", "<div class=\"indent\">\n\n<p>\n<em>Fictionalism</em>: Like ideal gases or frictionless surfaces,\npossible states of affairs are (useful) fictions; only facts exist.\nAssume that <i>a</i> is not <i>F</i>. There exists no possible state\nof affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being <i>F</i></em>. But there is\nthe fiction of possible states of affairs according to which there is\nthe state of affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being <i>F</i></em> if,\nand only if, <i>a</i> and <em>being <i>F</i></em> are contained in\nsome facts (see Armstrong 1989: 46 and 49ff and the entry on\n <a href=\"../fictionalism-modal/\">modal fictionalism</a>\n for a detailed overview).</p>\n\n<p>\n<em>Representationalism</em>: there are no possible states of affairs,\nonly representations of possible states of affairs (see Lewis 1986:\n146 who ascribes this view to Skyrms). These representations are\nset-theoretic constructs that contain as their members particulars and\nuniversals that occur in some facts. For example, if\n<em><i>a</i>\u2019s being <i>F</i></em> and <em><i>b</i>\u2019s\nbeing <i>G</i></em> are both facts, but the sentence \u201c<i>a</i>\nis <i>G</i>\u201d is false, there is no state of affairs\n<em><i>a</i>\u2019s being <i>G</i></em>, but there is an ordered-pair\nthat contains <i>a</i> and <em>being <i>G</i> as</em> its members.</p>\n</div>", "<p>\nRepresentationalism raises the question: what distinguishes a\n(possible) state of affairs from a mere representation of it? Why is\nthe state of affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being <i>G</i></em> not\nsimply the ordered pair of <i>a</i> and <em>being <i>G</i></em>? We\nwill come back to this question in\n <a href=\"#UnitStatAffa\">section 5</a>.</p>", "<p>\nIn the previous sections we have seen that states of affairs are of\nvalue if the necessarily co-obtaining states of affairs are distinct.\nThis gives us a reason to reject Chisholm\u2019s (1976: 118) thesis\nthat necessarily co-obtaining states of affairs are identical. At the\nsame time it puts weight on the characterization of states of affairs\nas \u201cinvolving\u201d objects and properties or as composed out\nof objects and properties. It seems intuitively plausible that the\nstate of affairs <em>Socrates\u2019s being wise</em> involves\nSocrates and the property of being wise. But in what way do states of\naffairs involve particulars and properties?</p>", "<p>\nOrdered n-tuples have members. Are states of affairs n-tuples that\nhave objects and properties as members? Is, for example, the state of\naffairs <em>Socrates\u2019s being wise</em> nothing but the ordered pair\n\\(\\langle\\)Socrates, being wise\\(\\rangle\\)? Plantinga answers NO:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nClearly there are many set-theoretical models of our talk about states\nof affairs and individuals. Why pick any of them as more revealing\nthan the others? (Plantinga 1984: 327)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nWe can model states of affairs as ordered n-tuples in many different\nways.

Hence, the state of\naffairs is not identical with either ordered pair (see Pollock 1984b:\n138).</p>", "<p>\nSome philosophers spell out \u201cinvolvement\u201d as containment:\nA state of affairs is a complex that contains properties and\nparticulars as <em>parts</em>. In order to assess this proposal, let\nus first sharpen our understanding of the part-of relation. Any\nrelation worthy of the name \u201c(proper) part-of\u201d must be\nreflexive (everything is part of itself), transitive (if <i>x</i> is a\npart of <i>y</i> and <i>z</i> a part of <i>x</i>, <i>z</i> is a part\nof <i>y</i>) and antisymmetrical (if <i>x</i> is part of <i>y</i> and\n<i>y</i> part of <i>x</i>, <i>x</i> is identical to <i>y</i>) (see the\nentry on\n <a href=\"../mereology/\">mereology</a>,\n sect. 2 and 3). A further plausible principle for the part-of\nrelation is the supplementation principle: if <i>x</i> is not part of\n<i>y</i>, there is an object <i>z</i> that is part of <i>y</i> and\nthat does overlap, that is, have a part in common, with <i>y</i>. The\nsupplementation principle implies the intuitively plausible view that\nnothing can have a single proper part. The supplementation principle\ntogether with the uncontroversial axioms for the (proper) part-of\nrelation also implies the more controversial thesis that complex\nobjects with the same parts are identical (see entry on\n <a href=\"../mereology/\">mereology</a>,\n 3.2).</p>", "<p>\nThe transitivity of part-of immediately gives rise to problems. For\ninstance, Frege wrote to Wittgenstein:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n[If Vesuvius is part of a state of affairs,] it seems that parts of\nVesuvius must also be parts of this fact; the fact will hence also\nconsist of solidified lava.

If the state of affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being\n<i>F</i></em> has only <i>a</i> and <em>being <i>F</i></em> as its\nparts (in any plausible sense of \u201cpart\u201d), it can only\nexist at a time at which <i>a</i> and <em>being <i>F</i></em> exist\n(the sum of all my body parts exists only at the time when all my body\nparts exist). Hence, the state of affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s</em>\nceasing to exist before <em>b\u2019s</em> starting to exist cannot be\na complex containing <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>. For there is no time when\nits constituents both exist (see K\u00fcnne 2003: 122).</p>", "<p>\nThe principles for the (proper) part-of relation imply that complexes\nwith the same parts are identical. But take the state of affairs that\nRomeo loves Juliet. If it has Romeo, Love and Juliet as its parts, it\nis the same as the state of affairs that Juliet loves Romeo. But\nintuitively, the state of affairs <em>Juliet\u2019s loving\nRomeo</em> is different from the state of affairs <em>Romeo\u2019s\nloving Juliet</em>. On the standard mereological conception of part,\nparticulars and universals are not parts of states of affairs.</p>", "<p>\nThe last point cuts both ways. Why not say that different complex\nobjects can have the same parts? Armstrong (1997: 118) answered this\nquestion positively and argued that facts are non-mereological\ncomposites. Lewis has denied that there is room for non-mereological\ncomposition (see Lewis 1992: 213; for discussion McDaniel 2009).\nHowever, independently of considerations about states of affairs we\nallow for different wholes that share all their parts. For instance,\nthe sentences \u201cJohn loves Mary\u201d and \u201cMary loves\nJohn\u201d both consist of the same words \u201cJohn\u201d,\n\u201cMary\u201d and \u201cloves\u201d, yet they are clearly\ndifferent sentences.</p>", "<p>\nBut our intuitive notion does not allow for wholes without remainder:\nif something <i>x</i> is part of a whole <i>W</i>, there is a\nremainder of <i>W</i> that is not identical with <i>x</i>. The\nremainder principle is implied by the supplementation principle of\nmereology, but not the other way around (see\n <a href=\"../mereology/\">mereology</a>\n entry, sect. 3.2) Hence, we can draw on the remainder principle\nwithout endorsing the stronger supplementation principle. Now there\nseem to be states of affairs that \u201ccontain\u201d only one\nproperty (Bynoe 2011 argues the following point in detail). Bradley's\nRegress which was discussed in\n <a href=\"#FactTrutMakeRegrStop\">section 3.1</a> seems to show that\n the state of affairs <em>Socrates\u2019 being wise</em> consists\n only of Socrates and <em>being wise</em>. There is no relation that\n ties them to a state of affairs. Otherwise the question would arise\n what relates this relation to Socrates and <em>being wise</em>. Now\n some properties instantiate themselves: identity is\n self-identical. Hence, the state of affairs <em>identity\u2019s\n being self-identical</em> obtains. But this state of affairs contains\n only the property of identity. There seems to be no plausible sense\n of \u201cpart\u201d in which such states of affairs have parts.</p>", "<p>\nWe are back then to the problem of how to make sense of how a state of\naffairs involves properties and particulars. In order to solve it, we\nneed to find a relation between the state of affairs\n<em><i>a</i>\u2019s being <i>F</i></em> and <i>a</i> and <em>being\n<i>F</i></em> that (i) does not make <i>a</i> and <em>being <i>F</i>\nparts</em> of the state of affairs, (ii) allows one to distinguish\nbetween necessarily co-obtaining states of affairs, and (iii)\ndistinguishes the state of affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being\n<i>F</i></em> from other objects that, intuitively speaking, involve\n<i>a</i> and <em>being <i>F</i></em>.</p>", "<p>\nFine (1982: 51\u20132) has suggested an answer that invokes the\nindependently motivated idea that the identity of some objects is\nexplained in terms of the identity of other objects (see also Fine\n1995; Bynoe 2011: 99\u2013100; and Keller 2013: 669). Consider\nFine\u2019s example of the singleton of 1. The singleton of 1 is the\nset whose sole member is 1. The singleton of 1 is ontologically\ndependent on 1 because its identity depends on the identity of 1. We\nexplain what the singleton is by appealing to 1, but not the other way\naround. Similarly, the identity of (atomic) states of affairs is\nexplained in terms of objects and properties. Fine (1982: 52) takes\nbasic states of affairs\u2014<em>propositions</em> in his\nterminology\u2014to be the results of the application of the\noperation of predication to particulars and properties. We say what\nthe state of affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being <i>F</i></em> is by\nsaying that it is the result of predicating <em>being <i>F</i></em> to\n<i>a</i>. Hence, the state of affairs  <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being\n<i>F</i></em> depends on <em>being <i>F</i></em> to <em>a.</em>\nComplex states of affairs are the result of the application of such\noperations as conjunction and disjunction to basic states of affairs\n(on Operationalism as a general approach see Fine 2010: 564ff). The\nnotion of predication gives rise to several questions and we will come\nback to it in the next section.</p>", "<p>\nIf states of affairs are ontologically dependent on particulars and\nproperties, we can satisfy the desiderata (i) to (iii):</p>", "<p id=\"desi\">\n(i) An object can ontologically depend on other objects without being\na complex that contains these objects as parts.

The assumption that the state of affairs \n<em><i>a</i>\u2019s being <i>F</i></em> ontologically depends on\n<i>a</i> and <i>F</i> can therefore solve the problems that arise for\nthe assumption that it contains <i>a</i> and <i>F</i>. Take for\nexample Frege\u2019s intuitive argument against the view that states\nof affairs contain physical objects like Vesuvius. The state of\naffairs <em>Vesuvius\u2019s being a volcano</em> ontologically\ndepends on Vesuvius, but it does not contain it as a part.

But\none way to develop it is to propose that the incomplete and connecting\nelements are functions. For example, the property <em>being</em>\n<i>F</i> is conceived of as a function that takes a particular\n<i>a</i> as argument and maps it to the state of affairs \n<em><i>a</i>\u2019s being</em> <i>F</i> (see Oliver 1992: 91). The\nproblems of the functional model of states of affairs are manifest in\nthe development of Frege\u2019s work. Frege 1879 held that sentences\nstand for what he called \u201cjudgeable contents\u201d, complexes\ncomposed of functions and objects. For Frege predication is the\napplication of a function to an object. Judgeable contents seem to be\nnothing other than states of affairs. However, the idea that states of\naffairs are complex does not sit happily with Frege\u2019s further\nidea that the judgeable content <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being</em>\n<i>F</i> is the value of the function <i>F</i> for <i>a</i> as\nargument.</p>", "<p>\nNow different functions have the same value for different arguments.\nFor example, 3 is the value of the function <em>Square root of\n<i>x</i></em> for 9 and the value of the function \\(x+1\\) for 2. Which\nof these arguments and functions is contained in the value 3? Since\nthere is no principle that singles out one argument and function as\nconstituting the value, we should abandon either the functional model\nof incompleteness or the idea that states of affairs have\nconstituents. Later Frege takes the second option:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe references of the parts of a sentence are not parts of the\nreference of the sentence. (Frege 1910\u201314: 87)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nSince different functions can have the same value for different\narguments, Frege arrived at the view that a sentence that is either\ntrue or false refers to its truth-value, the True or the False. Every\ntrue (false) sentence has the same referent: the True (the False).\nStates of affairs have no place in the Fregean theory of reference.\nThe \u201ccase study\u201d of Frege shows that the functional model\nof incompleteness undermines the very idea that states of affairs are\ncomplexes (for a reply to this argument see Gaskin 2008: 100).</p>", "<p>\nThe strategy to explain the unity of a state of affairs by using the\nnotion of incompleteness either only labels the problem or, if\nincomplete elements are taken to be functions, threatens the very idea\nof states of affairs. Can one dispense with the notion of\nincompleteness in an answer to the unity-question?</p>", "<p>\nThe unity-question arises on a conception that takes states of affairs\nto be ontologically dependent entities. Take the state of affairs\n<em>Aristotle\u2019s being wise</em>. It ontologically depends on\nAristotle and <em>being wise.</em> So do the ordered pair\n\\(\\langle\\)Aristotle, <em>being wise</em>\\(\\rangle\\) and the\nmereological sum of Aristotle and <em>being wise</em>. What\ndistinguishes them? If we follow Fine, the answer will invoke an\noperation that \u201cgenerates\u201d the entities in question.\nStates of affairs are generated by predication, ordered pairs by\nanother operation.</p>", "<p>\nNow saying that something is predicated of something else sounds as if\nthe existence of a state of affairs depends on performing an act. But\nthis is a misunderstanding. Johnston explains:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\n[P]redicability guarantees predication. Whenever <i>F</i>-ness is\npredicable of <i>a</i>, there will be something that is the\npredication of <i>F</i>-ness to <i>a</i>.

Wetzel (1998: 57) fills this\nsuggestion out in an informative way. An object may be in a range of\npossible states due to its capacities. Given that the computer I am\nwriting on belongs to a particular kind there is a range of\npossibilities for it to be: it might be broken, functioning well, be\nturned off etc. Its capacities and, broadly speaking, its nature is\nthe \u201contological ground of ranges of possible states of affairs\nin which [it is a constituent]\u201d (1998: 57). One should add that\nthe nature and capacities of an object also determine a range of\nimpossibilities such as the impossibility of my computer\u2019s\nbecoming a sentient being.</p>", "<p>\nHowever, consider my computer\u2019s being to the left of my lamp.\nThis is a possibility for my computer, but it is a brute possibility\nnot grounded in its causal powers.

What\ndistinguishes states of affairs from other entities which\nontologically depend on the same properties and particulars is that\nstates of affairs exist because the properties are predicable of the\nparticulars.</p>", "<p>\nThis account assumes that if <em>being <i>F</i></em> is predicable of\n<i>a</i>, there is a state of affairs <em><i>a</i>\u2019s being\n<i>F</i></em> that ontologically depends on them.

And let us\nintroduce \u2018proposition\u2019 as a term of art for whatever the\nvariables above, indicated in bold, range over. Propositions are\npotential premises/conclusions. They can be endorsed or rejected, and\nthey exhibit containment relations of some kind. So presumably,\npropositions are abstract things that can be evaluated for truth or\nfalsity. This leaves it open what propositions are: sentences,\nstatements, states of affairs, or whatever. But let's assume that\ndeclarative sentences can be used to express propositions. (For\ndiscussion, see Cartwright (1962) and the essay on\n <a href=\"../propositions-structured/\">structured propositions</a>.) </p>", "<p>A significant complication is that in ordinary conversation, the\ncontext matters with regard to which proposition is expressed with a\ngiven sentence. For example, \u2018Pat is asleep\u2019 can be used\nat one time to express a true premise, and at another time to express\na false premise. A given speaker might use \u2018I am tired\u2019 to\nexpress a false proposition, while another speaker uses the same\nsentence at the same time to express a true proposition. What counts\nas being tired can also vary across conversations. Context\nsensitivity, of various kinds, is ubiquitous in ordinary discourse.\nMoreover, even given a context, a sentence like \u2018He is\nbald\u2019 may not express a unique proposition. (There may be no\nreferent for the pronoun; and even if there is, the\n <a href=\"../vagueness/\">vagueness</a> of \u2018bald\u2019 may yield a\nrange of candidate propositions, with no fact of the matter as to\nwhich one is <em>the</em> proposition expressed.) Nonetheless, we can\noften use sentences like \u2018Every circle is an ellipse\u2019 and\n\u2018Thirteen is a prime number\u2019 to express premises of valid\narguments. To be sure, ordinary conversation differs from theoretical\ndiscourse in mathematics. But the distinction between impeccable and\nrisky inferences is not limited to special contexts in which we try to\nthink especially clearly about especially abstract matters. So when\nfocusing on the phenomenon of valid inference, we can try to simplify\nthe initial discussion by abstracting away from the context\nsensitivity of language use.\u00a0 </p>", "<p>\nAnother complication is that in speaking of an inference, one might be\ntalking about (i) a <em>process</em> in which a thinker draws a\nconclusion from some premises, or (ii) some <em>propositions</em>, one\nof which is designated as an alleged consequence of the others; see,\ne.g., Harman (1973). But we can describe a risky thought process as\none in which a thinker who accepts certain propositions\u2014perhaps\ntentatively or hypothetically\u2014comes to accept, on that basis, a\nproposition that does not follow from the initial premises. And it\nwill be simpler to focus on premises/conclusions, as opposed to\nepisodes of reasoning.</p>", "<p>\nWith regard to (1), the inference seems secure in part\n<em>because</em> its first premise has the form\n\u2018<strong>B</strong> if <strong>A</strong>\u2019. </p>", "<blockquote>\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr valign=\"top\">\n        <td align=\"left\">(1)</td>\n        <td align=\"left\">John danced if Mary sang, and Mary sang; so\nJohn\ndanced.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</blockquote>", "<p>If the first premise didn't have this form, the inference wouldn't\nbe an instance of \u2018<strong>B</strong> if <strong>A</strong>, and\n<strong>A</strong>; so <strong>B</strong>\u2019.

That is, even simple propositions have logical form. And as\nAristotle noted, pairs of such propositions can be related in\ninteresting ways. If every <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>, then some\n<em>S</em> is <em>P</em>. (For these purposes, assume there is at\nleast one <em>S</em>.) If no <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>, then some\n<em>S</em> is not <em>P</em>. It is certain that either every\n<em>S</em> is <em>P</em> or some <em>S</em> is not <em>P</em>; and\nwhichever of these propositions is true, the other is\nfalse. Similarly, the following propositions cannot both be true:\nevery <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>; and no <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>. But\nit isn't certain that either every <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>, or no\n<em>S</em> is <em>P</em>. Perhaps some <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>, and\nsome <em>S</em> is not <em>P</em>. This network of logical relations\nstrongly suggests that the propositions in question contain a\nquantificational element and two general elements\u2014and in some\ncases, an element of negation. This raises the question of whether\nother propositions have a similar structure.</p>", "<p>\nConsider the proposition that Vega is a star, which can figure in\ninferences like (8).</p>", "<blockquote>\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr valign=\"top\">\n        <td align=\"left\">(8)</td>\n        <td align=\"left\">Every star is purple, and Vega is a star; so\nVega is purple.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nAristotle's logic focused on quantificational propositions; and as we\nshall see, this was prescient. But on his view, propositions like the\nconclusion of (8) still exemplify a subject-predicate structure that\nis shared by at least many of the sentences we used to express\npropositions. And one can easily formulate the schema \u2018every\n<em>S</em> is <em>P</em>, and <em>n</em> is <em>S</em>; so <em>n</em>\nis <em>P</em>\u2019, where the new lower-case variable is intended to\nrange over proposition-parts of the sort indicated by names. (On some\nviews, discussed below, a name like \u2018Vega\u2019 is a complex\nquantificational expression; though unsurprisingly, such views are\ntendentious.)</p>", "<p> Typically, a declarative sentence can be divided into a subject\nand a predicate: \u2018Every star / is purple\u2019, \u2018Vega /\nis a star\u2019, \u2018Some politician / lied\u2019, \u2018The\nbrightest planet / is visible tonight\u2019, etc. Until quite\nrecently, it was widely held that this grammatical division reflects a\ncorresponding kind of logical structure: the subject of a proposition\n(i.e., what the proposition is about) is a target for predication. On\nthis view, both \u2018Every star\u2019 and \u2018Vega\u2019\nindicate subjects of propositions in (8), while \u2018is\u2019\nintroduces predicates. Aristotle would have said that in the premises\nof (8), being purple is predicated of every star, and being a star is\npredicated of Vega. Later theorists emphasized the contrast between\ngeneral terms like \u2018star\u2019 and singular terms like\n\u2018Vega\u2019, while also distinguishing terms from\nsyncategorematic expressions (e.g., \u2018every\u2019 and\n\u2018is\u2019) that can combine with terms to form complex subjects\nand predicates, including \u2018will lie\u2019, \u2018can\nlie\u2019, and \u2018may have lied\u2019. But despite the\ncomplications, it seemed clear that many propositions have the\nfollowing canonical form: Subject-copula-Predicate; where a copula\nlinks a subject, which may consist of a quantifier and a general term,\nto a general term. Sentences like \u2018Every star twinkles\u2019\ncan be paraphrased with sentences like \u2018Every star is a thing\nthat does some twinkling\u2019. This invites the suggestion that\n\u2018twinkles\u2019 is somehow an abbreviation for \u2018is a\nthing that does some twinkling\u2019, perhaps in the way that\n\u2018bachelor\u2019 is arguably short for \u2018unmarried\nmarriageable man\u2019.\u00a0</p>", "<p>The proposition that not only Vega twinkles, which seems to contain\nthe proposition that Vega twinkles, presumably includes elements that\nare indicated with \u2018only\u2019 and \u2018not\u2019. Such\nexamples invite the hypothesis that all propositions are composed of\nterms along with a relatively small number of syncategorematic\nelements, and that complex propositions can be reduced to canonical\npropositions that are governed by Aristotelian logic. This is not to\nsay that all propositions were, or could be, successfully analyzed in\nthis manner. But via this strategy, medieval logicians were able to\ndescribe many impeccable infererences as instances of valid forms. And\nthis informed their discussions of how logic is related to\ngrammar.</p>", "<p>Many viewed their project as an attempt to uncover principles of a\nmental language common to all thinkers. Aristotle had said, similarly,\nthat spoken sounds symbolize \u201caffections of the soul.\u201d\nFrom this perspective, one expects a few differences between\npropositions and overt sentences. If \u2018Every star twinkles\u2019\nexpresses a proposition that contains a copula, then spoken languages\nmask certain aspects of logical structure. Ockham also held that a\nmental language would have no need for Latin's declensions, and that\nlogicians could ignore such aspects of spoken language. The ancient\nGreeks were aware of sophisms like the following: that dog is a\nfather, and that dog is yours; so that dog is your father. This bad\ninference cannot share its form with the superficially parallel but\nimpeccable variant: that dog is a mutt, and that mutt is yours; so\nthat dog is your mutt. (See Plato, Euthydemus 298 d-e.) So the\nsuperficial features of sentences are not infallible guides to the\nlogical forms of propositions. Still, the divergence was held to be\nrelatively minor. Spoken sentences have structure; they are composed,\nin systematic ways, of words. And the assumption was that sentences\nreflect the major aspects of propositional form, including a\nsubject-predicate division. So while there is a distinction between\nthe study of valid inference and the study of sentences used in spoken\nlanguage, the connection between logic and grammar was thought to run\ndeep. This suggested that the logical form of a proposition just is\nthe grammatical form of some (perhaps mental) sentence.</p>", "<p>Towards the end of the eighteenth century, Kant could say (without\nmuch exaggeration) that logic had followed a single path since its\ninception, and that \u201csince Aristotle it has not had to retrace a\nsingle step.\u201d He also said that syllogistic logic was \u201cto\nall appearance complete and perfect.\u201d But this was exuberance.\nIndeed, some of the real successes highlighted known problems.</p>", "<p>Some valid schemata are reducible to others, in that any inference\nof the reducible form can be revealed as valid (with a little work)\ngiven other schemata. Consider (9).</p>", "<blockquote>\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr valign=\"top\">\n        <td align=\"left\">(9)</td>\n        <td align=\"left\">If Al ran then either Al did not run or Bob\ndid not\nswim, and Al ran; so Bob did not swim.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nAssume that \u2018Al did not run\u2019 negates \u2018Al ran\u2019,\nwhile \u2018Bob did not swim\u2019 negates \u2018Bob\nswam\u2019. Then (9) is an instance of the following valid form: if\n<strong>A</strong> then either not-<strong>A</strong> or\nnot-<strong>B</strong>, and <strong>A</strong>; so\nnot-<strong>B</strong>. But we can treat this as a derived form, by\nshowing that any instance of this form is valid given two (intuitively\nmore basic) Stoic inference forms: if <strong>the first </strong>then\n<strong>the second</strong>, and<strong> the first</strong>, so\n<strong>the second</strong>; either not<strong> the first </strong>or\nnot <strong>the second</strong>, and <strong>the first</strong>; so\nnot <strong>the second</strong>. For suppose we are given the\nfollowing premises: <strong>A</strong>; and if <strong>A</strong>,\nthen either not-<strong>A</strong> or not-<strong>B</strong>. We can\nsafely infer that either not-<strong>A</strong> or\nnot-<strong>B</strong>; and since we were given that\n<strong>A</strong>, we can safely infer that not-B. Similarly, the\nsyllogistic schema (10) can be treated as a derived form.</p>", "<blockquote>\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr valign=\"top\">\n        <td align=\"left\">(10)</td>\n        <td align=\"left\">Some <em>S</em> is not <em>P</em>, and every\n        <em>D</em> is <em>P</em>; so not every <em>S</em> is\n        <em>D</em>.</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nIf some <em>S</em> is not <em>P</em>, and every <em>D</em> is\n<em>P</em>, then it isn't true that every <em>S</em> is\n<em>D</em>. For if every <em>S</em> is <em>D</em>, and every\n<em>D</em> is <em>P</em>, then every<em> S</em> is <em>P</em>. But\n<em>if </em>some <em>S</em> is not <em>P</em>, then as we saw above,\nnot every <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>. So given the premises of (10),\nadding \u2018every<em> S</em> is <em>D</em>\u2019 would lead to\ncontradiction: every<em> S</em> is <em>P</em>, and not every<em>\nS</em> is <em>P</em>.  So the premises imply the <em>negation</em> of\n\u2018every<em> S</em> is <em>D</em>\u2019. This reasoning shows how\n(10) can be reduced to inferential patterns that seem more\nbasic\u2014raising the question of how much reduction is possible.\nEuclid's geometry had provided a model for how to present a body of\nknowledge as a network of propositions that follow from a few basic\naxioms. Aristotle himself indicated how to reduce all the valid\nsyllogistic schemata to four basic patterns, given a few principles\nthat govern how the basic patterns can be used to derive others; see\nParsons (2014) for discussion. And further reduction is possible given\ninsights from the medieval period.</p>", "<p>Consider the following pair of valid inferences: Fido is a brown\ndog, so Fido is a dog; Fido is not a dog, so Fido is not a brown dog.\nAs illustrated with the first example, replacing a predicate (or\ngeneral term) like \u2018brown dog\u2019 with a <em>less</em>\nrestrictive predicate like \u2018dog\u2019 is often valid. But\nsometimes\u2014paradigmatically, in cases involving\nnegation\u2014replacing a predicate like \u2018dog\u2019 with a\n<em>more</em> restrictive predicate like \u2018brown dog\u2019 is\nvalid. Plausibly, the first pattern reflects the default direction of\nvalid replacement: removing a restriction preserves truth, except in\nspecial cases like those involving negation. Suppose we take it as\ngiven that poodles are dogs of a particular sort, and hence that every\npoodle is a dog. Then replacing\u2018poodle\u2019 with \u2018dog'\nin \u2018Fido is <em>P</em>\u2019 is valid, regardless of what\n\u2018Fido\u2019 names. This can be viewed as a special case of\n\u2018<em>n</em> is <em>P</em>, and every <em>P</em> is <em>D</em>;\nso <em>n</em> is <em>D</em>\u2019. But the validity of this inference\nform can also be viewed as symptom of a basic principle that came be\ncalled <em>dictum de omni</em>: whatever is true of every <em>P</em>\nis true of any <em>P</em>. Or as Aristotle might have put it, if the\nproperty of being a dog belongs to every poodle, then it belongs to\nany poodle. In which case, Fido is a dog if Fido is a poodle. And\nsince the property of being a dog surely belongs to every brown dog,\nany brown dog is a dog. The flip side of this point is that negation\ninverts the default direction of inference. Anything that isn't a dog\nisn't a brown dog; and similarly, if Fido isn't a dog, Fido isn't a\npoodle. So in special cases, adding a restriction to a general term\nlike \u2018dog\u2019 can preserve truth.</p>", "<p>From this perspective, the Aristotelian quantifier\n\u2018Some\u2019 is a default-style quantifier that validates\n<em>removing</em> restrictions. If some brown dog is a clever mutt, it\nfollows that some dog is a clever mutt, and hence that some dog is a\nmutt. By contrast, \u2018No\u2019 is an inverted-style quantifier\nthat validates <em>adding </em>restrictions.  If no dog is a mutt, it\nfollows that no dog is a clever mutt, and hence that no brown dog is a\nclever mutt. The corresponding principle, <em>dictum de nullo</em>,\nencodes this pattern: whatever is true of no <em>P</em> is not true of\nany <em>P</em>; so if the property of being a mutt belongs to no dog,\nit belongs to no poodle. (And as Aristotle noted, instances of\n\u2018No <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>\u2019 can be analyzed as the\npropositional negations of corresponding instances of \u2018Some\n<em>S</em> isn't <em>P</em>\u2019.</p>", "<p>Interestingly, \u2018Every\u2019 is like \u2018No\u2019 in one\nrespect, and like \u2018Some\u2019 in another respect. If every dog\nis clever, it follows that every brown dog is clever; but if every dog\nis a clever mutt, it follows that every dog is a mutt. So when the\nuniversal quantifier combines with a general term <em>S</em> to form a\nsubject, <em>S</em> is governed by the <em>inverted</em> rule of\nreplacement.  But when a universally quantified subject combines with\na second general term to form a proposition, this second term is\ngoverned by the <em>default </em>rule of replacement. Given that\n\u2018Every\u2019 has this mixed logical character, the valid\nsyllogisms can be derived from two basic patterns (noted above), both\nof which reflect <em>dictum de omni</em>: whatever is true of every\n<em>P</em> is true of any <em>P</em>.\n</p>", "<blockquote><p>Every <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>, and every <em>P</em> is\n<em>D</em>; so every <em>S</em> is <em>D</em>.</p>\n\n<p>\nEvery <em>S</em> is <em>P</em>, and some <em>D</em> is <em>S</em>; so\nsome <em>D</em> is <em>P</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>The first principle reflects the sense in which universal\nquantification is transitive. The second principle captures the idea\nthat a universal premise can licence replacement of\n\u2018<em>S</em>\u2019 with \u2018<em>P</em>\u2019 in a premise\nabout a specific individual. In this sense, classical logic exhibits a\nstriking unity and simplicity, at least with regard to inferences\ninvolving the Aristotelian quantifiers and predication; see Sommers\n(1984) and Ludlow (2005), drawing on Sanchez (1991), for further\ndiscussion.</p>", "<p>Alas, matters become more complicated once we consider\nrelations.</p>", "<p>Sentences like \u2018Juliet kissed Romeo\u2019 do not seem to\nhave Subject-copula-Predicate form.

But \u2018kisser of\nRomeo\u2019 differs, in ways that matter to inference, from general\nterms like \u2018politician\u2019. If Juliet (or anyone) was a\nkisser of Romeo, it follows that someone was kissed; whereas if Juliet\nwas a politician, there is no corresponding logical consequence to the\neffect that someone was __-ed. Put another way, the proposition that\nJuliet kissed someone exhibits interesting logical structure, even if\nwe can express this proposition via the sentence \u2018Juliet was a\nkisser of someone\u2019.

But if impeccability is to be revealed as a matter of form,\nthen one way or another, quantifiers need to characterized in a way\nthat captures their general logical role\u2014and not just their role\nas potential subjects of Aristotelian propsitions. Quantifiers are not\nsimply devices for creating schemata like \u2018Every <em>S</em> is\n<em>P</em>\u2019, into which general terms like\n\u2018politician\u2019 and \u2018deceitful\u2019 can be\ninserted.

His system of logic, published in 1879 and still in\nuse (with notational modifications), was arguably the single greatest\ncontribution to the subject. So it is significant that on Frege's\nview, propositions do not have subject-predicate form. His account\nrequired a substantial distinction between logical form and\ngrammatical form as traditionally conceived. It is hard to\noveremphasize the impact of this point on subsequent discussions of\nthought and its relation to language. </p>", "<p>Frege's leading idea was that propositions have\n\u201cfunction-argument\u201d structure. Though for Frege, functions\nare not abstract objects. In particular, while a function maps each\nentity in some domain onto exactly one entity in some range, Frege\n(1891) does not identify functions with sets of ordered pairs. On the\ncontrary, he says that a function \u201cby itself must be called\nincomplete, in need of supplementation, or unsaturated. And in this\nrespect functions differ fundamentally from numbers (p. 133).\u201d\nFor example, we can represent the successor function as follows, with\nthe integers as the relevant domain for the variable \u2018x\u2019:\nS(x) = x + 1. This function maps zero onto one, one onto two, and so\non. We can specify a corresponding object\u2014e.g., the set\n{\u2329x, y\u232a: y = x + 1}\u2014as the \u201cvalue-range\u201d\nof the successor function. But according to Frege, any particular\nargument (e.g., the number one) \u201cgoes together with the function\nto make up a complete whole\u201d (e.g., the number two); and a\nnumber does not go together with a set in this fashion. Put another\nway, while each number is an object, a mapping from numbers to numbers\nis not an additional object in Frege\u2019s sense. As Frege noted,\nthe word \u2018function\u2019 is often used to talk about what he\nwould call the value-range of a function. But he maintained that the\nnotion of an unsaturated function, which may be applied to endlessly\nmany arguments, is \u201clogically prior\u201d to any notion of a\nset with endlessly many arguments that are specified functionally as\nin {\u2329x, y\u232a: y = x + 1}; see p.135, note E.</p>", "<p>\nFunctions need not be unary. For example, arithmetic division can be\nrepresented as a function from ordered pairs of numbers onto\nquotients: Q(x, y) = x/y. Mappings can also be conditional. Consider\nthe function that maps every even integer onto itself, and every odd\ninteger onto its successor: C(x) = x if x is even, and x + 1\notherwise; C(1) = 2, C(2) = 2, C(3) = 4, etc. Frege held that\npropositions have parts that indicate functions, and in particular,\nconditional functions that map arguments onto special values that\nreflect the truth or falsity of propositions/sentences. (As discussed\nbelow, Frege [1892] also distinguished these \u201ctruth\nvalues\u201d from what he called Thoughts [Gedanken] or the\n\u201csenses\u201d [Sinnen] of propositions; where each of these\nsentential senses \u201cpresents\u201d a truth value in certain\nway\u2014i.e., as the value of a certain indicated function given a\ncertain indicated argument.).</p>", "<p> Variable letters, such as \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 in\n\u2018Q(x, y) = x/y\u2019, are typographically convenient for\nrepresenting functions that take more than one argument. But we could\nalso index argument places, as shown below.</p>", "<blockquote>Q[(\u00a0 )<sub><i>i</i></sub> , (\u00a0\n)<sub><i>j</i></sub>] = (\u00a0 )<sub><i>i</i></sub> / (\u00a0\n)<sub><i>j</i></sub></blockquote>", "<p>Or we could replace the subscripts above with lines that connect\neach pair of round brackets on the left of \u2018=\u2019 to a\ncorresponding pair of brackets on the right. But the idea, however we\nencode it, is that a proposition has at least one constituent that is\nsaturated by the requisite number of arguments. (If it helps, think of\nan unsaturated proposition-part as the result of abstracting away from\none or more arguments in a complete proposition.) Frege was here\ninfluenced by Kant's discussion of judgment, and the ancient\nobservation that merely combining two things does not make the\ncombination truth-evaluable. So in saying that propositions have\n\u201cfunction-argument\u201d structure, Frege was not only\nrejecting the traditional idea that logical from reflects the\n\u201csubject-predicate\u201d structure of ordinary sentences, he\nwas suggesting that propositions exhibit a special kind of unity:\nunlike a mere concatenation of objects, a potential premise/conclusion\nis formed by saturating an unsaturated mapping with a suitable\nargument.</p>", "<p>\n\nOn Frege's view, the <em>proposition</em> that Mary sang has a\nfunctional component indicated by \u2018sang\u2019 and an argument\nindicated by \u2018Mary\u2019, even if the English <em>sentence</em>\n\u2018Mary sang\u2019 has \u2018Mary\u2019 as its subject and\n\u2018sang\u2019 as its predicate. The proposition can be\nrepresented as follows: Sang(Mary). Frege thought of the relevant\nfunction as a conditional mapping from individuals to truth values:\nSang(x) = <strong>T</strong> if x sang, and <strong>F</strong>\notherwise; where \u2018<strong>T</strong>\u2019 and\n\u2018<strong>F</strong>\u2019 stand for special entities such that\nfor each individual x, Sang(x) = <strong>T</strong> if and only if x\nsang, and Sang(x) = <strong>F</strong> if and only if x did not\nsing. According to Frege, the proposition that John admires Mary\ncombines an ordered pair of arguments with a functional component\nindicated by the transitive verb: Admires(John, Mary); where for any\nindividual x, and any individual y, Admires(x, y) = <strong>T</strong>\nif x admires y, and <strong>F</strong> otherwise.  From this\nperspective, the structure and constituents are the same in the\nproposition that Mary is admired by John, even though\n\u2018Mary\u2019 is the grammatical subject of the passive\nsentence. Likewise, Frege did not distinguish the proposition that\nthree precedes four from the proposition that four is preceded by\nthree. More importantly, Frege's treatment of quantified propositions\ndeparts radically from the traditional idea that the grammatical\nstructure of sentence reflects the logical structure of the indicated\nproposition.\n</p>", "<p>If S is the function indicated by \u2018sang\u2019, then Mary\nsang iff\u2014i.e., if and only if\u2014S(Mary) =\n<strong>T</strong>.  Likewise, someone sang iff: S maps some\nindividual onto <strong>T</strong>; that is, for some individual x,\nS(x) = <strong>T</strong>. Or using a modern variant of Frege's\noriginal notation, someone sang iff \u2203x[S(x)]. The quantifier\n\u2018\u2203x\u2019 is said to bind the variable \u2018x\u2019,\nwhich ranges over individual things in a domain of discourse. (For\nnow, assume that the domain contains only people.) If every individual\nin the domain sang, then S maps every individual onto the truth value\n<strong>T</strong>; or using formal notation, \u2200x[S(x)]. A\nquantifier binds each occurrence of its variable, as in\n\u2018\u2203x[P(x) &amp; D(x)]\u2019, which reflects the logical\nform of \u2018Someone is both a politician and deceitful\u2019. In\nthis last example, the quantifier combines with a complex predicate\nthat formed by conjoining two simpler predicates.</p>", "<p> With regard to the proposition that some politician is deceitful,\ntraditional grammar suggests the division \u2018Some politician / is\ndeceitful\u2019, with the noun \u2018politician\u2019 forming a\nconstituent with the quantificational word. But on a Fregean view,\ngrammar masks the logical division between the existential quantifier\nand the rest: \u2203x[P(x) &amp; D(x)]. With regard to the\nproposition that every politician is deceitful, Frege also stresses\nthe logical division between the quantifier and its scope:\n\u2200x[P(x) \u2192 D(x)]; every individual is deceitful if a\npolitician. Here too, the quantifier combines with a complex\npredicate, albeit a conditional rather than conjunctive\npredicate. (The formal sentence \u2018\u2200x[P(x) &amp;\nD(x)]\u2019 implies, unconditionally, that every individual is a\npolitician.) As Frege (1879) defined his analogs of the relevant\nmodern symbols used here, \u2018P(x) \u2192 D(x)\u2019 is equivalent\nto \u2018\u00acP(x) \u2228 D(x)\u2019, and \u2018\u2200x\u2019 is\nequivalent to \u2018\u00ac\u2203x\u00ac\u2019. So\n\u2018\u2200x[P(x) \u2192 D(x)]\u2019 is equivalent to\n\u2018\u00ac\u2203x\u00ac[\u00acP(x) \u2228 D(x)]\u2019; and given de\nMorgan's Laws (concerning the relations between negation, disjunction,\nand conjunction), \u00ac\u2203x\u00ac[\u00acP(x) \u2228 D(x)] iff\n\u00ac\u2203x[P(x) &amp; \u00acD(x)]. Hence, \u2200x[P(x) \u2192\nD(x)] iff \u00ac\u2203x[P(x) &amp; \u00acD(x)]. This captures the idea\nthat every politician is deceitful iff no individual is both a\npolitician and not deceitful.</p>", "<p>If this conception of logical form is correct, then grammar is\nmisleading in several respects.  First, grammar leads us to think that\n\u2018some politician\u2019 indicates a constituent of the\nproposition that some politician is deceitful. Second, grammar masks a\ndifference between existential and universally quantified\npropositions; predicates are related conjunctively in the former, and\nconditionally in the latter. (Though as discussed\nin <a href=\"#not\">section seven</a>, one can\u2014and Frege [1884]\ndid\u2014adopt a different view that allows for relational/restricted\nquantifiers as in \u2018\u2200x:P(x)[D(x)]\u2019.)</p>", "<p>More importantly, Frege's account was designed to\napply equally well to propositions involving relations and multiple\nquantifiers. And with regard to these propositions, there seems to be\na big difference between logical structure and grammatical\nstructure.</p>", "<p>On Frege's view, a single quantifier can bind an unsaturated\nposition that is associated with a function that takes a single\nargument. But it is equally true that two quantifiers can bind two\nunsaturated positions associated with a function that takes a pair of\narguments. For example, the proposition that everyone likes everyone\ncan be represented with the formal sentence\n\u2018\u2200x\u2200y[L(x, y)]\u2019. Assuming that\n\u2018Romeo\u2019 and \u2018Juliet\u2019 indicate arguments, it\nfollows that Romeo likes everyone, and that everyone likes\nJuliet\u2014\u2200y[L(r, y)] and \u2200x[L(x, j)]. And it follows\nfrom all three propositions that Romeo likes Juliet: L(r, j). The\nrules of inference for Frege's logic capture this general feature of\nthe universal quantifier. A variable bound by a universal quantifier\ncan be replaced with a name for some individual in the\ndomain. Correlatively, a name can be replaced with a variable bound by\nan existential quantifier.  Given that Romeo likes Juliet, it follows\nthat someone likes Juliet, and Romeo likes someone. Frege's formalism\ncan capture this as well: L(r, j); so \u2203x[L(x, j)] &amp;\n\u2203x[L(r, x)]. And given either conjunct in the conclusion, it\nfollows that someone likes someone: \u2203x\u2203y[L(x, y)]. A\nsingle quantifier can also bind multiple argument positions, as in\n\u2018\u2203x[L(x, x)]\u2019, which is true iff someone likes\nherself. Putting these points schematically:\n\u2200x(\u2026x\u2026), so \u2026n\u2026; and\n\u2026n\u2026, so \u2203x(\u2026x\u2026).</p>", "<p>Mixed quantification introduces an interesting wrinkle. The\npropositions expressed with \u2018\u2203x\u2200y[L(x,y)]\u2019\nand \u2018\u2200y\u2203x[L(x,y)]\u2019 differ. We can paraphrase\nthe first as \u2018there is someone who likes everyone\u2019 and the\nsecond as \u2018everyone is liked by someone or other\u2019. The\nsecond follows from the first, but not vice versa. This suggests that\n\u2018someone likes everyone\u2019 is ambiguous, in that this string\nof English words can be used to express two different\npropositions. This in turn raises difficult questions about what\nnatural language expressions are, and how they can be used to express\npropositions; see <a href=\"#tran\">section eight</a>. But for Frege,\nthe important point concerned the distinction between the propositions\n(Gedanken). Similar remarks apply to \u2018\u2200x\u2203y[L(x,\ny)]\u2019 and \u2018\u2203y\u2200x[L(x, y)]\u2019.</p>", "<p>A related phenomenon is exhibited by \u2018John danced if Mary\nsang and Chris slept\u2019. Is the intended proposition of the form\n\u2018(<strong>A</strong> if <strong>B</strong>) and\n<strong>C</strong>\u2019 or \u2018<strong>A</strong> if\n(<strong>B</strong> and <strong>C</strong>)\u2019?  Indeed, it seems\nthat the relation between word-strings and propositions expressed is\noften one-to-many. Is someone who says \u2018The artist drew a\nclub\u2019 talking about a sketch or a card game? One can use\n\u2018is\u2019 to express identity, as in \u2018Hesperus is the\nplanet Venus\u2019; but in \u2018Hesperus is bright\u2019,\n\u2018is\u2019 indicates predication. In \u2018Hesperus is a\nplanet\u2019, \u2018a\u2019 seems to be logically inert; yet in\n\u2018John saw a planet\u2019, \u2018a\u2019 seems to indicate\nexistential quantification: \u2203x[P(x) &amp; S(j,x)]. (One can\nrender \u2018Hesperus is a planet\u2019 as \u2018\u2203x[P(x)\n&amp; h = x]\u2019. But this treats \u2018is a planet\u2019 as\nimportantly different than \u2018is bright\u2019; and this leads to\nother difficulties.) According to Frege, such ambiguities provide\nfurther evidence that natural language is not suited to the task of\nrepresenting propositions and inferential relations perspicuously. And\nhe wanted a language that was suited for this task. (Leibniz and\nothers had envisioned a \u201cCharacteristica Universalis\u201d, but\nwithout detailed proposals for how to proceed beyond syllogistic logic\nin creating one.) This is not to deny that natural language is well\nsuited for other purposes, perhaps including efficient human\ncommunication.  And Frege held that we often do use natural language\nto express propositions. But he suggested that natural language is\nlike the eye, whereas a good formal language is like a microscope that\nreveals structure not otherwise observable. On this view, the logical\nform of a proposition is made manifest by the structure of a sentence\nin an ideal formal language\u2014what Frege called a Begriffsschrift\n(concept-script); where the sentences of such a language exhibit\nfunction-argument structures that differ in kind from the grammatical\nstructures exhibited by the sentences we use in ordinary\ncommunication.</p>", "<p>The real power of Frege's strategy for representing propositional\nstructure is most evident in his discussions of proofs by induction,\nthe Dedekind-Peano axioms for arithemetic, and how the proposition\nthat every number has a successor is logically related to more basic\ntruths of arithmetic; see the entry on\n <a href=\"../frege-theorem/\">Frege's theorem and foundations for arithmetic</a>.\n But without getting into these details, one can get a\nsense of Frege's improvement on previous logic by considering\n(15\u201316) and Fregean analyses of the corresponding\npropositions.</p>", "<blockquote>\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr>\n        <td>(15)</td>\n        <td>Every patient respects some doctor</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td> <br>\n        </td>\n        <td>\u2200x{P(x) \u2192\n\u2203y[D(y) &amp; R(x,y)]}</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td>(16)</td>\n        <td>Every old patient respects some doctor</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr>\n        <td> <br>\n        </td>\n        <td>\u2200x{[O(x) &amp; P(x)] \u2192\n\u2203y[D(y) &amp; R(x,y)]}</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nSuppose that every individual has the following conditional property:\nif he<sub><i>x</i></sub> is a patient, then some individual is such\nthat she<sub><i>y</i></sub> is both a doctor and respected by\nhim<sub><i>x</i></sub>.

This explains why\nthe direction of valid inference is from the more restrictive\n\u2018young doctor\u2019 in (13) to the less restrictive\n\u2018patient\u2019 in (14), despite the fact that in simpler cases,\nreplacing \u2018every doctor\u2019 with \u2018every young\ndoctor\u2019 is valid. More generally, Frege's logic handles a wide\nrange of inferences that had puzzled medieval logicians. But the\nFregean logical forms seem to differ dramatically from the grammatical\nforms of sentences like (13\u201316). Frege concluded that we need a\nBegriffsschrift, distinct from the languages we naturally speak, in\norder to depict (and help us discern) the structures of the\npropositions we express by using natural languages.</p>", "<p>\nFrege also made a different kind of contribution, which would prove\nimportant, to the study of propositions. In early work, he spoke as\nthough propositional constituents were the relevant functions and\n(ordered n-tuples of) entities that such functions map to\ntruth-values.  But he later refined this view in light of his\ndistinction between Sinn and Bedeutung (see the entry on\n <a href=\"../frege/\">Gottlob Frege</a>).  The Sinn of an expression was\nsaid to be a \u201cway of presenting\u201d the corresponding\nBedeutung, which might be an entity, a truth-value, or a function from\n(ordered n-tuples of) entities to truth-values. The basic idea is that\ntwo names, like \u2018Hesperus\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus\u2019,\ncan present the same Bedeutung in different ways; in which case, the\nSinn of the first name differs from the Sinn of the second. Given this\ndistinction, we can think of \u2018Hesperus\u2019 as an expression\nthat presents the evening star (a.k.a. Venus) as such, while\n\u2018Phosphorus\u2019 presents the morning star (also a.k.a. Venus)\nin a different way. Likewise, we can think of \u2018is bright\u2019\nas an expression that presents a certain function in a certain way,\nand \u2018Hesperus is bright\u2019 as a sentence that presents its\ntruth-value in a certain way\u2014i.e., as the value of the function\nin question given the argument in question. From this perspective,\npropositions are sentential ways of presenting truth-values, and\nproposition-parts are subsentential ways of presenting functions and\narguments. Frege could thus distinguish the proposition that Hesperus\nis bright from the proposition that Phosphorus is bright, even though\nthe two propositions are alike with regard to the relevant function\nand argument. Likewise, he could distinguish the trivial proposition\nHesperus is Hesperus from the (apparently nontrivial) proposition\nHesperus is Phosphorus. This is an attractive view. For intuitively,\nancient astronomers were correct not to regard the inference Hesperus\nis Hesperus, so Hesperus is Phosphorus as an instance of the following\nvalid schema: <strong>A</strong>, so <strong>A</strong>. But this\nraised questions about what the Sinn of an expression really is, what\n\u201cpresentation\u201d could amount to, and what to say about a\nname with no Bedeutung.</p>", "<p>Frege did not distinguish (or at least did not emphasize any\ndistinction between) names like \u2018John\u2019 and descriptions\nlike \u2018the boy\u2019 or \u2018the tall boy from Canada\u2019.\nInitially, both kinds of expression seem to indicate arguments, as\nopposed to functions. So one might think that the logical form of\n\u2018The boy sang\u2019 is simply \u2018S(b)\u2019, where\n\u2018b\u2019 is an unstructured symbol that stands for the boy in\nquestion (and presents him in a certain way). But this makes the\nelements of a description logically irrelevant. And this seems\nwrong. If the tall boy from Canada sang, then some boy from Canada\nsang. Moreover, \u2018the\u2019 implies <em>uniqueness</em> in a way\nthat \u2018some\u2019 does not. Of course, one can say \u2018The\nboy sang\u2019 without denying that universe contains more than one\nboy. But likewise, in ordinary conversation, one can say\n\u2018Everything is in the trunk\u2019 without denying that the\nuniverse contains some things not in the trunk. And intuitively, a\nspeaker who uses \u2018the\u2019 does imply that the adjacent\npredicate is satisfied by exactly one contextually relevant thing.</p>", "<p>\n<a href=\"../russell/\">Bertrand Russell</a> held that these\nimplications reflect the logical form of a proposition expressed (in a\ngiven context) with a definite description.  On his view, \u2018The\nboy sang\u2019 has the following logical form: \u2203x{Boy(x) &amp;\n\u2200y[Boy(y) \u2192 y = x] &amp; S(x)}; some\nindividual<sub><i>x</i></sub> is such that he<sub><i>x</i></sub> is a\nboy, and every (relevant) individual<sub><i>y</i></sub> is such that\nif he<sub><i>y</i></sub> is a boy, then he<sub><i>y</i></sub> is\nidentical with him<sub><i>x</i></sub>, and he<sub><i>x</i></sub>\nsang. The awkward middle conjunct was Russell's way of expressing\nuniqueness with Fregean tools; cf.\n <a href=\"#not\">section seven</a>. But rewriting the middle conjunct would not affect\nRussell's technical point, which is that \u2018the boy\u2019 does\nnot correspond to any constituent of the formalism.  This in turn\nreflects Russell's central claim\u2014viz., that while a speaker may\nrefer to a certain boy in saying \u2018The boy sang\u2019, the boy\nin question is not a constituent of the proposition\nindicated. According to Russell, the proposition has the form of an\nexistential quantification with a bound variable. It does <em>not</em>\nhave the form of a function saturated by (an argument that is) the boy\nreferred to. The proposition is general rather than singular. In this\nrespect, \u2018the boy\u2019 is like \u2018some boy\u2019 and\n\u2018every boy\u2019; though on Russell's view, not even\n\u2018the\u2019 indicates a constituent of the proposition\nexpressed.</p>", "<p>\nThis extended Frege's idea that natural language misleads us about the\nstructure of the propositions we assert. Russell went on to apply this\nhypothesis to what became a famous puzzle. Even though France is\ncurrently kingless, \u2018The present king of France is bald\u2019\ncan be used to express a proposition. The sentence is not meaningless;\nit has implications. So if the proposition consists of the function\nindicated with \u2018Bald(\u00a0)\u2019 and an argument indicated\nwith \u2018The present king of France\u2019, there must be an\nargument so indicated. But appeal to nonexistent kings is, to say the\nleast, dubious. Russell concluded that \u2018The present king of\nFrance is bald\u2019 expresses a quantificational proposition:\n\u2203x{K(x) &amp; \u2200y[K(y) \u2192 y = x] &amp; B(x)}; where\nK(x) = <strong>T</strong> iff x is a present king of France, and B(x)\n= <strong>T</strong> iff x is bald. (For present purposes, set aside\nworries about the vagueness of \u2018bald\u2019.)  And as Russell\nnoted, the following contrary reasoning is spurious: every proposition\nis true or false; so the present king of France is bald or not; so\nthere is a king of France, and he is either bald or not. For let\n<strong>P</strong> be the proposition that the king of France is\nbald. Russell held that <strong>P </strong>is indeed true or false. On\nhis view, it is false. Given that \u00ac\u2203x[K(x)], it follows that\n\u00ac\u2203x{K(x) &amp; \u2200y[K(y) \u2192 y = x] &amp; B(x)}. But\nit does not follow that there is a present king of France who is\neither bald or not. Given that \u00ac\u2203x[K(x)], it hardly follows\nthat \u2203x{K(x) &amp; [B(x) v \u00acB(x)]}. So we must not confuse\nthe negation of <strong>P</strong> with the following false\nproposition: \u2203x{K(x) &amp; \u2200y[K(y) \u2192 y = x] &amp;\n\u00acB(x)}. The ambiguity of natural language may foster such\nconfusion, given examples like \u2018The present king of France is\nbald or not\u2019. But according to Russell, puzzles about\n\u201cnonexistence\u201d can be resolved without special\nmetaphysical theses, given the right views about logical form and\nnatural language.</p>", "<p>\nThis invited the thought that other philosophical puzzles might\n<em>dissolve</em> if we properly understood the logical forms of our\nclaims. Wittgenstein argued, in his influential <em>Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus</em>, that: (i) the very possibility of\nmeaningful sentences, which can be true or false depending on how the\nworld is, requires propositions with structures of the sort Frege and\nRussell were getting at; (ii) all propositions are logical compounds\nof\u2014and thus analyzable into\u2014atomic propositions that are\ninferentially independent of one another; though (iii) even simple\nnatural language sentences may indicate very complex propositions; and\n(iv) the right analyses would, given a little reflection, reveal all\nphilosophical puzzles as confusions about how language is related to\nthe world. Russell never endorsed (iv). And Wittgenstein later noted\nthat claims like \u2018This is red\u2019 and \u2018This is\nyellow\u2019 presented difficulties for his earlier view. If the\nexpressed propositions are unanalyzable, and thus logically\nindependent, each should be compatible with the other. But at least so\nfar, no one has provided a plausible analysis that accounts for the\napparent impeccabilty of \u2018This is red, so this is not\nyellow\u2019. (This raises questions about whether <em>all</em>\ninferential security is due to logical form.) Though for reasons\nrelated to epistemological puzzles, Russell did say that (a) we are\n<em>directly acquainted</em> with the constituents of those\npropositions into which every proposition (that we can grasp) can be\nanalyzed; (b) at least typically, we are not directly acquainted with\nthe mind-independent bearers of proper names; and so (c) the things we\ntypically refer to with names are not constituents of basic\npropositions.</p>", "<p>\nThis led Russell to say that natural language names are disguised\ndescriptions. On this view, \u2018Hesperus\u2019 is semantically\nassociated with a complex predicate\u2014say, for illustration, a\npredicate of the form \u2018E(x) &amp; S(x)\u2019, suggesting\n\u2018evening star\u2019. In which case, \u2018Hesperus is\nbright\u2019 expresses a proposition of the form\n\u2018\u2203x{[E(x) &amp; S(x)] &amp; \u2200y{[E(y) &amp; S(y)]\n\u2192 y = x]} &amp; B(x)}\u2019. It also follows that Hesperus\nexists iff \u2203x[E(x) &amp; S(x)]; and this would be challenged by\nKripke (1980); see the entries on\n <a href=\"../rigid-designators/\">rigid-designators</a> and\n <a href=\"../names/\">names</a>. But by analyzing names as\ndescriptions\u2014quantificational expressions, as opposed to logical\nconstants (like \u2018b\u2019) that indicate\nindividuals\u2014Russell offered an attractive account of why the\nproposition that Hesperus is bright differs from the proposition that\nPhosphorus is bright. Instead of saying that propositional\nconstituents are Fregean senses, Russell could say that\n\u2018Phosphorus is bright\u2019 expresses a proposition of the form\n\u2018\u2203x{[M(x) &amp; S(x)] &amp; \u2200y{[M(y) &amp; S(y)]\n\u2192 y = x]} &amp; B(x)\u2019; where \u2018E(x)\u2019 and\n\u2018M(x)\u2019 indicate different functions, specified\n(respectively) in terms of evenings and mornings. This leaves room for\nthe discovery that the complex predicates \u2018E(x) &amp;\nS(x)\u2019 and \u2018M(x) &amp; S(x)\u2019 both indicate functions\nthat map Venus and nothing else to the truth-value\n<strong>T</strong>. The hypothesis was that the propositions expressed\nwith \u2018Hesperus is bright\u2019 and \u2018Phosphorus is\nbright\u2019 have different (fundamental) constituents, even though\nHesperus is Phosphorus, but not because propositional constituents are\n\u201cways of presenting\u201d Bedeutungen. Similarly, the idea was\nthat the propositions expressed with \u2018Hesperus is\nHesperus\u2019 and \u2018Hesperus is Phosphorus\u2019 differ,\nbecause only the latter has predicational/unsaturated constituents\ncorresponding to \u2018Phosphorus\u2019. Positing unexpected logical\nforms seemed to have explanatory payoffs.</p>", "<p>\nQuestions about names and descriptions are also related to\npsychological reports, like \u2018Mary thinks Venus is bright\u2019,\nwhich present puzzles of their own; see the entry on\n <a href=\"../prop-attitude-reports/\">propositional attitude reports</a>.\n Such reports seem to indicate propositions that are\nneither atomic nor logical compounds of simpler propositions. For as\nFrege noted, replacing one name with another name for the same object\ncan apprarently affect the truth of a psychological report. If Mary\nfails to know that Hesperus is Venus, she might think Venus is a\nplanet without thinking Hesperus is a planet; though cp. Soames (1987,\n1995, 2002) and see the entry on\n <a href=\"../propositions-singular/\">singular propositions</a>. Any\nfunction that has the value <strong>T</strong> given Venus as argument\nhas the value <strong>T</strong> given Hesperus as argument. So Frege,\nRussell, and Wittgenstein all held\u2014in varying ways\u2014that\npsychological reports are also misleading with respect to the logical\nforms of the indicated propositions.</p>", "<p>\nWithin the analytic tradition inspired by these philosophers, it\nbecame a commonplace that logical form and grammatical form typically\ndiverge, often in dramatic ways. This invited attempts to provide\nanalyses of propositions, and accounts of natural language, with the\naim of saying how relatively simple sentences (with subject-predicate\nstructures) could be used to express propositions (with\nfunction-argument structures).</p>", "<p>\nThe logical positivists explored the idea that the meaning of a\nsentence is a procedure for determining the truth or falsity of that\nsentence. From this perspective, studies of linguistic meaning and\npropositional structure still dovetail, even if natural language\nemploys \u201cconventions\u201d that make it possible to indicate\ncomplex propositions with grammatically simple sentences; see the\nentry on <a href=\"../analysis/\">analysis</a>. But to cut short a long\nand interesting story, there was little success in formulating\n\u201csemantic rules\u201d that were plausible both as (i)\ndescriptions of how ordinary speakers understand sentences of natural\nlanguage, and (ii) analyses that revealed logical structure of the\nsort envisioned. (And until Montague [1970], discussed briefly in the\nnext section, there was no real progress in showing how to\nsystematically associate quantificational constructions of natural\nlanguage with Fregean logical forms.)</p>", "<p>\n<!--<a href=\"../carnap/\">--> Rudolf Carnap<!--</a>-->, one of the\nleading positivists, responded to difficulties facing his earlier\nviews by developing a sophisticated position according to which\nphilosophers could (and should) articulate alternative sets of\nconventions for associating sentences of a language with\npropositions. Within each such language, the conventions would\ndetermine what follows from what. But one would have to decide, on\nbroadly pragmatic grounds, which interpreted language was best for\ncertain purposes (like conducting scientific inquiry). On this view,\nquestions about \u201cthe\u201d logical form of an ordinary sentence\nare in part questions about which conventions one should adopt. The\nidea was that \u201cinternal\u201d to any logically perspicuous\nlinguistic scheme, there would be an answer to the question of how two\nsentences are inferentially related. But \u201cexternal\u201d\nquestions, about which conventions we should adopt, would not be\nsettled by descriptive facts about how we understand languages that we\nalready use.</p>", "<p>\nThis was, in many ways, an attractive development of Frege's vision.\nBut it also raised a skeptical worry. Perhaps the structural\nmismatches between sentences of a natural language and sentences of a\nFregean Begriffsschrift are so severe that one cannot formulate\ngeneral rules for associating the sentences we ordinarily use with\npropositions. Later theorists would combine this view with the idea\nthat propositions are sentences of a mental language that is\nrelevantly like Frege's invented language and relevantly unlike the\nspoken languages humans use to communicate; see Fodor (1975,\n1978). But given the rise of\n <a href=\"../behaviorism/\">behaviorism</a>, both in philosophy and\npsychology, this variant on a medieval idea was initially ignored or\nridiculed.

On this view, claims\nabout logical form are evaluative, and such claims are underdetermined\nby the totality of facts concerning speakers' dispositions to use\nlanguage. From this perspective, mismatches between logical and\ngrammatical form are to be expected, and we should not conclude that\nordinary speakers have mental representations that are isomorphic with\nsentences of a Fregean Begriffsschrift.</p>", "<p>\nAccording to Quine, speakers' behavioral dispositions constrain what\ncan be plausibly said about how to best regiment their language.

But unsurprisingly, this left ample room\nfor \u201cslack\u201d with respect to which logical forms should be\nassociated with a given sentential utterance.</p>", "<p>\nQuine also held that decisions about how to make such associations\nshould be made <em>holistically</em>. As he sometimes put it, the\n\u201cunit of translation\u201d is an entire language, not a\nparticular sentence. On this view, one can translate a sentence\n<em>S</em> of a natural language NL with a structurally mismatching\nsentence\n\u00b5\nof a formal language FL, even if it seems (locally) implausible\nthat <em>S</em> is used to express the proposition associated with\n\u00b5, so long as the following condition is met: the association\nbetween <em>S</em> and \u00b5 is part of a general account of NL and\nFL that figures in an overall theory\u2014which includes an account\nof language, logic, and the language-independent world\u2014that is\namong the best overall theories available. This holistic conception of\nhow to evaluate proposed regimentations of natural language was part\nand parcel of Quine's criticism of the early positivists' \n<a href=\"../analytic-synthetic/\">analytic-synthetic distinction</a>, and\nhis more radical suggestion that there is no\nsuch distinction.</p>", "<p>\nThe suggestion was that even apparently tautologous sentences, like\n\u2018Bachelors are unmarried\u2019 and \u2018Caesar died if Brutus\nkilled him\u2019, have empirical content. These may be among the last\nsentences we would dissent from, faced with recalcitrant experience;\nwe may prefer to say that Caesar didn't really die, or that Brutus\ndidn't really kill him, if the next best alternative is to deny the\nconditional claim. But for Quine, every meaningful claim is a claim\nthat could turn out to be false\u2014and so a claim we must be\nprepared, at least in principle, to reject. Correlatively, no\nsentences are known to be true simply by knowing what they mean (and\nknowing <em>a priori</em> that sentences with such meanings must be\ntrue).</p>", "<p>\nFor present purposes, we can abstract away from the details of debates\nabout whether Quine's overall view was plausible. Here, the important\npoint is that claims about logical form were said to be (at least\npartly) claims about the kind of regimented language we\n<em>should</em> use, not claims about the propositions actually\nexpressed with sentences of natural language. And one aspect of\nQuine's view, about the kind of regimented language we <em>should</em>\nuse, turned out to be especially important for subsequent discussions\nof logical form.  For even among those who rejected the behavioristic\nassumptions that animated Quine's conception of language, it was often\nheld that logical forms are expressions of a first-order predicate\ncalculus.</p>", "<p>\nFrege's Begriffsschrift, recall, was designed to capture the\nDedekind-Peano axioms for arithmetic, including the axiom of\ninduction; see the entry on\n <a href=\"../frege-theorem/\">Frege's theorem and foundations for arithmetic</a>.\n This required\nquantification into positions occupiable by predicates, as well as\npositions occupiable by names. Using modern notation, Frege allowed\nfor formulae like \u2018(Fa &amp; Fb) \u2192 \u2203X(Xa &amp;\nXb)\u2019 and \u2018\u2200x\u2200y[x = y \u2194 \u2200X(Xx\n\u2194 Xy)]\u2019. And he took second-order quantification to be\nquantification over functions. This is to say, for example, that\n\u2018\u2203X(Xa &amp; Xb)\u2019 is true iff: there is a function,\nX, that maps both the individual called \u2018a\u2019 and the\nindividual called \u2018b\u2019 onto the truth-value\n<strong>T</strong>. Frege also took it to be a truth of logic that for\nany predicate <em>P</em>, there is a function such that for each\nindividual x, that function maps x to <strong>T</strong> iff x\nsatisfies (or \u201cfalls under\u201d) <em>P</em>.  In which case,\nfor each predicate, there is the set of all and only the things that\nsatisfy the predicate. The axioms for Frege's logic thus generated\n <a href=\"../russell-paradox/\">Russell's paradox</a>, given predicates\nlike \u2018is not a member of itself\u2019. This invited attempts to\n<em>weaken</em> the axioms, while preserving second-order\nquantification. But for various reasons, Quine and others advocated a\nrestriction to a first-order fragment of Frege's logic, disallowing\nquantification into positions occupied by predicates. (Godel had\nproved the completeness of first-order predicate calculus, thus\nproviding a purely formal criterion for what followed from what in\nthat language. Quine also held that second-order quantification\nillicitly treated predicates as names for sets, thereby spoiling\nFrege's conception of propositions as unified by virtue of having\nunsaturated predicational constituents that are satisfied by things\ndenoted by names.) On Quine's view, we should replace \u2018(Fa &amp;\nFb) \u2192 \u2203X(Xa &amp; Xb)\u2019 with explicit first-order\nquantification over sets, as in \u2018(Fa &amp; Fb) \u2192\n\u2203s(a\u2208s &amp; b\u2208s)\u2019; where \u2018\u2208\u2019\nstands for \u2018is an element of\u2019, and this second conditional\nis not a logical truth, but rather a hypothesis (to be evaluated\nholistically) concerning sets.</p>", "<p>\nThe preference for first-order regimentations has come to seem\nunwarranted, or at least highly tendentious; see Boolos (1998). But it\nfueled the idea that logical form can diverge wildly from grammatical\nform. For as students quickly learn, first-order regimentations of\nnatural sentences often turn out to be highly artificial. (And in some\ncases, such regimentations seem to be unavailable.) This was, however,\ntaken to show that natural languages are far from ideal for purposes\nof indicating logical structure.</p>", "<p>\nA different strand of thought in analytic philosophy\u2014pressed by\nWittgenstein in <em>Philosophical Investigations</em> and developed by\nothers, including Strawson and Austin\u2014also suggested that a\nsingle sentence could be used (on different occasions) to express\ndifferent kinds of propositions. Strawson (1950) argued that\n<em>pace</em> Russell, a speaker could use an instance of \u2018The\n<em>F</em> is <em>G</em>\u2019 to express a singular proposition\nabout a specific individual: namely, the <em>F</em> in the context at\nhand.  According to Strawson, sentences themselves do not have truth\nconditions, since sentences (as opposed to speakers) do not express\npropositions; and speakers can use \u2018The boy is tall\u2019 to\nexpress a proposition with the contextually relevant boy as a\nconstituent. Donnellan (1966) went on to argue that a speaker could\neven use an instance of \u2018The <em>F</em> is <em>G</em>\u2019 to\nexpress a singular proposition about an individual that isn't an\n<em>F</em>; see the entry on <a href=\"../reference/\">reference</a>.\nSuch considerations, which have received a great deal of attention in\nrecent discussions of context dependence, suggested that relations\nbetween natural language sentences and propositions are (at best) very\ncomplex and mediated by speakers' intentions. All of which made it\nseem that such relations are far more tenuous than the pre-Fregean\ntradition suggested. This bolstered the Quine/Carnap idea that\nquestions about the structure of premises and conclusions are really\nquestions about how we <em>should</em> talk (when trying to describe\nthe world), much as logic itself seems to be more concerned with how\nwe should infer than with how we do infer. From this perspective, the\nconnections between logic and grammar seemed rather shallow.</p>", "<p> On the other hand, more recent work on quantifiers suggests that\nthe divergence had been exaggerated, in part because of how Frege's\nidea of variable-binding was originally implemented. Consider again\nthe proposition that some boy sang, and the proposed logical division\ninto the quantifier and the rest: \u2203x[Boy(x) &amp; Sang(x)];\nsomething is both a boy and an individual that sang.  This is one way\nto regiment the English sentence. But one can also offer a logical\nparaphrase that more closely parallels the grammatical division\nbetween \u2018some boy\u2019 and \u2018sang\u2019: for some\nindividual x such that x is a boy, x sang. One can formalize this\nparaphrase with restricted quantifiers, which incorporate a\nrestriction on the domain over which the variable in question\nranges. For example, \u2018\u2203x:B(x)\u2019 can be an existential\nquantifier that binds a variable ranging over the boys in the relevant\ndomain, with \u2018\u2203x:B(x)[S(x)]\u2019 being true iff some boy\nsang. Since \u2018\u2203x:B(x)[S(x)]\u2019 and \u2018\u2203x[B(x)\n&amp; S(x)]\u2019 are logically equivalent, logic provides no reason\nfor preferring the latter regimentation of the English sentence. And\nchoosing the latter does not show that the proposition expressed with\n\u2018Some boy sang\u2019 has a structure that differs from\ngrammatical structure of the sentence.</p>", "<p>Universal quantifiers can also be restricted, as in\n\u2018\u2200x:B(x)[S(x)]\u2019, interpreted as follows: for every\nindividual x such that x is a boy, x sang.  Restrictors can also be\nlogically complex, as in \u2018Some boy from Canada sang\u2019 or\n\u2018Some boy who respects Mary sang\u2019, rendered as\n\u2018\u2203x:B(x) &amp; F(x, c)[S(x)]\u2019 and\n\u2018\u2203x:B(x) &amp; R(x, m)[S(x)]\u2019. Given these\nrepresentations, the inferential difference between \u2018some boy\nsang\u2019 and \u2018every boy sang\u2019 lies with the\npropositional contributions of \u2018some\u2019 and\n\u2018every\u2019 after all, and not partly with the contribution of\nconnectives like \u2018&amp;\u2019 and \u2018\u2192\u2019.</p>", "<p> Words like \u2018someone\u2019, and the grammatical requirement\nthat \u2018every\u2019 be followed by a noun (or noun phrase),\nreflect the fact that natural language employs restricted quantifiers.\nPhrases like \u2018every boy\u2019 are composed of a determiner and\na noun. Correspondingly, one can think of determiners as expressions\nthat can combine with an ordered pair of predicates to form a\nsentence, much as one can think of transitive verbs as expressions\nthat can combine with an ordered pair of names to form a sentence. And\nthis grammatical analogy, between determiners and transitive verbs,\nhas a semantic correlate.</p>", "<p>\nSince \u2018x\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019 are variables ranging over\nindividuals, one can say that the function indicated by the transitive\nverb \u2018likes\u2019 yields the value <strong>T</strong> given the\nordered pair \u2329x,y\u232a as argument if and only if x likes y. In\nthis notational scheme, \u2018y\u2019 corresponds to the direct\nobject (or internal argument), which combines with the verb to form a\nphrase; \u2018x\u2019 corresponds to the grammatical subject (or\nexternal argument) of the verb. If we think about \u2018every boy\nsang\u2019 analogously, \u2018boy\u2019 is the internal argument of\n\u2018every\u2019, since \u2018every boy\u2019 is a phrase. By\ncontrast, \u2018boy\u2019 and \u2018sang\u2019 do not form a\nphrase in \u2018every boy sang\u2019. So let us introduce\n\u2018X\u2019 and \u2018Y\u2019 as second-order variables ranging\nover functions, from individuals to truth values, stipulating that the\nextension of such a function is the set of things that the function\nmaps onto the truth value <strong>T</strong>. Then one can say that\nthe function indicated by \u2018every\u2019 yields the value\n<strong>T</strong> given the ordered pair \u2329X, Y\u232a as argument\niff the extension of X includes the extension of Y.  Similarly, one\ncan say that the function indicated by \u2018some\u2019 maps the\nordered pair \u2329X, Y\u232a onto <strong>T</strong> iff the\nextension of X intersects with the extension of Y.</p>", "<p>\nJust as we can describe \u2018likes\u2019 as a predicate satisfied\nby ordered pairs \u2329x, y\u232a such that x likes y, so we can think\nabout \u2018every\u2019 as a predicate satisfied by ordered pairs\n\u2329X, Y\u232a such that the extension of X includes the extension\nof Y. (This is compatible with thinking about \u2018every boy\u2019\nas a restricted quantifier that combines with a predicate to form a\nsentence that is true iff every boy satisfies that predicate.) One\nvirtue of this notational scheme is that it lets us represent\nrelations between predicates that cannot be captured with\n\u2018\u2200\u2019, \u2018\u2203\u2019, and the sentential\nconnectives; see Rescher (1962), Wiggins (1980). For example, most\nboys sang iff the boys who sang outnumber the boys who did not\nsing. So we can say that \u2018most\u2019 indicates a function that\nmaps \u2329X, Y\u232a to <strong>T</strong> iff the number of things\nthat both Y and X map to <strong>T</strong> exceeds the number of\nthings that Y but not X maps to <strong>T</strong>.</p>", "<p>Using restricted quantifiers, and thinking about determiners as\ndevices for indicating relations between functions, also suggests an\nalternative to Russell's treatment of \u2018the\u2019. The formula\n\u2018\u2203x{B(x) &amp; \u2200y[B(y) \u2192 x = y] &amp;\nS(x)}\u2019 can be rewritten as \u2018\u2203x:B(x)[S(x)] &amp; |B|\n= 1\u2019, interpreted as follows: for some individual x such that x\na boy, x sang, and the number of (relevant) boys is exactly one. On\nthis view, \u2018the boy\u2019 still does not correspond to a\nconstituent of the formalism; nor does \u2018the\u2019. But one can\ndepart farther from Russell's notation, while emphasizing his idea\nthat \u2018the\u2019 is relevantly like \u2018some\u2019 and\n\u2018every\u2019. For one can analyze \u2018the boy sang\u2019 as\n\u2018!x:Boy(x)[Sang(x)]\u2019, specifying the propositional\ncontribution of \u2018!\u2019\u2014on a par with as\n\u2018\u2203\u2019 and \u2018\u2200\u2019\u2014as follows:</p>", "<blockquote>!x:Y(x)[X(x)] = <strong>T</strong> iff the extensions of X\nand Y intersect &amp; |Y| = 1.\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThis way of encoding Russell's theory preserves his central claim.\nWhile there may be a certain boy that a speaker refers to in saying\n\u2018The boy sang\u2019, that boy is not a constituent of the\nquantificational proposition expressed with\n\u2018!x:Boy(x)[Sang(x)]\u2019; see Neale (1990) for discussion. But\nfar from showing that the logical form of \u2018The boy sang\u2019\n<em>diverges</em> dramatically from its grammatical form, the\nrestricted quantifier notation suggests that the logical form closely\n<em>parallels </em>the grammatical form. For \u2018the boy\u2019 and\n\u2018the\u2019 do correspond to constituents of\n\u2018!x:B(x)[S(x)]\u2019, at least if we allow for logical forms\nthat represent quantificational propositions in terms of second-order\nrelations; see Montague (1970).</p>", "<p>It is worth noting, briefly, an implication of this point for the\ninference \u2018The boy sang, so some boy sang\u2019. If the logical\nform of \u2018The boy sang\u2019 is \u2018\u2203x:B(x)[S(x)] &amp;\n|B|=1\u2019, then the inference is an instance of the schema\n\u2018<strong>A</strong> &amp; <strong>B</strong>, so\n<strong>A</strong>\u2019. But if the logical form of \u2018The boy\nsang\u2019 is simply \u2018!(x):B(x)[S(x)]\u2019, the premise and\nconclusion have the same form, differing only by substitution of\n\u2018!\u2019 for \u2018\u2203\u2019. In which case, the\nimpeccability of the inference depends on the specific contributions\nof \u2018the/!\u2019 and \u2018some/\u2203\u2019.  Only when\nthese contributions are \u201cspelled out,\u201d perhaps in terms of\nset-intersection, would the validity of the inference be manifest; see King (2002). So\neven if grammar and logic do not diverge in this case, one might say\nthat grammatical structure does not <em>reveal</em> the logical\nstructure. From this perspective, further analysis of\n\u2018the\u2019 is required. Those who are skeptical of an\nanalytic/synthetic distinction can say that it remains more a decision\nthan a discovery to say that \u2018Some boy sang\u2019 follows from\n\u2018The boy sang\u2019. In general, and especially with regard to\naspects of propositional form indicated with individual words, issues\nabout logical form are connected with issues about the\n <a href=\"../analytic-synthetic/\">analytic-synthetic distinction</a>.</p>", "<p> Even given restricted quantifiers (and acceptance of second-order\nlogical forms), the subject/predicate structure of \u2018Juliet /\nlikes every doctor\u2019 diverges from the corresponding formula\nbelow.</p>", "<blockquote> \u2200y:Doctor(y)[Likes(Juliet, y)}.</blockquote>", "<p> We can rewrite \u2018Likes(Juliet, y)\u2019 as\n\u2018[Likes(y)](Juliet)\u2019, to reflect the fact that\n\u2018likes\u2019 combines with a direct object to form a phrase,\nwhich in turn combines with a subject. But this does not affect the\nmain point; \u2018every\u2019 seems to be a grammatical constituent\nof the verb phrase \u2018likes every doctor\u2019, and yet the main\nquantifier of the expressed proposition. In natural language,\n\u2018likes\u2019 and \u2018every doctor\u2019 form a phrase. But\nwith respect to logical form, \u2018likes\u2019 evidently combines\nwith \u2018Juliet\u2019 and a variable to form a complex predicate\nthat is in turn an external argument of the higher-order predicate\n\u2018every\u2019. Similar remarks apply to \u2018Some boy likes\nevery doctor\u2019 and\n\u2018[\u2203x:Boy(x)][\u2200y:Doctor(y)]{Likes(x, y)]\u2019. So\nit seems that mismatches remain in the very places that troubled\nmedieval logicians\u2014viz., quantificational direct objects and\nother examples of complex predicates with quantificational\nconstituents.</p>", "<p>Montague (1970, 1974) showed that these mismatches do not preclude\nsystematic connections of natural language sentences with the\ncorresponding propositional structures. Abstracting from the technical\ndetails, one can specify an algorithm that pairs each natural language\nsentence that contains one or more quantificational expressions like\n\u2018every doctor\u2019 with one or more Fregean logical\nforms. This was a significant advance. Together with subsequent\ndevelopments, Montague's work showed that Frege's logic was compatible\nwith the idea that quantificational constructions in natural language\nhave a systematic semantics. Indeed, one can use Frege's formal\napparatus to study such constructions. Montague himself maintained\nthat the syntax of natural language was misleading for purposes of\n(what he took to be) real semantics. On this view, the study of valid\ninference still suggests that natural language grammar disguises the\nstructure of human thought. But in thinking about the relation of\nlogic to grammar, one should not assume a naive conception of the\nlatter.</p>", "<p>For example, the grammatical form of a sentence need not be\ndetermined by the linear order of its words. Using brackets to\ndisambiguate, we can distinguish the sentence \u2018Mary [saw [the\n[boy [with binoculars]]]]\u2019\u2014whose direct object is\n\u2018the boy with binoculars\u2019\u2014from the homophonous\nsentence \u2018Mary [[saw [the boy]] [with binoculars]]\u2019, in\nwhich \u2018saw the boy\u2019 is modified by an adverbial\nphrase. The first implies that the boy had binoculars, while the\nsecond implies that Mary used binoculars to see the boy. This\ndistinction may not be audibly marked.  Nonetheless, there is a\ndifference between modifying a noun (like \u2018boy\u2019) with a\nprepositional phrase and modifying a verb phrase (\u2018saw the\nboy\u2019). More generally, grammatical structure need not be\nobvious. Just as it may take work to discover the kind(s) of structure\nthat propositions exhibit, so it may take work to discover the kind(s)\nof structure that sentences exhibit. And many studies of natural\nlanguage suggest a rich conception of grammatical form that diverges\nfrom traditional views; see especially Chomsky (1957, 1965, 1981,\n1986, 1995). So we need to ask how logical forms are related to actual\ngrammatical forms, which linguists try to discover, since these may\ndiffer importantly from any hypothesized grammatical forms that may be\nsuggested by casual reflection on spoken language.  Appearances may be\nmisleading with respect to both grammatical and logical form, leaving\nroom for the possibility that these notions of structure are not so\ndifferent after all.</p>", "<p>A leading idea of modern linguistics is that at least some\ngrammatical structures are transformations of others. Put another way,\nlinguistic expressions often appear to be displaced from the positions\ncanonically associated with certain grammatical relations that the\nexpressions exhibit.

So an introductory\ndiscussion of logical form would not be complete without some hint of\nwhy such work is relevant, especially since attending to details of\nnatural languages (as opposed to languages invented to study the\nfoundations of arithmetic) led to renewed discussion of how to\nrepresent propositions that involve relations.</p>", "<p>Prima facie, \u2018Every old patient respects some doctor\u2019\nand \u2018Some young politician likes every liar\u2019 exhibit\ncommon modes of linguistic combination.

It may be hard to see\nhow this hypothesis could be true if there are widespread mismatches\nbetween logical and grammatical form. But it is also hard to see how\nthe hypothesis could be false. Children, who have finite cognitive\nresources, typically acquire the capacity to understand the endlessly\nmany expressions of the languages spoken around them.

Davidson (1967a) conjectured that one could do\nfor English what Tarski did for the predicate calculus; and Montague,\nsimilarly inspired by Tarski, showed how one could start dealing with\npredicates that have quantificational constituents.

But given any such representation, adverbs like\n\u2018quickly\u2019 and \u2018at midnight\u2019 can be analyzed as\nadditional predicates of events, as shown in (37a-39a).</p>", "<blockquote>\n  <table>\n    <tbody>\n      <tr valign=\"top\">\n        <td>(37a)</td>\n        <td>\u2203e[Agent(e, Juliet) &amp;\nKissing(e) &amp; Patient(e, Romeo) &amp;\nQuick(e) &amp; At-midnight(e)]</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr valign=\"top\">\n        <td>(38a)</td>\n        <td>\u2203e[Agent(e, Juliet) &amp;\nKissing(e) &amp; Patient(e, Romeo) &amp;\nQuick(e)]</td>\n      </tr>\n      <tr valign=\"top\">\n        <td>(39a)</td>\n        <td>\u2203e[Agent(e, Juliet) &amp;\nKissing(e) &amp; Patient(e, Romeo) &amp;\nAt-midnight(e)]</td>\n      </tr>\n    </tbody>\n  </table>\n</blockquote>", "<p> If this is correct, then the inference from (37) to (40) is an\ninstance of the following valid form: \u2203e[...e... &amp; Q(e)\n&amp; A(e))]; hence, \u2203e[...e...]. The other impeccable\ninferences involving (37\u201340) can likewise be viewed as instances\nof conjunction reduction. If the grammatical form of (40) is simply\n\u2018{Juliet [kissed Romeo]}\u2019, then the mapping from\ngrammatical to logical form is not transparent; and natural language\nis misleading, in that no word corresponds to the event\nquantifier. But this does not posit a significant structural mismatch\nbetween grammatical and logical form. On the contrary, each word in\n(40) corresponds to a conjunct in (40a). This suggests a strategy for\nthinking about how the meaning of a sentence like (40) might be\ncomposed from the meanings of the constituent words. A growing body of\nliterature, in philosophy and linguistics, suggests that Davidson's\nproposal captures an important feature of natural language semantics,\nand that \u201cevent analyses\u201d provide a useful framework for\nfuture discussions of logical form.</p>", "<p>In one sense, it is an ancient idea that action reports like (40)\nrepresent individuals as participating in events; see Gillon's (2007)\ndiscussion of Panini's grammar of Sanskrit. But if (40) can be glossed\nas \u2018Juliet did some kissing, and Romeo was thereby\nkissed\u2019, perhaps the ancient idea can be deployed in developing\nLeibniz' suggestion that relational sentences like (40) somehow\ncontain simpler active-voice and passive-voice sentences; cp. Kratzer\n(1996). And perhaps appeals to quantifier raising can help in\ndefending the idea that \u2018Juliet kissed <em>some/the/every</em>\nboy\u2019 is, after all, a sentence that exhibits\nSubject-copula-Predicate form: \u2018[<em>some/the/every</em>\nboy]<sub><i>i</i></sub> is <em>P</em>\u2019, with\n\u2018<em>P</em>\u2019 as a complex predicate akin to \u2018[some\nevent]<sub><i>e</i></sub> was both a kissing done by Juliet and one in\nwhich he<sub><i>i</i></sub> was kissed\u2019.</p>", "<p>With this in mind, let's return to the idea that each complex\nexpression of natural language has semantic properties that are\ndetermined by (i) the semantic properties of its constituents, and\n(ii) the ways in which these constituents are grammatically\narranged. If this is correct, then following Davidson, one might say\nthat the logical forms of expressions (of some natural language) just\nare the structures that determine the corresponding meanings given the\nrelevant word meanings; see Lepore and Ludwig (2002). In which case,\nthe phenomenon of valid inference may be largely a by-product of\nsemantic compositionality. If principles governing the meanings of\n(37\u201340) have the consequence that (40) is true iff an\nexistential claim like (40a) is true, perhaps this is illustrative of\nthe general case. Given a sentence of some natural language NL, the\ntask of specifying its logical form may be inseparable from the task\nof providing a compositional specification of what the sentences of NL\nmean.</p>", "<p>At this point, many issues become relevant to further discussions\nof logical form. Most obviously, there are questions concerning\nparticular examples. Given just about any sentence of natural\nlanguage, one can ask interesting questions (that remain unsettled)\nabout its logical form. There are also very abstract questions about\nthe relation of semantics to logic. Should we follow Davidson and\nMontague, among others, in characterizing theories of meaning for\nnatural languages as theories of truth (that perhaps satisfy certain\nconditions on learnability)? Is an algorithm that correctly associates\nsentences with truth-conditions (relative to contexts) necessary\nand/or sufficient for being an adequate theory of meaning? What should\nwe say about the paradoxes apparently engendered by sentences like\n\u2018This sentence is false\u2019? If we allow for second-order\nlogical forms, how should we understand second-order quantification,\ngiven Russell's Paradox?  Are claims about the \u201csemantic\nstructure\u201d of a sentence fundamentally descriptive claims about\nspeakers (or their communities, or their languages)? Or is there an\nimportant sense in which claims about semantic structure are normative\nclaims about how we should use language? Are facts about the\nacquisition of language germane to hypotheses about logical form? And\nof course, the history of the subject reveals that the answers to the\ncentral questions are by no means obvious: what is logical structure,\nwhat is grammatical structure, and how are they related? Or put\nanother way, what kinds of structures do propositions and sentences\nexhibit, and how do thinkers/speakers relate them?</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "logical-form"]}
{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religious-language/", "title": "Religious Language", "text": ["<p>\nA useful starting point for thinking about religious language is a\n<em>face value</em> theory that promises to give an interpretation of\nreligious sentences and utterances that adheres as closely as possible\nto what they appear to say. Take, for instance, the affirmation of an\nindicative religious sentence such as</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag2em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(1)</span><span class=\"sen\">God is\nomnipotent</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nAccording to the face value theory, (1) has various apparent\ncharacteristics: (a) It has the propositional\u2014or\n\u201clinguistic\u201d or \u201csemantic\u201d\u2014content\n<em>that God is omnipotent</em> and is true just in case God is\nomnipotent; (b) it is an assertion that conventionally expresses the\nspeaker\u2019s belief that God is omnipotent; (c) it is a descriptive\nutterance that represents (truly or falsely) the fact that God is\nomnipotent, just as other descriptive utterances in other fields of\ndiscourse (in science, history, etc.) represent facts. For proponents\nof face value theory, generalisations of (a), (b) and (c) that extend\nto indicative religious utterances such as (1)\u2014(a*), (b*) and\n(c*) respectively\u2014provide the starting point for the\ninterpretation of religious discourse. It should be treated in the\nsame way as the interpretation of other descriptive areas of\ndiscourse: there\u2019s nothing special about religious discourse\nother than its distinctive subject matter.</p>", "<p>\nThe face value theory will, of course, need more development if it is\nto explain other areas of religious discourse. The approach taken to\n(1) clearly does not apply to non-literal or non-assertoric religious\nutterances, such as metaphors, questions, fictional stories,\nexpressions of hope, or devotion. However, these are all forms of\nexpression that occur outside religious discourse; they are not unique\nto religion. For the face value theory, the treatment of religious\ncases will fall in line with the treatment of non-literal and\nnon-assertoric communication more generally. So, other than the fact\nthat religious discourse is about God, the afterlife and so on, there\nis nothing remarkable or distinctive in the interpretation of\nreligious utterances.</p>", "<p>\nA large part of research on religious language has been concerned with\nwhether one or more of (a*), (b*) and (c*) ought plausibly to be\nrejected. Indeed, the attention that some theories of religious\nlanguage receive is in part due to their divergence from a face value\ninterpretation. Most of the theories that are discussed within the\nfield reject at least one of the components of face value theory.</p>", "<p>\nThe most radical rejection of face value theory is the denial of (a*),\ni.e., that religious utterances express religious\n propositions.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-1\" id=\"ref-1\">1</a>]</sup>\n These theories will be explored in\n <a href=\"#ContReliUtte\">section 2</a>.\n The most famous example of this position is Ayer\u2019s version\nlogical positivism\n (<a href=\"#AyerVeri\">2.1</a>).\n Non-cognitive accounts, from which we have selected Braithwaite\n (<a href=\"#ReliPlanRBBrai\">2.2.1</a>)\n and Berkeley\n (<a href=\"#MixeStraGeorBerk\">2.2.2</a>),\n are similarly radical but are differently motivated and offer a more\npositive alternative account of the meaning of religious utterances.\nThe prospects for a more sophisticated non-cognitivism are considered\nin\n <a href=\"#ProsForReliNonCogn\">2.2.3.</a>\n A third class of theories\n (<a href=\"#ParaCont\">2.3</a>),\n propose that religious utterances are paradoxical or fail to express\ncomplete propositions.

Instead, their truth conditions are given by\n\u201creduced\u201d (typically non-religious) sentences.</p>", "<p>\n\n <a href=\"#UseReliLang\">Section 3</a>\n will look at theories that reject (b*), i.e., that indicative\nstatements affirmed about God are not literal assertions.\n <a href=\"#AnalMeta\">3.1</a>\n will review metaphor theories, encompassing a discussion of analogy.\nInterpretations of religious discourse as a form of praise or prayer,\nsuggested by Jean-Luc Marion and Jacques Derrida, will be considered\nin\n <a href=\"#PraiPray\">3.2.</a>\n These theories propose that despite appearing to literally assert\nreligious sentences, speakers are instead employing a different type\nof speech act. An alternative approach is to argue that religious\nutterances are avowed for practical reasons rather than their truth.\nIan Ramsey\n (<a href=\"#Fict\">3.3</a>)\n takes this approach, as do hermeneutic fictionalists\n (<a href=\"#ReliPurp\">3.4</a>).</p>", "<p>\nMinimalists\n (<a href=\"#MiniAbouReli\">4.1</a>)\n agree that indicative religious utterances are representational and\nassertoric but deny that they represent religious facts in the way\nthat other areas of descriptive discourse represent facts.

First, he offers no positive alternative account of the\nmeaning of religious utterances. Ayer saw little value in religious\ndiscourse and preferred its elimination. In contrast, the other\ntheories considered in this section propose that religious language\nmay be meaningful even if it does not express religious propositions.\nVarious options have been proposed: it may express non-cognitive\nstates, have a practical value in modifying the thought and action of\nspeakers, or represent non-religious facts. Second, Ayer\u2019s\naccount is ostensibly comprehensive for religious language whereas\nmost other theories are more piecemeal, that is, they reject (a*) for\nsome significant subclass of religious utterances but for other\nreligious utterances accept face value theory.</p>", "<p>\nThe verificationist theory of meaning was popularised by A.J. Ayer in\nhis 1936 <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em>. Ayer argues that\nreligious <em>statements</em>\u2014his term for indicative\nsentences\u2014are \u201cliterally meaningless\u201d. According to\nAyer, a statement is factually contentful if and only if it is\nempirically verifiable. A statement is empirically verifiable if what\nit says can in principle be shown to be true or false by observation.\nAlthough logically necessary statements are not verifiable, according\nto Ayer they are analytic or true by virtue of the meaning of their\nconstituent terms. As such, \u201cnone of them provide any\ninformation about any matter of fact\u201d (1936: 79). Ayer encapsulated the\nverificationist theory of meaning with the infamous <em>empirical\nverification principle</em>: to have literal meaning a statement must\nbe either analytically true (and thereby factually uninformative) or\nempirically verifiable.</p>", "<p>\nAyer\u2019s chief target is metaphysics and he rather ambitiously\ntitled the first chapter of his book \u201cThe Elimination of\nMetaphysics\u201d. Metaphysics is taken to be made up of statements\nthat concern the nature of reality that falls beyond the scope of\nscientific inquiry. Examples include the existence of the external\nworld, the number of substances that there are in the world, whether\nthe world is made up of ideas and the reality of propositions or\nuniversals. Because theories on these issues are not empirically\nverifiable, Ayer takes them to lack \u201cfactual meaning\u201d:\nthey should be eliminated as a topic of debate. Other conspicuous\nvictims of the application of the verification principle were ethical,\naesthetic and religious statements all of which, so Ayer argues, are\nnot susceptible to verification and are thereby similarly factually\nmeaningless.</p>", "<p>\nNotably, however, Ayer has a positive \u201cemotivist\u201d story to\ntell about ethical statements. Although he takes ethical statements to\nbe unverifiable descriptions of normative facts, from which he\nconcludes that an ethical predicate \u201cadds nothing to the literal\nmeaning of the sentence\u201d, he argues that ethical language has a\nnon-descriptive function of expressing approval or disapproval as well\nas encouraging attitudes of approval or disapproval in others. For\nexample, in saying \u201cStealing money is wrong\u201d, the speaker\ndoes not say something that is true or false but expresses disapproval\ntowards stealing (1936: 107). Ayer extends his emotivism to aesthetic language: it is\nused \u201csimply to express certain feelings and evoke a certain\nresponse\u201d (1936: 113). What of religious language? Ayer is silent on this\nissue, implying that religious language should be dispensed with in\nthe same way as other areas of metaphysics.</p>", "<p>\nLogical positivism was briefly in vogue in the 1930s but quickly ran\ninto intractable difficulties. That something is seriously awry can be\nseen by subjecting the verification principle to its own standards: it\nis <em>itself</em> neither empirically verifiable nor analytically\ntrue, so literally meaningless according to its own criterion. Ayer\nexacerbated this problem by exaggerated the predicament of statements\nthat failed to satisfy this principle, sometimes characterising them\nas \u201cnonsense\u201d. However, the central reason for the\ntheory\u2019s collapse was the failure to come up with a workable\nversion of the verification principle (see MacDonald 2010 for a\nreview). Ayer was unable to find a happy medium between a strict\nformulation that renders statements of scientific theory unverifiable\nand a lax formulation that allows <em>any</em> statement to be\nverifiable.</p>", "<p>\nThis brings us to the question of why religious statements should be\nheld by to fall foul of the verification principle. Why can\u2019t\nreligious statements legitimately be regarded as scientific hypotheses\n(as Swinburne 1994, among others, argues)? Religious statements do in\nmany cases appear to have implications for what is or should be\nobservable. We can predict, for instance, that a world created by God\nwill exhibit various kinds of orderliness. It seems, therefore, that\nsome religious statements should be in a good a position to satisfy\nthe standards of literal content set up by the empirical verification\nprinciple. Ayer\u2019s reply to this argument is surprisingly terse.\nSuppose, he argues, that \u201cGod exists\u201d entails that there\nshould be observable regularities in nature. If that exhausted the\nobservable results of \u201cGod exists\u201d then \u201cto assert\nthe existence of a god will be simply equivalent to asserting that\nthere is the requisite regularity in nature\u201d (1936: 115). Clearly, Ayer contends, this\nis not all that religious believers intend to assert in saying that\nGod exists: they are committed to the existence of an unverifiable\nsupernatural agent.</p>", "<p>\nAyer\u2019s response seems to involve a sleight of hand. The\nverification principle is presented as a way of demarcating factually\ncontentful from contentless statements. In arguing against the\nverifiability of religious statements, Ayer relies on the assumption\nthat the verification principle provides the means for specifying what\nstatements mean. In this case, that the content of \u201cGod\nexists\u201d is exhausted by the observation statements that (in\ncombination with other assumptions) can be deduced from it. However,\nthis is in effect to concede that religious statements <em>are</em>\nverifiable according to the original (official) version of the\nverification principle. As to the meaning-specifying, unofficial\nversion of the verification principle, this is not something that Ayer\ndefends. However, it would place religious statements in good company\nwith scientific statements that posit theoretical entities that are\nnot directly observable and the meanings of which are similarly not\nexhausted by the observation statements that are derivable from\nthem.</p>", "<p>\nDespite the availability of conclusive objections to Ayer, worries\nabout the verifiability (or falsifiability) of religious statements\ncontinued to exert a remarkable influence on work in the philosophy of\nreligion, with papers and books being produced well into the second\nhalf of the twentieth century. Examples include Flew and MacIntyre\n(1955), Ferr\u00e9 (1962), Macquarrie (1967), Donovan (1976) and Tilley (1978); for a\ndiscussion of this prolonged impact see Scott (2013: 45\u201348).</p>", "<h4 id=\"ReliPlanRBBrai\">2.2.1 Religious Plans: R. B. Braithwaite</h4>", "<p>\nAyer argues that although ethical statements are not descriptive they\nhave the important function of giving voice to our non-cognitive\nattitudes of approval and disapproval. However, he offers no positive\nnon-cognitive theory of the meaning of religious statements.\nBraithwaite addresses this asymmetry with a non-cognitivist account of\nreligious language. His theory is modelled on Ayer\u2019s ethical\nemotivism but with\n modifications.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-2\" id=\"ref-2\">2</a>]</sup>\n Braithwaite takes the same approach to religious statements. He\nproposes that religious statements are \u201cprimarily declarations\nof adherence to a policy of action, declarations of commitment to a\nway of life\u201d (1955: 15). For example, \u201cGod is love\u201d\nexpresses the intention to follow an agapeistic way of life. Religious\ndiscourse concerned with matters that are not directly concerned with\nbehavioural conduct, such as claims about important religious figures,\nparables, accounts of the creation, and so on, Braithwaite calls\n<em>stories</em>. These stories, according to Braithwaite, provide\nmodels of exemplary behaviour (or behaviour to avoid) that serve as\npsychological assistance for the believer to act on their intentions.\nFor this reason, their truth is not crucial to the action-guiding role\nthat they play: they are entertained rather than believed (1955: 24).\nBraithwaite combines a non-cognitive theory of a range of core\nreligious judgements and doctrinal claims with a theory of religious\n\u201cstories\u201d as useful fictions. </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nA religious belief is an intention to behave in a certain way (a moral\nbelief) together with the entertainment of certain stories associated\nwith the intention in the mind of the believer. (1955: 32)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nTo the extent that the negative part of Braithwaite\u2019s\nposition\u2014that religious utterances lack factual\nsignificance\u2014relies on Ayer\u2019s verificationism, his theory\nencounters similar problems. However, the positive part of\nBraithwaite\u2019s theory also runs into difficulties both for its\npsychological implausability (Swinburne 1993: ch. 6) and as a theory\nof religious language (Scott 2013: ch. 4). Here is one objection. What\nare the intentions expressed by different religious statements?\nBraithwaite is rather sketchy on the details but he proposes that\n<em>Christian</em> statements express an intention to pursue an\nagapeistic way of life (1955: 21\u201322). However, equipped with\nonly <em>one</em> plan, Braithwaite\u2019s theory will have\n<em>all</em> Christian claims (or at least all doctrinal claims)\nmeaning the same. They will all express an intention to pursue the\nsame plan. Even if Braithwaite could identify some additional plans\nthere seems no prospect of finding plans to individuate the meanings\nof all statements of Christian belief.</p>", "<h4 id=\"MixeStraGeorBerk\">2.2.2 Mixed Strategies: George Berkeley</h4>", "<p>\nGeorge Berkeley offers the most detailed and important account of\nreligious language of any of the major early modern philosophers.\nThese are elaborated in his 1732 dialogue <em>Alciphron</em>. His\naccount has negative and positive elements. First, he rejects (a*) for\na <em>limited</em> range of religious utterances. Specifically,\nChristian doctrinal concerns about grace, original sin, the afterlife\nand other Christian \u201cmysteries\u201d. Regarding the rest of\nreligious discourse, Berkeley offers a thoroughly cognitive account:\nreligious terms\u2014and in particular\n\u201cGod\u201d\u2014correspond to ideas that refer to really\nexisting features of reality. Moreover, Berkeley believes many\nChristian claims are not only cognitively contentful but also\nrationally defensible. Second, he proposes that this limited group of\nutterances should be interpreted non-cognitively: they do not\nrepresent facts but evoke various attitudes and practical\ndispositions.</p>", "<p>\nIn a part of the dialogue concerned with the Christian doctrine of\ngrace, Berkeley attributes two arguments to the sceptical interlocutor\nAlciphron. First, when we consider the meaning of the word\n\u201cgrace\u201d we find a \u201cperfect vacuity or privation of\nideas\u201d; it is an \u201cempty name\u201d ([1732] 1950: 290).\nSecond, in saying that grace \u201cacts\u201d or\n\u201ccauses\u201d things to happen, we are employing words that are\nclear and intelligible when used to describe the behaviour of physical\nobjects but have no similarly clear significations when applied to a\n\u201cspiritual\u201d matters. In supposing that talk of the\ncausally efficacious properties of grace is contentful, speakers are\nunjustifiably trading on the familiar meanings of these words when\ntalking about physical properties and causal relations between\nphysical objects; when used to elaborate on the nature of grace or\ndescribe its nature, these words do not have a clear sense. We have,\nconcludes Alciphron, no clear idea corresponding to the word\n\u201cgrace\u201d; we \u201ccannot assent to any proposition\nconcerning it\u201d or have any faith about it. Berkeley, through the\ninterlocutor Euphranor, rejects Alciphron\u2019s conclusion but\n<em>concedes</em> Alciphron\u2019s arguments that the word\n\u201cgrace\u201d does not suggest a clear idea. Nevertheless, a\ndiscourse \u201cthat directs how to act or excites to the doing or\nforbearance of an action may \u2026 be useful and\nsignificant\u201d\u2014and express faith\u2014even if it is not\nrepresentational ([1732] 1950: 292).</p>", "<p>\nBerkeley goes on to develop his non-representation account not just\nfor grace but a variety of Christian doctrines. Talking of grace has a\npractical role in encouraging conduct in accordance with Christian\nfaith: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nGrace may \u2026 be an object of our faith, and influence our life\nand actions, as a principle destructive of evil habits and productive\nof good ones, although we cannot attain a distinct idea of it. ([1732]\n1950: 296) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nHe takes a similar approach to the Trinity: we lack a clear idea of\nwhat it is, but talk of it is significant because of its practical\nrole in modifying the attitudes and conduct of the faithful ([1732]\n1950: 297). Original sin receives a similar treatment. In general,\ntalk of the \u201creligious mysteries\u201d, according to Berkeley,\nserves a practical function of motivating and guiding the faithful to\nthink and act according to Christian principles. They are\n\u201cplaced in the will and affections rather than in the\nunderstanding, and producing holy lives rather than subtle\ntheories\u201d ([1732] 1950: 301).</p>", "<p>\nOne of the distinctive characteristics of Berkeley\u2019s account is\nhis attempt to develop a non-cognitive theory for only a limited\nregion of religious language, while retaining a cognitivist account\nfor the rest. Let\u2019s call this a <em>mixed</em> theory. There are\ntwo pressing problems for a mixed theory. First, how should we\ndifferentiate areas of religious language which should be given a face\nvalue interpretation from those that should be given a non-cognitive\ninterpretation? Second, how are the non-cognitive areas of religious\nlanguage meaningfully related to the cognitive areas of language?\nBerkeley answers the first problem by an introspective experiment. We\nreflect on what we are thinking when we talk about the Christian\nmysteries and find that we lack clear ideas or beliefs. However, this\nis unsatisfactory. There is no general agreement on which religious\nexpressions or sentences we are sufficiently clear about to make them\nsuitable vehicles for expressing religious beliefs. Nor does Berkeley\nidentify anything that specifically characterises the Christian\nmysteries as matters on which speakers have much less clear ideas than\nmany of the other ideas that form part of religious judgements, not\nleast the ideas of God and divine properties. Berkeley does not,\ntherefore, have a successful method for discriminating religious ideas\nand thoughts that are cognitively contentful from those that are\nnot.</p>", "<p>\nOn the second problem, suppose for example we follow Berkeley giving a\nface value account of</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag2em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(4)</span><span class=\"sen\">God is\ngood</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nand a non-cognitive interpretation of</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag2em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(5)</span><span class=\"sen\">Salvation is given\nby divine grace.</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nThat is, (5) does not have a propositional content but is used to\nencourage faith and virtue. How should (6), be interpreted?</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag2em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(6)</span><span class=\"sen\">If God is good then\nsalvation is given by divine grace.</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nThe mixed theory has two problems. This sentence combines (4) and (5)\nin a conditional sentence but since the consequent is taken to express\nan attitude it is unclear how it should be understood. This is because\none can assert (6) without expressing the attitude in (5); one might,\nfor example, think that the antecedent and consequent are false but\nnevertheless think that (6) is true because <em>if</em> the antecedent\nwere true then the consequent would be true. It seems, therefore, that\nif the mixed theorist is right that (5) expresses a non-cognitive\nattitude then it must have a different meaning in (6) where it is not\ntied to the expression of any attitude. This brings us to a second\nproblem, which is that (4) and (6) together entail (5). Together these\nsentences make an evidently valid modus ponens argument. However, if\n(5) means something different when asserted and when embedded in the\nconditional (6), then this argument is invalid. More generally, the\nmixed theory looks in difficulty when trying to explain the meaning of\nconditionals or valid arguments that contain expressive and cognitive\nreligious sentences.</p>", "<h4 id=\"ProsForReliNonCogn\">2.2.3 The Prospects for Religious Non-Cognitivism</h4>", "<p>\nSome of the problems with Berkeley\u2019s theory arise from its\nlimited application to only parts of religious language. This raises\nthe question of whether a more thoroughgoing non-cognitivist theory of\nreligious language could be developed, perhaps employing the methods\ndeveloped in the defence of current expressivist theories of ethics.\nThe prospects for such a theory remain relatively unexplored territory\nbut here are a couple of relevant consideration, one in favour and one\nagainst.</p>", "<p>\nAn important part of religious discourse is the communication of\nfaithful attitudes. Moreover, faith is a state that appears to be\nintrinsically connected to our motivations and feelings. This is\nsomething that Berkeley makes great play of: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nFaith, I say, is not an indolent perception, but an operative\npersuasion of mind, which ever worketh some suitable action,\ndisposition, or emotion in those who have it; as it were easy to prove\nand illustrate by innumerable instances taken from human affairs.\n([1732] 1950: 301) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThe idea that idea that faith must have a practical element commands\nbroad support. Faith is said to be intrinsically motivational (Bishop\n2007: 105\u2013106), to involve desires (MacDonald 1993: 44;\nHoward-Snyder 2013: 363), plans and commitments (Swinburne 2005:\n211\u2013212; Kvanvig\n2013: 111), stances (Callahan &amp; O\u2019Connor 2014: 13\u201314)\npro-attitudes (Audi 2011: 67; Alston 1996: 12\u201313; Schellenberg\n2014: 83). Berkeley sees it as one of the main selling points of his\nnon-cognitivism that it explains why faith in religious mysteries\nshould have practical effects on the dispositions and behaviour of the\nfaithful and lead people to change their lives ([1732] 1950, VII.10).\nMore generally, it appears that there are at least the rudimentary\ncomponents for an argument akin to the argument from motivational\nforce used to support ethical non-cognitivism (see van Roojen 2016).\nThis offers one potentially promising line of argument for the\nnon-cognitivist to pursue. Note that religious utterances need not be\nexclusively either cognitive or non-cognitive. It is possible to argue\nthat religious utterances conventionally express both non-cognitive\nattitudes and beliefs (for a defence of this position see Scott 2013:\n71\u201385).</p>", "<p>\nThere are general objections to ethical and other varieties of\nnon-cognitivism\u2014most notably the Frege-Geach and the\n\u201cembedding\u201d problems (see Schroeder 2010 for an\noverview)\u2014that will equally apply to a putative expressivist\naccount of religious language. However, a thoroughgoing religious\nnon-cognitivism will face the additional problem of identifying the\nrelevant attitudes and plans that are expressed in religious\nutterances. While there are attitudes that might be considered\ncharacteristic of religious language\u2014for instance, awe, devotion\nand obedience\u2014it is difficult to see how such attitudes could\nprovide the resources to provide a plausible account of the meaning of\nreligious utterances or to individuate the meanings of different\nreligious utterances. To take just one example, \u201cGod is\nomniscient\u201d will need to be expressive of a distinct\nnon-cognitive attitude to \u201cGod is omnipresent\u201d to\ndistinguish their meanings.</p>", "<p>\nSome of the claims most commonly made about God\u2019s nature and\ndoctrinal claims, particularly those of Christianity, have been said\nto be absurd, paradoxical or impossible to understand. The most\nfamiliar version of this worry concerns the consistency of the\npredicates ascribed to God such as omnipotence and doctrinal views\nsuch as the Trinity. Considerable effort has been directed towards\nestablishing that religious claims are coherent (for example,\nSwinburne 1994). Those who concede that some religious claims are\nparadoxical have proposed a variety of different responses. Paradox in\nreligious claims has been seen as grounds for atheism (Martin 1990),\nfor modifying religious doctrine or changing our attitudes towards\nthem (Hick 1977: 1993), or as an ineliminable part of faith\n(Kierkegaard [1844] 1985; see Evans 1989). However, there is a further\nquestion about what such claims mean. If we take paradoxical\nutterances (or ones that are in some way absurd or impossible to\nunderstand) as failing to express propositions, then allowing that\nsome of the principal expressions of faith are paradoxical (or absurd\nor impossible to understand) is thereby to reject (a*).</p>", "<p>\nA number of accounts of religious language appear potentially\nsympathetic with this approach. For example, Ronald Hepburn\n(1958)\u2014according to whom \u201cparadoxical and near-paradoxical\nlanguage is the <em>staple</em> of accounts of God\u2019s\nnature\u201d (16)\u2014proposes that religious ideas and stories may\nhave the role of imaginatively informing a moral way of life. This\nview has some similarities with fictionalism, discussed below. More\nrecently, Stephen Mulhall (2015) has suggested that some religious\nutterances can be understood as unresolvable riddles the meanings of\nwhich we are unable to grasp fully, inviting an open-ended process of\narticulating their meaning that is pursued by those engaged in\nreligious discourse.</p>", "<p>\nAlso relevant here are the works of authors in the apophatic and\nmystical tradition that was particularly prominent from mid-antiquity\nthrough to the late medieval period. Although a variety of accounts of\nreligious language are suggested by the writings of authors in this\ntradition, some of what they say appears sympathetic to paradoxicalism\nabout utterances about God\u2019s nature. Two themes that are found\nin their writings are particularly notable. First, God\u2019s nature\nis taken to be both inconceivable and inexpressible (Dionysius <em>The\nMystical Theology</em>: ch. 5; Gregory of Nyssa <em>Contra Eunomium\nII</em>: 61; Maximus the Confessor, <em>Chapters on Knowledge</em>:\npart one 1\u20132, part two 2; Maimonides, <em>The Guide of the\nPerplexed</em>: ch. 58). It appears to follow from this that in\nsaying, for example, \u201cGod is good\u201d, one does not succeed\nin representing God in either thought or language. A second theme\nfound in some apophatic writers is that an important aspect of\nreligious engagement is establishing a secure relationship with\nGod\u2014sometimes characterised as an \u201cascent\u201d to God\n(Dionysius <em>The Mystical Theology</em>: ch. 1.1; <em>Cloud of\nUnknowing</em>: ch. 4)\u2014and a recognition of the abject failure\nof what we say to communicate any representation of God\u2019s nature\nmay form part of that process. Far from being pointless, religious\ndiscourse about God may assist in the recognition of our intellectual\nand linguistic limitations (<em>Cloud of Unknowing</em>: ch. 8). For\nfurther discussion and other interpretations of these works see Turner\n1995 and for a detailed review focused on religious language see Scott\nand Citron 2016.</p>", "<p>\nOne difficulty that might be pressed by supporters of the face value\ntheory is these theories, as least to the extent that they are\nproviding accounts of religious language, appear revisionary rather\nthan descriptive of the meanings of religious utterances. For example,\nthe proposal that \u201cGod is good\u201d does not simply express\nthe proposition that God is good seems, in the case of apophaticism,\nto be based on a contentious theological view about what can be\nrepresented in thought and language rather than what speakers mean\nwhen they utter this sentence. The sentence is used in a variety of\napparently descriptive ways by speakers: it is said to be true (or\nfalse), it is used in apparently valid arguments, can be embedded in a\nconditional, it is said to be a matter of belief or even of knowledge.\nAny account of religious language will need to do justice to the\nevidence that religious utterances are used descriptively,\nparticularly ones that put (a*) into question.</p>", "<p>\nA variety of philosophical positions go by the name\n\u201creductionism\u201d but reductionist theories of language aim\nto give the truth conditions for sentences that are apparently about a\ncertain range of phenomena in terms of sentences about some other\nrange of phenomena. We can call these (following Dummett 1991: 322)\nthe <em>disputed</em> and <em>reduced</em> class of sentences\nrespectively. Commonly discussed examples include logical behaviourism\n(see Graham 2017), which reduces sentences about mental states to ones\nabout behaviour, and temporal reductionism (see Markosian 2016) which\nproposes that sentences about time can be reduced to sentences about\ntemporal relations between things and events. Most varieties of\nreligious reductionism posit various naturalistic phenomena as the\nsubject of the reduced class of sentences. Unlike other positions\nconsidered in this section, religious reductionists agree with face\nvalue theories that religious utterances have propositional content,\nhowever, they argue that the content in question is not the face value\nsubject matter but instead the subject matter described by the reduced\nclass of sentences.</p>", "<p>\nA variety of reductionism adopted by early Christian writers in their\ntreatment of pagan religion, such as Lactantius ([4<sup>th</sup>\ncentury] 1871: 22) and Augustine (<em>The City of God</em>, VII ch.\n18), proposes that the pagan deities were based on real, mortal\nhistorical figures revered after their death for their contributions\nto human society and subsequently elevated to the status of gods.\nHowever, this is clearly not a <em>linguistic</em> reductionism.\nAugustine\u2014in a chapter titled \u201cA more credible cause of\nthe pagan error\u201d\u2014aims to discourage and debunk pagan\nbeliefs: they are fictions inspired by the benevolent deeds of mortal\nleaders. Linguistic reductionism does not seek to explain religious\nbelief but identifies a reductive class of sentences by which the\ntruth or falsity of sentences in the disputed class is determined.</p>", "<p>\nLinguistic reductionism has never received widespread support, and has\nnever been developed systematically or comprehensively for religious\nlanguage. Nevertheless, it has an interesting pedigree. For example,\nSpinoza, one of the most influential defenders of pantheism, suggested\nways of interpreting sentences about God in terms of facts about\nnature (Mason 2007). He\nwrites: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nBy God\u2019s direction I mean the fixed and immutable order of\nNature, or chain of natural events \u2026 So it is the same thing\nwhether we say that all things happen according to Nature\u2019s laws\nor that they are regulated by God\u2019s decree and direction.\n([1667] 2002: 417) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nSince all human actions are, according to Spinoza, the product of the\npredetermined order of nature, we can\u2014following the reductive\nstrategy\u2014say that nobody acts except by the will of God.\nSimilarly, since anything that we can achieve is produced by either\nour own actions and/or by external conditions, all such achievements\ncan be understood as the result of divine providence. So, for example,\n(6) is true if (5) is true.</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag2em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(5)</span><span class=\"sen\">Nobody acts except\nby the will of God.</span></li>\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(6)</span><span class=\"sen\">All actions are the\nproduct of the predetermined order of nature.</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nSpinoza also proposes naturalistic reductions of talk about the Holy\nSpirit (1667 [2002, 525]), divine action and providence (1667 [2002,\n445]) and miracles (1667 [2002, 448]).</p>", "<p>\nNaturalistic interpretations of religious language became popular in\nthe 1920s in both Britain and America. For example, Julian Huxley\n(1931) suggests that talk of God could be understood as a way of\ntalking about forces operating in nature or about aspects of nature\nthat we do not understand (see Bowler 2001), and proposes naturalistic\ninterpretations talk of the Holy Ghost and the Son of God (1927:\n37). Influential early figures in the American tradition of\n\u201creligious naturalism\u201d or \u201creligious\nempiricism\u201d are Bernard Meland (1976) and Henry Wieman\n(1932). Wieman offers various naturalistic accounts of talk of God,\nusually identifying God with natural processes that yield or\nfacilitate ethically or socially desirable results.</p>", "<p>\nAlso notable is the work of Gordon Kaufman, a leading figure in the\ndevelopment of modern liberal theology. He observes that in many cases\nthe natural phenomena that are integral to giving our lives meaning\nare deeply mysterious, for instance, that humans are capable of\nconsciousness and thought and the appreciation of beauty. He contends\nthat \u201cGod\u201d is the name given to the \u201cpervasive\nmystery\u2019 that gives life meaning\u201d (2007: 12). Saying that\nGod is \u201creal\u201d or \u201cexists\u201d express the belief\nthat underpinning this \u201cpervasive mystery\u201d are natural\nforces that promote and facilitate ethical, aesthetic and social human\nflourishing (1981: 49).</p>", "<p>\nDoes truth-conditional reductionism offer a plausible theory of\nreligious language? The obvious place to start is whether there are\nany compelling reasons to prefer a reductive rather than a face value\ntheory. Unfortunately, reductionists appear to stumble at this first\nhurdle. It is clear from the writings of reductionists that the\nreductionist interpretation of religious discourse is not advanced\nfrom a consideration of the meanings of what speakers say when they\ntalk about God but instead on the basis of religious or metaphysical\ntheories about the nature of the universe. However, the belief that\nthere is no creator God is not a reason for giving naturalistic\ntruth-conditions to (1); it is a reason for thinking that (1) is\nfalse. Notably, even among writers more sympathetic to linguistic\nreductionism we find lapses into non-linguistic reductionism. For\nexample, while Kaufman sometimes presents his theory as an account of\nwhat is meant by talk about God, at other times he presents a much\nmore clearly revisionary proposal. He writes, \u201cIt is this cosmic\nserendipitous creativity, I suggest, that we <em>should</em> today\nthink of as God\u201d (Kaufman 2007: 26, my italics) and he proposes\nthat the \u201ctraditional notion\u201d of God\u2019s purposive\nactivity in the word should be <em>replaced</em> with </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nwhat I call <em>trajectories</em> or <em>directional movements</em>\nthat emerge spontaneously in the course of evolutionary and historical\ndevelopments.

There remains the further question of what\nspeakers mean when they <em>use</em> religious sentences. The semantic\nor propositional content of a sentence and its truth conditions is one\nthing, the information that a sentence is used to communicate is\nanother. Any philosophical account of religious discourse must allow\nfor non-literal utterances, where the propositional content of the\nutterance and the thought that it is used to communicate appear to\ndiverge. However, according to the face value theory, utterances such\nas (7), (8) and (9) should\u2014unless the context indicates\notherwise\u2014be understood as literal assertions that, if sincerely\nstated by a religious believer, express the speaker\u2019s belief in\nwhat is\n said.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-3\" id=\"ref-3\">3</a>]</sup></p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag2em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(7)</span><span class=\"sen\">God created the\nworld.</span></li>\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(8)</span><span class=\"sen\"> The authors of the\nBible were inspired by the Holy Spirit.</span></li>\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(9)</span><span class=\"sen\">God is\nomnipotent.</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nThere are two main types of opposition to (b*). The first is that\nreligious utterances\u2014including utterances of indicative\nsentences that are apparently literal\u2014are not literal assertions\nbut fall under some other standard category of speech act. Speech\nacts\u2014or <em>illocutionary</em> acts in Austin\u2019s (1955\n[1975, 95]) terminology\u2014are what a speaker does in saying\nsomething. Examples include assertions, questions, commands, warnings,\nthreats, statements of intention, requests. So, according to the first\ntype of opposition to (b*) religious utterances, while many of them\nappear to be literal assertions, are in fact some other kind of speech\nact. Proposals include analogy or metaphor\n (<a href=\"#AnalMeta\">3.1</a>),\n praise or prayer\n (<a href=\"#PraiPray\">3.2</a>),\n and pretence or other kinds of quasi-assertion\n (<a href=\"#Fict\">3.3</a>).\n The second type of opposition to (b*), considered in\n (<a href=\"#ReliPurp\">3.4</a>),\n proposes that religious sentences are used for various\n(non-assertoric) purposes but does not identify a unified speech act\nas characteristic of religious discourse.</p>", "<p>\nThe two main kinds of non-literal discourse that have been seen as\nparticularly important in religion are analogy and\n metaphor.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-4\" id=\"ref-4\">4</a>]</sup>\n Analogy relates to the use of expressions that occur in both\nreligious and non-religious contexts. Take, for example, the\nexpressions \u201cgood\u201d, \u201cwise\u201d and\n\u201cpowerful\u201d when used in ordinary contexts to talk about\npeople. Do these expressions have the same meaning when used to talk\nabout God, or are they used analogously: is the conventional meaning\nthey have when used to talk about mundane objects in some way modified\nwhen used to talk about God? Discussion of religious analogy was\nparticularly lively in early medieval theology and Aquinas was a\nleading proponent of an analogical treatment of religious predicates.\nSee Roger M. White (2010) for a detailed account of Aquinas\u2019\ntheory, its background in Aristotle\u2019s philosophy as well as\nsubsequent ideas about analogy in religion in the work of Karl Barth\nand Immanuel Kant.</p>", "<p>\nA detailed contemporary account of analogy by Richard Swinburne (1993:\nch. 4) proposes that analogical use of a term involves a modification\nof its syntactic and/or semantic rules. A syntactic rule for the use\nof a term <i>p</i> sets down general conditions governing its use. A\nsemantic rule for <i>p</i> gives examples of the things to which\n<i>p</i> correctly applies, or does not correctly apply. For instance,\ngiving a semantic rule for <em>red</em> might involve pointing to\nvarious examples red objects and contrasting them with objects that\nare not red (1993: 58). In using an expression analogically, Swinburne\nproposes, its semantic or syntactic are loosened. So <i>W</i>*, the\nanalogical use of a predicate <i>W</i>, may require a less strict\ndegree of resemblance to standard examples of <i>W</i> for its correct\nuse. Swinburne believes that \u201cperson\u201d which in its\nordinary sense has living human beings with physical bodies as its\nstandard examples, must be used analogically with a suitable weakening\nof its semantic rules and modification of its syntactic rules when\napplied to God.</p>", "<p>\nIt is notable that on Swinburne\u2019s theory analogy can be seen as\na commonplace feature of language use that is both compatible with a\nface value theory and found much more widely than in religious\ndiscourse. For example, consider the following utterances:</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag2em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(10)</span><span class=\"sen\">The lawn is\nsquare.</span></li>\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(11)</span><span class=\"sen\">The audience was\nsilent.</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nLawns do not, of course, have four sides of equal length and in saying\n(11) the speaker does not mean that the audience was not making any\nnoise whatsoever. According to modern pragmatic theories of\ninterpretation (such as Sperber &amp; Wilson 1986; Carston 2002;\nRecanti 2004), constituent expressions or concepts undergo an ad hoc\nmodification prompted by the context in which they are uttered and\nunderstood. For instance, (10) might involve a loosening of the\nconcept SQUARE, i.e., SQUARE* that includes not just objects that are\nsquare but also objects (like lawns) that look square or are\napproximately square. Akin to Swinburne\u2019s account rule\nmodification in analogy, the condition that squares have four sides of\nequal length and internal angles of ninety degrees is relaxed.\nUnderstood in this way, however, analogy is not distinctive of\nreligious discourse but a prevalent characteristic of normal\ncommunication. When God is the subject matter, expressions undergo a\nsuitable ad hoc loosening as part of normal, literal\ncommunication.</p>", "<p>\nRecent research has focused more on religious\n metaphors.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-5\" id=\"ref-5\">5</a>]</sup>\n The importance of metaphor has long been noted by theologians, with\nSally McFague (1983) offering the most extensive treatment, while in\nthe philosophy of religion William Alston (1989: ch. 1 and 2), Janet\nSoskice (1985), Anthony Kenny (2005) and Richard Swinburne (1991: ch.\n3; 1993: ch. 4 and 5)\nhave all contributed to the discussion.</p>", "<p>\nSince metaphors are commonplace in various areas of discourse, it may\nseem that questions about <em>religious</em> metaphor should be\nsubsumed under questions about metaphor in general raised in the\nphilosophy of language. However, some have proposed that what is said\nabout God is <em>irreducibly metaphorical</em>. Tillich\u2019s (1951)\ntheory that religious language is symbolic is perhaps an early\nexpression of the view, and Anthony Kenny and Sally McFague are more\nrecent proponents of a view of this type (see also J\u00fcngel 1974;\nSarot 1992). William Alston, the chief critic of the theory, offers\nthe following statement of irreducibility theory (1989:\n17\u201319):</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag3em\">\n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">(IT)</span><span class=\"sen\">Religious metaphors\nare the only way of stating truths about God, and the content of a\nmetaphorical utterance about God cannot be stated, even in part, in\nliteral terms.</span></li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nAlston sees the supporter of IT as construing even apparently literal\nclaims about God as metaphorical. However, Alston\u2019s formulation\nmay be overly modest, since both Kenny and McFague seem to take the\nview that <em>all</em> talk of God is irreducibly metaphorical,\nirrespective of whether it is true or false.</p>", "<p>\nIT fails, according to Alston, because metaphors, religious metaphors\nin particular, are always in principle susceptible to literal\nparaphrase. Scott (2013: 180\u2013182) argues that IT, on any\nplausible account of what metaphors are, faces insurmountable\nproblems. For example, according to one standard theory (Searle 1993),\nmetaphors say something that is usually patently false with the aim of\nimplying something <em>other</em> than the false thing that is said.\n\u201cGod is my rock\u201d, for instance, might imply that God is a\nsource of confidence for the speaker. However, it follows from IT that\nif a metaphor about God implies anything true about God then that\nimplied claim should also be metaphorical. This appears to undermine\ntruthful communication about God. If, however, talk of God is not in\nthe business of expressing truths, according to what norm are\nutterances about God affirmed or rejected? Metaphor theories therefore\nface challenges in specifying and defending the irreducibility claim\nas well as in as well as elaborating what a metaphor is.</p>", "<p>\nAlthough some caution is needed in placing work in continental\nphilosophy into the analytic classifications that inform this article,\nthe treatment of religious language by Jean-Luc Marion (1994, 1982\n[1995]) and Jacques Derrida (1992) appears sympathetic to the speech act\ntheories considered in this section. Speakers, according to Marion, in\nuttering indicative sentences about God praise God (and thereby\nexpress devotion, awe, and so on, towards God) rather than express\nbeliefs about God. Derrida is critical of Marion; not, however,\nbecause he endorses a face value approach but because he believes\nspeakers are better understood as voicing prayers to God rather than\npraise.</p>", "<p>\nMarion\u2019s theory is influenced by the apophatic idea that God\ncannot be accurately conceived of. Conceiving of something, according\nto Marion, involves placing some descriptive limitation or restriction\non that thing. God and other religious subjects, Marion claims, are\n\u201csaturated phenomena\u201d that cannot be captured by human\nconcepts: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThat he is the given par excellence implies that \u201cGod\u201d is\ngiven without restriction, without reserve, without restraint.\n\u201cGod\u201d is given not at all partially, following this or\nthat outline \u2026 but absolutely, without the reserve of any\noutline, with every side open \u2026 (1994: 588) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nHowever, inspired by Dionysius\u2019 writings, he presents an\ninterpretation of religious discourse as referring to God without\nascribing properties to God. For example, \u201cGod is good\u201d\naddresses rather than describes God (1982 [1995, 76]). Marion calls\nthis non-objectifying and non-predicative way of talking about God\n\u201cpraise\u201d; it is a form of speech that is laudatory but\ncombined with a recognition (at least by the speaker) that the\nproperty that is apparently predicated of God is inappropriate. Praise\n\u201cfeeds on the impossibility or, better, the impropriety of the\ncategory\u201d (1982 [1995, 76]). In talking of God, therefore,\nspeakers praise God but recognise the inadequacy of the concepts they\nare using to represent God: the predicate expressions are not used\nwith the belief that they accurately represent God. In saying\n\u201cGod is good\u201d speakers do not, therefore, believe or\nassert that <em>God is good</em>. For further discussion see James\nSmith 2002.</p>", "<p>\nDerrida is sympathetic to Marion\u2019s account but raises the\nobjection that praising God (the \u201cencomium\u201d of God), on\nMarion\u2019s account, still involves predication: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nEven if it is not a predicative affirmation of the current type, the\nencomium preserves the style and the structure of a predicative\naffirmation.

Unlike praise, prayer is a\nform of address that, Derrida argues, is entirely non-descriptive.\nPrayer \u201cis not predicative, theoretical (theo<em>logical</em>),\nor constative\u201d (1992: 110). He elaborates:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nI will hold to one other distinction: prayer in itself, one may say,\nimplies nothing other than the supplicating address to the other,\nperhaps beyond all supplication and giving, to give the promise of His\npresence as other, and finally the transcendence of His otherness\nitself, even without any other determination; the encomium, although\nit is not a simple attributive speech, nevertheless preserves an\nirreducible relationship to the attribution.

For\nexample, Marion claims in praising God the predicates that are\nascribed to God are recognised as inadequate by <em>speakers</em>.\nThis seems implausible. Speakers in many cases appear to believe what\nthey are saying about God. Marion might argue that such religious\nbelievers have <em>false</em> beliefs about God\u2019s nature, but to\nclaim that they do not have beliefs about God\u2019s nature that they\nintend to communicate seems to be a misrepresentation of\nspeakers\u2019 states of mind. Moreover, Derrida\u2019s own\nsuggestion that talk of God should be understood as prayer does not\nseem to have any advantage over the position his is criticising.\nPrayer also involves utterances that appear to represent God:\n\u201cOur Father, which art in heaven\u201d, for instance.</p>", "<p>\nFictionalists defend the moral and intellectual legitimacy of engaging\nwith a field of discourse for speakers that do not believe that the\nsentences of that discourse are true (for a general overview see\nDivers &amp; Liggins 2005, for a review focused on religious\nfictionalism see Scott &amp; Malcolm, forthcoming). Some fictionalists\npropose that that speakers employ <em>quasi-assertion</em>. A\nquasi-assertion is a speech act that has the appearance of an\nassertion\u2014it is the utterance of an indicative\nsentence\u2014but it does not commit the speaker to the truth of the\nexpressed proposition. The speaker goes along with or <em>accepts</em>\nthe content of what is quasi-asserted but does not thereby believe it.\nThe details of quasi-assertion depend on the kind of fictionalism\nbeing proposed and a variety of options have been proposed (for an\noverview see Kalderon 2005: 119\u2013129). On some accounts,\nquasi-assertion involves the assertion of something other than the\npropositional content of the uttered sentence. For example, a\nfictionalist about mathematics might argue that a mathematical\nsentence M is used to assert that M is true <em>according to standard\nmathematics</em> (Field 1980). Alternatively, to quasi-assert a sentence might be to\n<em>pretend</em> to assert it. Comparable approaches are found among\nreligious fictionalist. Peter Lipton (2007), for instance, suggests\nthat engagement with religious could be akin to immersion in a\nfiction; the fictionalist accordingly pretends that the claims of\nreligion are true. Other religious fictionalists (such as Robin Le\nPoidevin 2016) propose that the fictionalist, without believing that a\nreligious utterance is true, may say it on the basis that it is true\nwithin some religious tradition.</p>", "<p>\nParticularly important for our purposes is the distinction between\nrevolutionary and hermeneutic fictionalism. Revolutionary religious\nfictionalism is not a theory of religious language\u2014it is not a\nposition on what speakers actually mean\u2014but instead a\nrevisionary proposal that is usually offered in response to error\ntheory about religion. Despite religious claims being untrue,\nrevolutionary fictionalists argue religious discourse has sufficient\npragmatic benefits that we should continue to employ religious\nlanguage and engage in religious thought rather than eliminate it,\neven though we should not believe that it is true. In general,\nrevolutionary fictionalism is motivated by the wish to continue to\nreceive the social and other benefits of engagement with a religion\nwithout commitment to its truth. LePoidevin and Lipton are both\nrevolutionary fictionalists. The Sea of Faith Network, inspired by the\nwork of Don Cupitt (1980), can also be understood as sympathetic to\nrevolutionary fictionalism because it promotes Christian practice and\nthe continuing engagement with religious discourse without religious\nbelief. Interesting though they are, we will not be investigating these\ntheories further because they are not saying anything about the\nmeaning of religious utterances. Instead, they recommending a change\nof attitude towards the claim of religion and quasi-assert rather than\nassert them.</p>", "<p>\nHermeneutic fictionalism about religion is the view that speakers are\nnot committed to the truth of what they say on religious matters:\nspeakers are quasi-asserting rather than asserting indicative\nreligious sentences. This is not offered as a proposal about what\nspeakers should do but instead as a fact about current linguistic\npractice. Speakers accept but do not believe what they say when\nengaging in religious discourse. So, along with other positions\ndiscussed in this section, hermeneutic fictionalists reject (b*).\nDefending this position may seem like a tall order: isn\u2019t\nhermeneutic fictionalism undermined by the apparent linguistic\nevidence that religious speakers are committed to the truth of what\nthey say? Nevertheless, there are a couple of positions that look to\nbe potential contenders for religious hermeneutic fictionalism.</p>", "<p>\nFirst, Georges Rey has defended a position that he calls\n<em>meta-atheism</em> according to which practitioners of religion\nexhibit widespread self-deception about what they say (2006: 337). For\nanyone with a basic education in science, Rey contends, it is obvious\nthat religious claims are false. Rey is not proposing, however, that\neducated speakers are insincere when they affirm religious claims\nsince they may think of themselves as believing what they are saying\n(2006: 338). Instead, speakers are in a state of self-deception. While\nthey may recognise on a more critical level that religious claims are\nfalse, they do not entertain this when engaging in religious\ndiscourse. Why do religious people do not recognise and consciously\ndraw out the implications of their disbelief? Rey suggests a number of\nreasons: loyalty to family and other social groups, personal ties and\nidentifications with religious institutions, resistance to changing\none\u2019s public stance, the wish for one\u2019s life to be part of\na larger project. Rey supplements his arguments by pointing up\ndifferences between religious and scientific judgements aimed at\nshowing that the latter are \u201cunderstood to be fictional from the\nstart\u201d (2006: 345). Now, Rey\u2019s position is, to say the\nleast, contentious\u2014for starters, his contention that religious\nclaims are obviously false seems unsupportable (see Scott 2015 for a\nmore detailed critique). However, with some assumptions about\nself-deception, we can understand meta-atheism as a kind of\nhermeneutic religious fictionalism. Speakers are in a conflicted state\nof self-deception that falls short of belief: on some level or in some\nuncritical contexts speakers treat religious claims as if they were\ntrue, while also believing in critical and reflective contexts that\nthey are false. Accordingly, in uttering religious sentences speakers\nengage in quasi-assertion whereby they accept what is said without\ngenuinely believing it to be true.</p>", "<p>\nSecond, a point of debate in current research on the nature of faith\nis whether propositional faith\u2014i.e., faith that\n<i>p</i>\u2014requires belief that <i>p</i>. Supporters of\ntraditional doxastic accounts defend this condition while supporters\nof non-doxastic theories of faith argue that it is sufficient that one\nhave a positive cognitive attitude towards <i>p</i> other than belief.\nVarious proposal for what this non-doxastic attitude is. Candidates\ninclude: acceptance (Alston 2007), assent (Schellenberg 2005),\nassumption (Swinburne 2005; Howard-Snyder 2013), trust (Audi 2011),\nhope (McKaughan 2013; Pojman 1986 and 2001), or acquiescence (Buchak\n2012). However, to the extent that religious discourse is in the\nbusiness of trading in the expression of faithful attitudes then it\nfollows from the non-doxastic position that a speaker may sincerely\naffirm their faith in a religious proposition without believing it to\nbe true. Notably, some non-doxastic theorists offer linguistic\nevidence to show that speakers to not believe what they say. This\nappears to concede a hermeneutic fictionalist account of faithful\ndiscourse (for discussion see Malcolm &amp; Scott 2016). It seems likely that many\nproponents of non-doxastic theories of faith will not welcome the\ncharacterisation of their position as a variety of hermeneutic\nfictionalism (see Howard-Snyder 2016 and F. Malcolm forthcoming).\nHowever, non-doxastic theories are usually presented primarily as\npsychological or epistemological theories about the nature of faith;\nthe implications of the position for religious discourse, and its\nrelationship with hermeneutic fictionalism, have yet to be fully set\nout.</p>", "<p>\nWe have been looking at theories than characterise the affirmation of\nindicative religious sentences by a type of speech act other than\nliteral assertion. However, some accounts propose that religious\ndiscourse, rather than exhibiting a distinctive type of speech act,\nemploys language for certain distinctive purposes. Possible examples\nof this position include Wittgenstein\u2019s suggestion that a\nreligious judgement should be understood as a picture that has a\nregulative function in guiding practical decisions (1966: 53\u20134)\nand Kant\u2019s proposal that religious utterances communicate\nguidance for how to think (<em>Critique of Pure Reason</em> A671/B699;\nA686/B714). This section will consider the accounts from Ian Ramsey\n(1957) and more recently Rowan Williams (2014).</p>", "<p>\nAccording to Ramsey, full-blooded religious engagement involves two\nthings: a commitment and a discernment. The commitment is an attitude\nthat is directed towards the universe as a whole; it is\n\u201ctotal\u201d and has a particular intensity akin to a personal\nrelationship. The discernment involves a \u201cdisclosure\u201d,\nwhich he describes as a recognition of something of enormous\nimportance. The something in question is not a new fact but a\nrecognition that \u201cbrings together\u201d what is known whereby\none appreciates the world in a new light. For Ramsey, the purpose of\nreligious language is to communicate and promote religious commitment\nand discernment: \u201creligious language talks of the discernment\nwith which is associated, by way of response, a total\ncommitment\u201d (1957: 49). With respect to utterances about God,\nRamsey says: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nMy suggestion is that we understand their logical behaviour aright if\nwe see them as primarily evocative of what we have called the odd\ndiscernment, that characteristically religious situation which, if\nevoked, provokes a total commitment. (1957: 50)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nWhen it comes to the details of how to interpret specific religious\nutterances, Ramsey\u2019s proposals are very varied. Some utterances\nhe takes to be expressive of attitudes. Talk of \u201ceternal\npurpose\u201d aims to evoke a sense of \u201ccosmic wonder\u201d\n(1957: 77). Some are metalinguistic claims about the proper use of\nreligious discourse: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nto say that \u201cGod is impassable\u201d is to claim that the word\n\u201cGod\u201d is a word which cannot be confined to passability\nlanguage. (1957: 89) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nOthers are about mystery: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nLet us recognize that the doctrine of the Virgin Birth is essentially\na claim for mystery at Christ\u2019s birth or at Christ\u2019s\ndeath. (1957: 132) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nHowever, for Ramsey, religious sentences have representational content\nbut are used by speakers in a variety of non-representational\nways\u2014expressive, metalinguistic, to generate a sense of\nmystery\u2014for the purposes of evoking discernment and encouraging\ncommitment, rather than descriptively.</p>", "<p>\nRecently Rowan Williams (2014) has proposed that religious language\nserves to challenge us both morally, by undermining selfishness and\ncomplacency, as well as conceptually by encouraging us to think about\nthe world in different terms. The use of religious language involves\ninnovations that \u201cinvite us to rethink our metaphysical\nprinciples\u201d (2014: 130), undercut \u201cour sense of being a\nfinished subject with a clear agenda of need and desire\u201d (2014:\n152\u20133), and \u201copen us to a truth that is changing us and\nnever leaves us in complacent possession of the power we think we\nhave\u201d (2014: 154). A similar approach is taken to discourse\nabout God. What we are representing in talking of God is not an object\nbut \u201ca particular aspect of every perception, the aspect that\ngives to any specific perception its provisionality, its openness to\nbeing represented afresh\u201d (2014: 148). These purposes can be\nfurthered even by using religious sentences that are not\nconsistent.</p>", "<p>\nFace value theorists will, of course, find much to object to in both\nRamsey\u2019s and Williams\u2019 discussions of religious language.\nOne obvious point to raise is that if engagement in religious\ndiscourse is driven by the purposes that Ramsey and Williams describe\nthen it seems that one need not be concerned with the truth of what\none says. Notably, Williams appears to by sympathetic to the\nendorsement of incoherent claims if they further the broader proposed\npurposes of religious discourse. However, caution is needed in\nclassifying these accounts as descriptive of religious discourse\nrather than revisionary proposals for objectives that speakers might\naim for. If they fall into the latter category, then they are in a\nsimilar position to revolutionary fictionalism.</p>", "<p>\nMinimalist accounts of religious language, which are\u2014rightly or\nwrongly\u2014closely associated with Wittgenstein, agree with (a*)\nand (b*) but take issue with the face value understanding of\ndescriptiveness along with associated ideas of fact, representation,\nreference and truth. For convenience, let us call these\n<em>realism-relevant</em> concepts. The opposition involves two main\nideas. First, rather than posit a demanding standard that a field of\ndiscourse must meet to count as genuinely descriptive, minimalists\npropose that a discourse that satisfies very modest\nconditions\u2014for example, that it possesses a truth predicate and\nstandards of justification for what is affirmed or rejected\u2014is\nthereby descriptive. Second, realism-relevant concepts are taken to be\nat least partly constituted by features of the discourse (or\n\u201clanguage game\u201d) in which they are used. Minimalists\nthereby reject a uniform account of descriptiveness across different\nareas of discourse. Descriptiveness, reference, truth, and so on are\n<em>language-game-internal</em> concepts: they are constituted\ndifferently in different areas of discourse.\n <a href=\"#MiniAbouReli\">4.1</a>\n will consider minimalist accounts of religious discourse and\n <a href=\"#Witt\">4.2</a>\n will look at whether Wittgenstein might plausibly be understood as\nsharing this approach.</p>", "<p>\nThe discussion in this section touches on issues that have been\nexplored in detail outside of the philosophy of religion. For more on\nthe wider philosophical background see Stoljar &amp; Damnjanovic 2014\non deflationary and Pedersen &amp; Wright 2013 and 2016 on pluralist\naccounts of truth.</p>", "<p>\nThe two key features of minimalism are prominent in Hilary\nPutnam\u2019s Wittgensteinian account of religious language in\n<em>Renewing Philosophy</em> (1992). First, Putnam draws attention to\nWittgenstein\u2019s well-known remarks on family resemblances (1953:\n65\u201366). Wittgenstein\u2019s target in these remarks is the idea\nthat an expression requires necessary and sufficient conditions for\nits correct application. Intuitively, it seems that there must be such\nconditions if the meaning of the expression remains the same when it\nis used in different contexts. However, consider the term\n\u201cgame\u201d, with its varying applications\u2014board games,\ncard games, Olympic games, and so on; we can see, Putnam (following\nWittgenstein) argues, that for any particular condition that appears\nto characterise some types of game, there will be others that fail to\nsatisfy it. Rather than common necessary and sufficient condition for\nall uses of \u201cgame\u201d, there is a network of similarities and\nrelationships between them. Putnam proposes that Wittgenstein took a\nsimilar lesson to apply to notions like <em>language</em>,\n<em>reference</em> and <em>truth</em>: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nreferring uses don\u2019t have an \u201cessence\u201d; there\nisn\u2019t some one thing which can be called referring. There are\noverlapping similarities between one sort of referring and the next,\nthat is all. (1992: 167\u20138) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nPhilosophical confusion results when, for instance, we attempt to\napply standards of reference appropriate to descriptions of the\nperceived world to mathematical claims. Putnam then extends this point\nto religion: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe use of religious language is both like and unlike ordinary cases\nof reference: but to ask whether it is \u201creally\u201d reference\nor \u201cnot really\u201d reference is to be in a muddle. There is\nno essence of reference \u2026 In short, Wittgenstein is telling you\nwhat <em>isn\u2019t</em> the way to understand religious language.\nThe way to understand religious language isn\u2019t to try to apply\nsome metaphysical classification of possible forms of discourse.\n(1992: 168) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nA similar point is taken to extend to truth, descriptiveness and other\nrealism-relevant concepts.</p>", "<p>\nSecond, Putnam argues that truth can be understood as idealised\nrational\n acceptability.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-6\" id=\"ref-6\">6</a>]</sup>\n This is not to say that truth depends on justification <em>here and\nnow</em>\u2014that is, what seems to us justified on currently\navailable evidence\u2014but rather that truth is not independent of\nall justification: \u201cTo claim a statement is true is to claim it\ncould be justified\u201d (1981: 56). To be truth-apt, it is sufficient that the assertoric\nutterances of religious discourse are governed by internal standards\nof warrant. While the standards of warrant in a given area of\nreligious discourse may be significantly different to those in science\n(appealing to the authority of the Bible or the Pope, for instance,\nwould not count in favour of a scientific theory), the condition that\nthere are such standards is clearly satisfied. To arrive at a positive\naccount of what constitutes truth (and other realism-relevant\nconcepts) in <em>religion</em>, therefore, requires and examination of\nthe specific standards of justification that are in play in religious\ndiscourse (or, more accurately, the different standards in different\nreligious discourses).</p>", "<p>\nD.Z. Phillips was a leading interpreter and champion of a\nWittgensteinian approach to philosophy of religion. His early writings\nappear sympathetic to a non-cognitivist account of religious\ndiscourse. He questions whether religious utterances are descriptive\nand proposes, for instance, that \u201creligious belief is itself the\nexpression of a moral vision\u201d (1976: 143) and that </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nthe praising and the glorifying does not refer to some object called\nGod. Rather, the expression of such praise and glory is what we call\nthe worship of God. (1976: 149) </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nIn his later writings from the 1990s, however, Phillips\u2019 remarks\nappear more minimalist.</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nBy all means say that \u201cGod\u201d functions as a referring\nexpression, that \u201cGod\u201d refers to a sort of object, that\nGod\u2019s reality is a matter of fact, and so on. <em>But please\nremember that, as yet, no conceptual or grammatical clarification has\ntaken place</em>. We have all the work still to do since we shall now\nhave to show, in this religious context, what speaking of\n\u201creference\u201d, \u201cobject\u201d,\n\u201cexistence\u201d, and so on amounts to, how it differs, in\nobvious ways, from other uses of these terms. (1995: 138)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nHere, Phillips allows that religious expressions refer and religious\nsentences are descriptive, etc., but proposes\u2014in line with\nminimalism\u2014that the reference and descriptiveness of religious\ndiscourse is partly constituted by features distinctive of religious\ndiscourse. For a detailed and sympathetic treatment of Phillips\u2019\nwork see Burley 2012 and for a critique see Scott &amp; Moore\n1997.</p>", "<p>\nIn general, religious minimalists agree on a number of points. They\ngrant that religious statements have propositional content, and may be\ntrue, descriptive, factual, and so on. Second, realism-relevant\nconcepts are understood as <em>language game internal</em> concepts.\nTo know what makes for truth in religion, for instance, we need to\nlook at the internal standards of justification that inform religious\ndiscourse. Third, the primary aim of minimalism, at least in the\nWittgensteinian form it takes in philosophy of religion, is to\nelucidate the different standards that characterise different areas of\ndiscourse, and to spell out the differences between realism-relevant\nconcepts in religion and realism-relevant concepts in science or\nhistory. However, there is also an important area of disagreement\nbetween religious minimalists. Phillips takes the different\nconstitution of truth in different areas discourse to show that\n\u201ctrue\u201d <em>means</em> something different in different\ndiscourses: We have multiple truth concepts, with different extensions\n(1976: 142; 1995: 149). In contrast, Putnam appears to be more\nsympathetic to a <em>pluralist</em> account of truth: the truth\npredicate has certain necessary and sufficient conditions for its use\n(such as the disquotational schema) but may be additionally\nconstituted by different further conditions according to whether we\nare talking about religious truths, scientific truths, or ethical\ntruths (see Wright 1992: ch. 2). Fragmentary accounts of truth of the\nkind that Phillips appears to endorse have been widely\ncriticised\u2014see, for example, Timothy Williamson (1994: 141)\nChristine Tappolet (1997).</p>", "<p>\nReligious minimalism is usually offered as a program of research\nrather than a detailed account of religious discourse. There is talk\nof the need to attend to the practices and forms of life of religious\nbelievers, an emphasis on the difference between religious and other\nareas of discourse, and warnings against applying scientific or\nhistorical standards to religious judgements, but the positive story\nof the meaning of religious utterances is often left as a promissory\nnote. However, there are some areas where more substantial points of\ndisagreement can be pursued. For instance, many supporters of the face\nvalue theory will reject the pluralist or fragmentary accounts of\ntruth that inform the minimalist approach. Also, even if one is\nsympathetic to a pluralist account of truth, it does not\nstraightforwardly follow that truth in religion is different from\ntruth in science or history (for a defense of this point see Scott\n2013: ch. 11). Religious minimalism will also be rejected by\nnon-cognitivists. If the descriptiveness of religious language is\nsecured as easily as minimalists propose, then this will undermine the\nnon-cognitivist position that it is\u2014despite superficial\nappearances\u2014not descriptive. Non-cognitivists argue that the\n\u201cpropositional surface\u201d of language conceals a variety of\ndifferent functions: ethical statements express approval or\ndisapproval, mathematical statements are stipulations, and so on. For\na defense of this see Blackburn 1998.</p>", "<p>\nWittgenstein\u2019s work on religion has served as a sourcebook for\nmodern opposition to the face value theory. His remarks have been seen\nas lending support to many of the positions considered in this\narticle. Non-cognitivists can find support in Wittgenstein\u2019s\ncharacterisation of religion as \u201ca passionate commitment to a\nsystem of reference\u201d (1970 [1994, 64]; see also Tilghman 1991);\nfictionalists in his proposal that religious believers live their\nlives according to certain \u201cpictures\u201d; non-assertoric\nspeech act theorists in his comparison of religious utterances to\ncommands (1970 [1994, 61]). Wittgenstein was even attracted (if only\nbriefly) to a subjectivist interpretation of God-talk ([PO]:\n42). Given Wittgenstein writings on religion are only infrequent and\nrelatively brief, it is perhaps not surprising that, beyond his clear\nresistance to the face value theory, he would not have settled views\non the topic. For accounts profoundly influenced by or interpretative\nof Wittgenstein, see Winch (1987), N. Malcom (1997), Rhees (1970).</p>", "<p>\nThe minimalist reading of Wittgenstein is supported by his apparent\nendorsements of a deflationary account of truth (1953: 136), although\nhe does not explicitly endorse the idealised justification theory that\nPutnam proposes. However, the best evidence for minimalism comes from\nhis emphasis on the differences between the use of religious\nsentences, and historical or scientific (and in general empirical and\ndescriptive) sentences. Specifically, he points up differences between\nthe standards of warrant employed in religious and other\ndiscourses\u2014the kinds of circumstance in which a religious\nbeliever judges something to be true, grounds for disagreements\nbetween religious believers and non-believers, and so on. This\npervades his work on religion. For example, Wittgenstein compares the\nreligious belief in the Last Judgement with scientifically based\nbeliefs, or ordinary beliefs about observable states of affairs (he\ngives the example \u201cThere is a German aeroplane overhead\u201d).\nWhile religious believers may speak of \u201cevidence\u201d and\n\u201chistorical events\u201d, Wittgenstein argues that the evidence\nand events cited in connection with religious judgements do not\nconstitutes reasons to believe them in the way that evidence given in\nsupport of a hypothesis gives a reason to believe that the hypothesis\nis true. In religious discourse \u201creasons look entirely different\nfrom normal reasons\u201d (1966: 56), religious belief is not\n\u201ca matter of reasonability\u201d (1966: 58), religious beliefs\nare not hypotheses or opinions, they are not properly spoken of as\nobjects of knowledge or as having a high probability, and when\nhistorical facts are introduced in support of religious belief\n\u201cthey are not treated as historical, empirical,\npropositions\u201d (1966: 57). Here Wittgenstein seems at pains to\nemphasise the contrast between religious discourse and empirical\ndiscourses. Indeed, he implies that when taken (or where offered) as\nreporting scientific facts or scientific theories, religious sentences\nare in error. Wittgenstein is not, according to the minimalist\ninterpretation, seeking to find any disadvantageous comparison between\nreligion and science; to show, for example, that religion is merely\nexpressive of attitudes, while science is properly descriptive.\nRather, he is describing the different standards that make for truth\nand descriptiveness in these fields of discourse and, in so doing,\nelucidating the distinctive characteristics of religious\n<em>truth</em> as well as other realism-relevant concepts.</p>", "<p>\nNotably, if Wittgenstein was a minimalist about religious discourse\nthen one standard line of objection to his account is misplaced.\nWittgenstein is sometimes criticised as proposing that religious\ndiscourse should be quarantined from other areas of discourse, in\nparticular science and history. This is seen as leading to a variety\nof fideism, where religious beliefs are compartmentalised and\nunsusceptible to non-religious intellectual evaluation. The objection\nis forcefully prosecuted by Kai Nielsen. According to Wittgenstein,\nNielsen argues, </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nno philosophical or other kind of reasonable criticism, or for that\nmatter defence, is possible for forms of life or, indeed, of any form\nof life, including Hinduism, Christianity and the like. (2000: 147)\n</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nHowever, contrasting the different standards exhibited by religious\nand scientific discourses is consistent with scientifically or\nhistorically well-founded evidence informing religious judgement.\nIndeed, minimalists would be remiss in not taking account of the fact\nthat historical evidence clearly <em>is</em> seriously weighed in a\nvariety of religious beliefs including belief in Christ\u2019s\nresurrection, or the creation of the world, and beliefs about miracle\nworkers and what they have done. Insofar as this happens, the verdicts\nof historical or scientific investigation can modify religious\njudgements. In a similar way, many religious judgements are dependent\non historically or scientifically assessable evidence. For example,\ncompelling evidence that the documentary and eyewitness testimony for\na miracle was a hoax would be a good reason not to believe that the\nmiracle in question occurred and this evidence comes from\n\u201coutside\u201d the religious language game. However,\nminimalists can allow that empirical evidence is part of the\njustification for many religious beliefs while maintaining the theory\nthat religious discourse employs distinct standards of justification\nto science.</p>", "<p>\nAlthough they have received less attention that the other topics in\nthis article, two other issues relating to religious language should\nbe noted. First, the reference of \u201cGod\u201d, second, the logic\nof religious language.</p>", "<p>\nRecent work on the reference of \u201cGod\u201d mostly proceeds from\nthe assumption that \u201cGod\u201d is a name rather than a title or\na description (for criticism of this view see Johnston 2011:\n6\u20137; for supporting arguments see Scott 2013: 86\u20137). From\nthis starting point, attention has focused on how to apply the rich\nresources of research on names from the philosophy of language to this\ncase. For example, according to descriptivist theories\n\u201cGod\u201d has a descriptive content (a view that stretches\nback at least as far as Anselm), whereas according to Millian theories\n\u201cGod\u201d refers to its bearer without conveying any\ninformation about the object referred to. The latter theory can be\ncombined with a causal theory of reference (Kripke 1980) to explain\nhow the name becomes attached to the referent. Although many of the\narguments in this debate derive from the philosophy of language, there\nare also interesting implications of these positions for the\nphilosophy of religion. For instance, a descriptivist theory appears\nto place limits on how wrong we can be about what God is like. A\ncausal theory of reference, in contrast, will need to be backed up by\na defence of the possibility of causal interaction with God and an\naccount of how God is named. For discussion of these theories see\nAlston 1989 and 1991, Gellman 1997 and Sullivan 2012. For a recent review of the\nfield see Scott 2013: ch. 7.</p>", "<p>\nDoes religious language adhere to a non-classical logic? This issue\nhas been raised in at least two contexts. First, some of the writings\nof authors in the apophatic tradition have been seen supporting a\nparaconsistent logic of religious language, specifically dialetheism,\nthe view some contradictory sentences are true (see Priest 2002:\n22\u20133, although Scott &amp; Citron 2016: 72 cast doubt on this as\na plausible interpretation of apophatic authors). Second, Michael\nDummett considers a number of arguments in favour of the view the\ndivine omniscience entails bivalence, i.e., that for any statement\n<i>p</i> it is determinately either true or false. For example, if God\nknows that <i>p</i>, then He knows that he knows that <i>p</i> and\ntherefore it is true; but if God does not know <i>p</i> then He knows\nthat He does not know it and hence knows that it is not true. From\nthis it can be shown that God must know whether <i>p</i> is true or\nfalse, thereby securing bivalence (2004: 94\u201396; see also 1991:\n318\u20139, 348\u2013351). Since, for Dummett, realism for a field\nof discourse hinges on the success of the principle of bivalence for\nthe statements of that discourse, it would follow that theism leads to\nglobal realism.

{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/certainty/", "title": "Certainty", "text": ["<p>\n\nThere are various kinds of certainty. A belief is\n<em>psychologically</em> certain when the subject who has it is\nsupremely convinced of its truth. Certainty in this sense is\nsimilar to <em>incorrigibility</em>, which is the property a belief has\nof being such that the subject is incapable of giving it up. But\npsychological certainty is not the same thing as incorrigibility.\nA belief can be certain in this sense without being incorrigible; this\nmay happen, for example, when the subject receives a very compelling\nbit of counterevidence to the (previously) certain belief and gives it\nup for that reason. Moreover, a belief can be incorrigible\nwithout being psychologically certain. For example, a mother may\nbe incapable of giving up the belief that her son did not commit a\ngruesome murder, and yet, compatible with that inextinguishable belief,\nshe may be tortured by doubt.</p>", "<p>\n\nA second kind of certainty is <em>epistemic</em>. Roughly\ncharacterized, a belief is certain in this sense when it has the\nhighest possible epistemic status. Epistemic certainty is often\naccompanied by psychological certainty, but it need not be. It is\npossible that a subject may have a belief that enjoys the highest\npossible epistemic status and yet be unaware that it does. (More\ngenerally, a subject's being certain that <em>p</em> does not\nentail that she is certain that she is certain that <em>p</em>; on this\npoint, see Van Cleve 1979, and see Alston 1980 on level confusions in\nepistemology.) In such a case, the subject may feel less than the\nfull confidence that her epistemic position warrants. I will say\nmore below about the analysis of epistemic certainty and its relation\nto psychological certainty.</p>", "<p>\n\nSome philosophers also make use of the notion of <em>moral</em>\ncertainty (see Markie 1986). For example, in the Latin version of\nPart IV of the <em>Principles of Philosophy</em>, Descartes says that\n\u201csome things are considered as morally certain, that is, as\nhaving sufficient certainty for application to ordinary life, even\nthough they may be uncertain in relation to the absolute power of\nGod\u201d (PW 1, pp. 289-90). Thus characterized, moral\ncertainty appears to be epistemic in nature, though it is a lesser\nstatus than epistemic certainty. In the French version of this\npassage, however, Descartes says that \u201cmoral certainty is\ncertainty which is sufficient to regulate our behaviour, or which\nmeasures up to the certainty we have on matters relating to the conduct\nof life which we never normally doubt, though we know that it is\npossible, absolutely speaking, that they may be false\u201d (PW 1, p.\n289 n. 2). Understood in this way, it does not appear to be a\nspecies of knowledge, given that a belief can be morally certain and\nyet false (contra Markie 1986, p. 36). Rather, on this view, for\na belief to be morally certain is for it to be subjectively rational to\na high degree.</p>", "<p>\n\nAlthough all three kinds of certainty are philosophically\ninteresting, it is epistemic certainty that has traditionally been of\ncentral importance. In what follows, then, I shall focus mainly\non this kind of certainty.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere have been many different conceptions of certainty. Each\nof them captures some central part of our intuitive understanding of\ncertainty, but, as we shall see, none of them is free from\nproblems.</p>", "<p>\n\nCertainty is often explicated in terms of\n<em>indubitability</em>. This has been done in a variety of\nways. One prominent account of certainty is suggested by\nDescartes's presentation of his famous Archimedean point, the\n<em>cogito</em> (I am thinking, therefore I exist). In the Second\nMeditation, Descartes reviews the extensive doubts of the First\nMeditation before saying that even if \u201cthere is a deceiver of\nsupreme power and cunning who is deliberately and constantly deceiving\nme,\u201d still \u201che will never bring it about that I am nothing\nso long as I am something\u201d (PW 2, p. 17). Descartes then\nconcludes that the proposition that he himself exists is true whenever\nhe considers it. It is often thought that the <em>cogito</em> has\na unique epistemic status in virtue of its ability to resist even the\n\u201chyperbolic\u201d doubts raised in the First Meditation (see\nMarkie 1992 and Broughton 2002). However, even if Descartes took\nthis view of the certainty of the <em>cogito</em>, he did not accept\nthe general claim that certainty is grounded in indubitability.\nIn the Third Meditation, Descartes says that he is certain that he is a\nthinking thing, and he explains the certainty of this \u201cfirst item\nof knowledge\u201d (it is unclear whether he regards it as distinct\nfrom the <em>cogito</em>) as resulting from the fact that it is a clear\nand distinct perception (PW 2, p. 24). (Matters are complicated,\nhowever, by the fact that Descartes also says in the Third Meditation\nthat certainty depends on knowing that God exists and is not a\ndeceiver.)</p>", "<p>\n\nLudwig Wittgenstein also seems to connect certainty with\nindubitability. He says that \u201cIf you tried to doubt\neverything you would not get as far as doubting anything. The\ngame of doubting itself presupposes certainty\u201d (1969,\n\u00a7115). What makes possible doubting is \u201cthe fact that\nsome propositions are exempt from doubt, are as it were like hinges on\nwhich those turn\u201d (1969, \u00a7341). Although\nWittgenstein's view is sometimes taken to be\u2014or to provide\nthe basis for\u2014an epistemically satisfying response to skepticism\n(see, e.g., Wright 2003 and 2004), it is hard to see the kind of\ncertainty he has characterized as being epistemic, rather than merely\npsychological, in nature (on this point, see Pritchard 2005).\nThus, when Wittgenstein says, \u201cThe difficulty is to realize the\ngroundlessness of our believing\u201d (1969, \u00a7166) it seems clear\nthat the so-called hinge propositions are ones that we are\npsychologically incapable of calling into question. This is, of\ncourse, compatible with their being false.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn general, every indubitability account of certainty will face a\nsimilar problem. The problem may be posed as a dilemma: when the\nsubject finds herself incapable of doubting one of her beliefs, either\nshe has good reasons for being incapable of doubting it, or she does\nnot. If she does not have good reasons for being unable to doubt\nthe belief, the type of certainty in question can be only\npsychological, not epistemic, in nature. On the other hand, if\nthe subject does have good reasons for being unable to doubt the\nbelief, the belief may be epistemically certain. But, in this\ncase, what grounds the certainty of the belief will be the\nsubject's reasons for holding it, and not the fact that the\nbelief is indubitable.</p>", "<p>\n\nA second problem for indubitability accounts of certainty is that,\nin one sense, even beliefs that are epistemically certain can be\nreasonably doubted. I shall say more about this in \u00a73\nbelow.</p>", "<p>\n\nAccording to a second conception, a subject's belief is\ncertain just in case it <em>could not have been\nmistaken</em>\u2014i.e., false (see, e.g., Lewis 1929).\nAlternatively, the subject's belief is certain when it is\n<em>guaranteed to be true</em>. This is what Roderick Firth calls\nthe \u201ctruth-evaluating\u201d sense of certainty (1967, pp.\n7-8). As with knowing that <em>p</em>, being certain that\n<em>p</em> entails that it is true that <em>p</em>. Certainty is,\nhowever, significantly stronger than lesser forms of knowledge.\nIn cases where the subject knows without being certain that <em>p</em>,\nit is actually true that <em>p</em>, though it could have been\nfalse. But, where the subject is certain that <em>p</em>, it does\nnot merely turn out to be true that <em>p</em>\u2014in some sense it\ncould not have been otherwise.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe difficulty for this conception of certainty is specifying the\nprecise sense in which the belief could not have been false. What\nis meant cannot be what is called metaphysical or broadly logical\nimpossibility. Although some of the paradigmatically certain\nbeliefs are necessarily true in this sense, many others are not.\nFor example, though I am certain of the truth of the <em>cogito</em>,\nit is not necessarily true (in the metaphysical sense) that I\nexist. That is, it is possible that I might not have\nexisted. We might attempt to solve this difficulty by saying that\nthe belief is guaranteed to be true by the subject's grounds for\nit (see, e.g., Audi 1998, pp. 218-9). But this opens up two\nfurther problems for this conception of certainty. First, if the\ntruth of the belief is guaranteed by the subject's grounds for\nholding it, then it looks as though the certainty of the belief ought\nto be attributed to those grounds as well. That is to say, the\nbelief would be certain, not in virtue of the fact that it is\nguaranteed to be true, but rather in virtue of its relation to the\ngrounds that make that guarantee possible. This would be so\nbecause the grounds would provide a deeper explanation for the\ncertainty of the belief than would the fact that the belief is\nguaranteed to be true.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe second problem is very similar to one that arises for\nphilosophers attempting to provide an account of fallibilistic\nknowledge (i.e., knowledge that is less than certain). According\nto the standard account, the subject has fallibilistic knowledge that\n<em>p</em> when she knows that <em>p</em> on the basis of some\njustification <em>j</em>, and yet the subject's belief could have\nbeen false while still held on the basis of <em>j</em> (see, e.g.,\nBonJour 1985, p. 26, and Lehrer 1990, p. 45). Alternatively, the\nsubject knows that <em>p</em> on the basis of some justification\n<em>j</em>, but <em>j</em> does not entail the truth that <em>p</em>\n(see, e.g., Cohen 1988, p. 91; Fogelin 1994, pp. 88-9; and Jeshion\n2000, pp. 334-5). The problem with the standard account, in\neither version, is that it does not allow for fallibilistic knowledge\nof necessary truths. If it is necessarily true that <em>p</em>,\nthen the subject's belief that <em>p</em> could not have been\nfalse, regardless of what her justification for it may be like.\nAnd, if it is necessarily true that <em>p</em>, then\neverything\u2014including the subject's justification for her\nbelief\u2014will entail or guarantee that <em>p</em>. Our\nattempt to account for certainty encounters the opposite problem: it\ndoes not allow for a subject to have a belief regarding a necessary\ntruth that does <em>not</em> count as certain. If the belief is\nnecessarily true, it cannot be false\u2014even when the subject has\ncome to hold the belief for a very bad reason (say, as the result of\nguessing or wishful thinking). And, given that the beliefs are\nnecessarily true, even these bad grounds for holding the belief will\nentail or guarantee that it is true.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe best way to solve the problem for the analysis of fallibilistic\nknowledge is to focus, not on the entailment relation, but rather on\nthe probabilistic relation holding between the subject's\njustification and the proposition believed (see Reed 2002). When\nthe subject knows that <em>p</em> on the basis of justification\n<em>j</em>, and <em>P</em>(<em>p</em>/<em>j</em>) is less than 1, the\nsubject's knowledge is fallibilistic. (Although\nepistemologists will disagree about what the appropriate conception of\nprobability is, here is a crude example of how probability may figure\nin a fallibilistic epistemology. A basic historical reliabilist\nwill say that a belief is justified just in case it has been produced\nby a process that has yielded a preponderance of true beliefs.\nSo, if the process has yielded a true belief, say, 90% of the time, the\nprobability that the next belief will be true is 90%; this is so even\nif the belief in question is necessarily true and has been logically\ndeduced from a set of beliefs, each of which is necessarily\ntrue.) Adapting this solution to the problem for certainty, we\ncan say that the subject is certain that <em>p</em> when\n<em>P</em>(<em>p</em>/<em>j</em>) = 1, where <em>j</em> is the\njustification or grounds for the belief (see Van Cleve 1977 and Lewis\n1952). However, in order for <em>j</em> to impart a probability\nof 1 to <em>p</em>, it must also be the case that\n<em>P</em>(<em>j</em>) = 1. That is to say, <em>j</em> must be\ncertain for the subject before it can make anything else certain.\nBut, if we are to explain the certainty that <em>p</em> by appeal to\nthe certainty that <em>j</em>, we fall into a vicious regress.\nThe only way to stop it is to allow that some beliefs may have an\nintrinsic probability of 1 (see Russell 1948, p. 396, and Van Cleve\n1977). It is, however, difficult to see how intrinsic probability\nof this sort is possible (barring, of course, a subjectivist account of\nprobability, which could, in any case, capture only psychological\ncertainty).</p>", "<p>\n\nAccording to a third conception of certainty, a subject's\nbelief that <em>p</em> is certain when it is justified in the highest\ndegree. This is what Firth calls the\n\u201cwarrant-evaluating\u201d sense of certainty (1967, pp.\n8-12). Thus, Bertrand Russell says that \u201cA proposition is\ncertain when it has the highest degree of credibility, either\nintrinsically or as a result of argument\u201d (1948, p. 396).\nThere are various ways to understand what it means for a belief to be\ncredible or justified in the highest degree. It could mean simply\nthat the belief in question is justified as highly as any belief the\nsubject happens to hold. But, in cases where the subject does not\nhave any beliefs that are highly justified, this will imply that even a\nbelief with relatively low justification is epistemically\ncertain. Perhaps we could say instead that a belief is justified\nto the highest degree when it is justified as highly as any belief that\n<em>anyone</em> happens to hold. But this, too, leaves open the\npossibility that a belief with relatively low justification is\nepistemically certain: if all the subjects in existence are in a\ncondition of universal ignorance, all of their beliefs\u2014including\nthe best of them\u2014will have only a low level of\njustification. Perhaps, then, we should say that a belief is\njustified in the highest degree when it has the highest level of\njustification <em>possible</em>. But even this account is\nunsatisfactory. Suppose that global skepticism is necessarily\ntrue: it is a necessary truth that no subject is capable of having much\njustification for any of her beliefs; although it may seem to us as\nthough a significant degree of justification is possible, this in fact\nis incorrect. It would then be intuitively correct to say that\nevery belief falls far short of certainty, though this would not be\npermitted by the account of certainty under consideration. We may\nof course doubt that skepticism of this strong variety is correct;\nnevertheless, it should not be simply ruled out as a matter of\ndefinition.</p>", "<p>\n\nRoderick Chisholm offers a variation on the above approach.\nAccording to his first definition of certainty (where <em>h</em>,\n<em>S</em>, and <em>t</em> are variables for propositions, subjects,\nand times, respectively):</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<em>h</em> is certain for <em>S</em> at <em>t</em> =<sub>df</sub> (i)\nAccepting <em>h</em> is more reasonable for <em>S</em> at <em>t</em>\nthan withholding <em>h</em> (i.e., not accepting <em>h</em> and not\naccepting not-<em>h</em>) and (ii) there is no <em>i</em> such that\naccepting <em>i</em> is more reasonable for <em>S</em> at <em>t</em>\nthan accepting <em>h</em>. (1976, p. 27)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nClause (i) ensures that the subject has some measure of positive\njustification for <em>h</em>\u2014if she had no justification for it,\nit would be more reasonable for her to withhold with respect to\n<em>h</em>. Clause (ii) then says that those beliefs of the\nsubject are certain which are at the highest levels of justification\nfor her. However, this still leaves open the following\npossibility: <em>h</em> is the most highly justified belief the subject\nhas, but it is still not very highly justified (e.g., it may not even\nbe sufficiently justified to count as knowledge).</p>", "<p>\n\nPerhaps for this reason, Chisholm later offered a different\ndefinition of certainty:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<em>p</em> is certain for <em>S</em> =<sub>df</sub> For every\n<em>q</em>, believing <em>p</em> is more justified for <em>S</em> than\nwithholding <em>q</em>, and believing <em>p</em> is at least as\njustified for <em>S</em> as is believing <em>q</em>. (1989,\np. 12)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThis definition still has the equivalent of clause (ii) above, and\ntherefore requires the belief that is certain for the subject be the\none that is most highly justified for her. But the second\ndefinition appears to be more successful in requiring that <em>p</em>\nbe justified to a significant degree. Now, believing that\n<em>p</em> must not only be more justified for the subject than\nwithholding <em>p</em>, it must also be more justified than withholding\nwith respect to any other proposition. There are many\npropositions that we are capable of entertaining\u2014e.g., the\nproposition that the number of people alive at this precise moment is\neven\u2014where there is not the slightest reason for thinking them to\nbe either true or false (though, of course, they must be one or the\nother). In fact, given the perfect lack of evidence with respect\nto propositions of this sort, Chisholm's definition may set the\nstandard for certainty <em>too</em> high, for it is hard to see how\nthere could be any proposition one is <em>more</em> justified in\nbelieving than one is in withholding belief regarding, say, the parity\nof the number of people alive at this very moment.</p>", "<p>\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Chisholm's definition works\nonly by implicitly relying on what is a contingent feature of our\nepistemic situation. It so happens that we find ourselves in a\nposition of total ignorance with respect to some propositions.\nBut that need not have been the case. We could have ended up in a\nworld where there is a moderate amount of evidence either for or\nagainst every proposition. If one of a subject's beliefs\nthen happened to have slightly more justification than any of the\nothers, it would meet Chisholm's definition of certainty, though\nit might still have what we would intuitively take to be a less than\nideal level of justification.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere is one further problem with both of Chisholm's\ndefinitions. Because they both relativize certainty to a\nparticular subject, they make possible the following situation.\nTwo subjects each believe that <em>p</em>, and in each case the\nbelief is justified to degree <em>n</em>. For the first subject,\nthe belief counts as certain because none of her other beliefs have a\nhigher level of justification. But, for the second subject, the\nbelief in question is not certain because she does have another belief\nthat is slightly more justified. If certainty really is grounded\nin epistemic justification, though, this should not be possible.\nIf a given justification makes a belief certain for one subject, it\nshould do so for everyone.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere is another approach that Chisholm might take. According\nto <em>particularism</em>, his favored method in epistemology, we\nshould use particular instances of knowledge and justification as our\nguide in formulating an epistemology (Chisholm 1973 and 1989, pp.\n6-7). (By contrast, <em>methodism</em> begins with criteria for\nknowledge and justification and then attempts to ascertain whether, on\nthese criteria, we actually have any knowledge or justified\nbeliefs.) Adapting this approach to our present concern, the\nsuggestion is that we formulate an account of certainty in light of\nparadigmatic instances of beliefs held with certainty. Thus,\nafter giving the second definition above, Chisholm says that the\nconcept of certainty is illustrated by propositions about what he calls\n\u201cself-presenting\u201d mental states and by some logical and\nmetaphysical axioms (1989, p. 12).</p>", "<p>\n\nAlthough this particularist approach probably is the way in which\nmost philosophers think of certainty, it faces several\ndifficulties. One is that the epistemology of the <em>a\npriori</em> is far from clear. Given that we do not, apparently,\ncausally interact with necessary truths, it is hard to see how our\nminds can have access to them. A second difficulty has to do with\nknowledge of our own mental states\u2014sometimes referred to as\nknowledge <em>by acquaintance</em>. According to the\n\u201cspeckled hen\u201d problem, there are aspects of our mental\nstates, such as the rich detail of one's present visual\nexperience, that we are not capable of knowing\u2014e.g., if one is\nlooking at a speckled hen, there will be a determinate number of\nspeckles in one's visual experience, which one will not be able\nto know just in virtue of having the experience (Ayer 1940, Chisholm\n1989, Fumerton 2005). But those aspects we cannot know merely by\nbeing conscious of them are part of our conscious experience in just\nthe same way as those aspects we <em>are</em> supposed to be able to\nknow; the difficulty is specifying a principled difference between the\ntwo. Much more could be said about the first two problems, but\nthey lie beyond the scope of this article. A third difficulty is\nthat, at least <em>prima facie</em>, knowledge of one's mental\nstates seems to be of a fairly different kind from knowledge of\nnecessary truths. It is not clear, at the outset, that we are\nwarranted in taking them to be paradigmatic instances of a genuine\nepistemological kind.</p>", "<p>\n\nAccording to a fourth conception of certainty, defended by Peter\nKlein, a belief \u201cis absolutely certain just in case it is\n<em>subjectively</em> and <em>objectively</em> immune to doubt\u201d\n(1992, p. 63). He explicates this in the following way:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<em>p</em> is absolutely certain for <em>S</em> if and only if (1)\n<em>p</em> is warranted for <em>S</em> and (2) <em>S</em> is warranted\nin denying every proposition, <em>g</em>, such that if <em>g</em> is\nadded to <em>S</em>'s beliefs, the warrant for <em>p</em> is\nreduced (even if only very slightly) and (3) there is no true\nproposition, <em>d</em>, such that if <em>d</em> is added to\n<em>S</em>'s true beliefs the warrant for <em>p</em> is reduced\n(even if only very slightly). (1992, p. 63)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nKlein says that the second condition is what makes the belief\nsubjectively immune to doubt, presumably because it is the beliefs and\nexperiences that constitute <em>S</em>'s subjective perspective\nthat render her warranted in denying all propositions that would reduce\nthe warrant for <em>p</em>. However, <em>S</em>'s belief\nsystem might contain false beliefs that could warrant her in denying\nevery <em>g</em> relevant to <em>p</em>\u2014even, in some cases,\nwhere the <em>g</em> in question is itself true\u2014and so her belief\nthat <em>p</em> might meet condition (2) and yet still be false.\nCondition (3) is meant to prevent this situation; if <em>p</em> is\nfalse, the true belief that ~<em>p</em> can be added to\n<em>S</em>'s belief system, thereby reducing the warrant\n<em>S</em> has for <em>p</em>. In requiring both (2) and (3),\nthen, the account focuses on beliefs where the subject's\nsubjective situation is in a sense properly aligned with an objective\nstructure of reasons (for a similar view, see Pollock 1986).</p>", "<p>\n\nThere are two major difficulties facing a view of this sort.\nFirst, it is not clear how one belief is supposed to reduce the warrant\nfor another. Suppose that I correctly believe that I have a\nheadache and that my belief is, in an intuitive sense, absolutely\ncertain. The first condition of Klein's account is\nsatisfied: the belief is warranted in virtue of my experiencing the\nheadache. But is the second condition also satisfied? That\nis, would I be warranted in denying, say, the proposition that I do not\nin fact have a headache? If this were to be a belief added to my\nbelief system, I would of course have contradictory beliefs.\nWould that entail that the warrant for both beliefs should be\ndiminished? If the answer is yes, then my belief that I have a\nheadache is not absolutely certain. Moreover, it is hard to see\nhow <em>any</em> belief could then be absolutely certain, given that we\ncan always add to our belief systems the contradictory of any of our\nbeliefs. If the answer is no, however, there should be some\nexplanation for why the proposition that I do not have a headache can\nbe denied. Presumably, the explanation would have something to do\nwith my experiencing the headache. But then what explains the\ncertainty of the belief is the fact that it is grounded in the\nexperience; the belief's being subjectively immune to doubt is\nmerely a consequence of its certainty, and not the explanation for\nit. This would mean that the focus of the view has shifted from\nsubjective immunity to doubt to some sort of special warrant. How\nthere could be such a special warrant, though, would need an\naccount. To see the point more clearly, notice that subjective\nimmunity to doubt will be possible only in cases where the\nsubject's belief is (intuitively) absolutely certain. For\nany belief <em>b</em> that is less than certain, the following belief\ncould be added to the subject's belief system: the warrant for\n<em>b</em> could be misleading. That belief would reduce the\nsubject's warrant for <em>b</em> (even if only slightly) were it\nto be added to her belief system, but it is not a proposition the\nsubject can deny without being absolutely certain that <em>b</em> is\ntrue. The upshot, then, is that subjective immunity to doubt is\nnot well-suited to playing a role in an account of certainty.\nInstead, it looks as though our understanding of subjective immunity to\ndoubt depends on a prior grasp of what certainty is.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe second difficulty has to do with condition (3), which is\nsupposed to secure objective immunity to doubt. Although it is\nundeniable that a subject for whom condition (3) is satisfied would be\nin a desirable situation, it does not seem to be attributable to her in\nthe right sort of way\u2014and, especially, not in the way that we\nexpect certainty to be attributable to the person who is certain.\nTo see this, suppose that my warrant for the belief that <em>p</em> is\nonly moderately good. Nevertheless, my guardian angel protects my\nbelief by making sure that any proposition such that, if it were true,\nwould (when added to my belief system) reduce my warrant for\n<em>p</em>, is false. That is, my guardian angel makes sure that\nall potential defeaters for my belief are removed. Suppose, for\nexample, that I see from a great distance what looks like a hawk.\nMy guardian angel immediately annihilates all non-hawk flying objects\nin the area; the potential defeater, that there are flying objects\nindistinguishable from a hawk in the vicinity, has thus been rendered\nfalse. Although this would make my belief that <em>p</em>\nobjectively immune to doubt, insofar as (3) is satisfied, it does not\nseem as though it would carry my belief any closer to certainty.\nThe fact that the warrant for my belief is only moderately good renders\nirrelevant the work my guardian angel does in the world outside of my\nbeliefs. (Nor would the situation be helped if we stipulated that\ncondition (2) is also satisfied. Given that my belief system\ncould contain many false beliefs that might warrant me in rejecting all\npotential defeaters, my belief might be both subjectively and\nobjectively immune to doubt\u2014and yet still have a relatively low\ndegree of warrant.)</p>", "<p>\n\nIt may be that one of the four conceptions of certainty discussed\nabove could be improved so as to answer all objections. But,\nuntil that happens, it is safe to say that there is at present no\ncompletely satisfactory conception of certainty.</p>", "<p>\n\nTypically, epistemologists are concerned with the conditions under\nwhich a subject may know or be certain that <em>p</em> at a particular\nmoment. Interestingly, however, somewhat different issues arise\nfor certainty over time. As this was a primary concern for\nDescartes, who tells us in the First Meditation that he wants to\nestablish something \u201cin the sciences that was stable and likely\nto last,\u201d we can best see how those issues arise in the context\nof Descartes's epistemology (PW 2, p. 12).</p>", "<p>\n\nIn the Second Set of Objections, Mersenne poses the following\nproblem: although Descartes has argued that our ability to know\nanything depends on our first knowing that God exists and is not a\ndeceiver, it seems clear that an atheist mathematician can have the\nsame sort of mathematical knowledge as a theist. In response,\nDescartes allows that the atheist does have a clear awareness\n(<em>cognitio</em>) of simple mathematical truths, but he denies that\nthis clear awareness is \u201ctrue knowledge\n[<em>scientia</em>]\u201d (PW 2, p. 101). At first glance, it\nseems that Descartes draws the distinction between <em>cognitio</em>\nand <em>scientia</em> precisely so he can deny certainty to the atheist\nmathematician. But there is good reason to think that this is not\nwhat he has in mind.</p>", "<p>\n\nTo see this, notice that, if Descartes does not allow the atheist to\nbe able to acquire knowledge through clear and distinct perception, he\nwill fall into the so-called Cartesian Circle. This problem,\nfirst identified by Arnauld in the Fourth Set of Objections, arises if\nDescartes holds both of the following claims: (i) I can know that my\nclear and distinct perceptions are true only if I first know that a\nnon-deceiving God exists, and (ii) I can know that a non-deceiving God\nexists only if I first know that my clear and distinct perceptions are\ntrue. Because knowing one thing is a precondition for knowing the\nother, and <em>vice versa</em>, I cannot know either of them. In\nfact, however, it does not look as though Descartes does fall into the\ncircle. Although it is pretty clear that he is committed to\n(1)\u2014in the Third Meditation, he says that, \u201cif I do not\nknow [whether there is a non-deceiving God], it seems that I can never\nbe quite certain about anything else\u201d (PW 2, p. 25)\u2014there\nis no reason to take him to be committed to (ii). Descartes is\nwilling to permit the meditator to use clear and distinct perceptions\nbefore knowing that they are generally true. The clearest\nexample, of course, is the <em>cogito</em>; the meditator first comes\nto know that he exists as a thinking thing and only later comes to know\nthat his knowledge of the <em>cogito</em> is grounded in its clarity\nand distinctness. The same, then, can be said for the\nmeditator's knowledge\u2014grounded in some clearly and\ndistinctly perceived causal principles\u2014that God exists. In\nusing those principles, the meditator does not first need to have the\ngeneral knowledge that clear and distinct perceptions are true (see Van\nCleve 1979).</p>", "<p>\n\nStill, some philosophers might object that the meditator has no\nbusiness using principles that he does not know to be true.  Descartes\nwould not be sympathetic to this objection. As he says in his\nconversation with Burman, so long as the meditator is using the causal\nprinciples, \u201che is actually paying attention to them. And for as\nlong as he does pay attention to them, he is certain that he is not\nbeing deceived, and he is compelled to give his assent to them\u201d\n(PW 3, p. 334; see also PW 2, pp. 25, 48; see also Cottingham 1986,\np. 67). So, the doubt that Descartes raises with respect to clear and\ndistinct perceptions does not extend to the moments at which one is\nactually enjoying them. Rather, it is a doubt that, <em>in\ngeneral</em>, clear and distinct perception may not be a reliable\nsource of beliefs (Kenny 1968, p. 194). When Descartes introduces the\nevil demon hypothesis in the First Meditation, it is meant to\nencapsulate his ignorance of his own origin\u2014and, in particular,\nignorance of the construction of his own mind.  Without knowing that a\nnon-deceiving God exists, it is possible for the meditator that his\nmind works in such a way that it falls into error even when it is\ncontemplating the simplest questions. This doubt is chased away when\nhe actually <em>does</em> contemplate such a question, but it can\neasily return at a later time when his thoughts are turned\nelsewhere. This is the sense in which the atheist mathematician's\n<em>cognitio</em>, or clear awareness, is imperfect. Although it is\ncertain at the time the atheist has the perception, it can always be\nrendered doubtful at another time.  The theist has <em>no</em>\nadvantage over the atheist at the time each enjoys a clear and\ndistinct perception. Rather, the theist's advantage lies in the fact\nthat, armed with the certainty that a non-deceiving God exists, she\nwill <em>always</em> remain free from doubt (Descartes PW 2, p. 48;\nsee also Kenny 1968, p.  193). Consequently, she will be able to\nconstruct her scientific theories without ever falling prey to worries\nabout whether her work has value, and\u2014perhaps even more\nimportantly\u2014she will be in a position to definitively put an end\nto theoretical disagreements with others. (The Stoics make a similar\ndistinction; see Cicero <em>On Academic Scepticism</em>, p. 84.)</p>", "<p>\n\nGiven this account of Descartes's epistemology, we can now see\nthat both <em>cognitio</em> and <em>scientia</em> are varieties of, not\nonly knowledge, but certainty as well. This is an important point\nto note, for it means that certainty cannot be straightforwardly\ncharacterized in terms of indubitability. For a belief known with\ncertainty to be immune to doubt\u2014not merely at a moment but\nabsolutely\u2014it must be embedded in a coherent system of beliefs,\nall of which are known with certainty (for a similar account of\nDescartes's epistemology, see Sosa 1997, though Sosa takes\n<em>cognitio</em> to be a lower grade of knowledge than\n<em>scientia</em>; also, see Loeb 1992 on the importance of stability\nfor Descartes's epistemology). <em>Scientia</em>, or\nsystematic certainty, represents an admirable, but probably\nunattainable, goal. If humans are capable of certainty at all, it\nis surely of the sort that is capable of mixing with doubts.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "certainty"]}

It is supported by\n<em>Tractatus</em> 2.0231: \u201c[Material properties] are first\npresented by propositions \u2014 first formed by the configuration of\nobjects.\u201d This might seem to suggest that simple properties are\nnot objects but rather arise from the combining or configuring of\nobjects. The Copi-Anscombe interpretation has been taken to receive\nfurther support from <em>Tractatus</em> 3.1432:</p>", "<blockquote>\nWe must not say, \u201cThe complex sign \u2018<em>aRb</em>\u2019\nsays \u2018<em>a</em> stands in relation <em>R</em> to\n<em>b</em>;\u2019\u201d but we must say, \u201c<em>That</em>\n\u2018<em>a</em>\u2019 stands in a certain relation to\n\u2018<em>b</em>\u2019 says <em>that aRb</em>.\u201d\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThis has suggested to some commentators that relations are not,\nstrictly speaking, nameable, and so not Tractarian objects (see, for\nexample, Ricketts, 1996, Section III). It may, however, be intended\ninstead simply to bring out the point that Tractarian names are not\nconfined to particulars, but include relations between particulars; so\nthis consideration is less compelling. </p>", "<p>\nThe opposing view, according to which names include predicates and\nrelational expressions, has been defended by Erik Stenius and Merrill\nand Jaakko Hintikka, among others (Stenius, 1960, 61\u201369;\nHintikka and Hintikka, 1986, 30\u201334). It is supported by a\n<em>Notebooks</em> entry from 1915 in which objects are explicitly\nsaid to include properties and relations (<em>NB</em>, 61). It is\nfurther buttressed by Wittgenstein\u2019s explanation to Desmond Lee\n(in 1930\u20131) of <em>Tractatus</em> 2.01:\n\u201c\u2018Objects\u2019 also include relations; a proposition is\nnot two things connected by a relation. \u2018Thing\u2019 and\n\u2018relation\u2019 are on the same level.\u201d (<em>LK</em>,\n120).</p>", "<p>\nThe Anscombe-Copi reading treats the forms of elementary propositions\nas differing radically from anything we may be familiar with from\nordinary \u2014 or even Fregean \u2014 grammar. It thus respects\nWittgenstein\u2019s warning to Waismann in 1929 that \u201cThe\nlogical structure of elementary propositions need not have the\nslightest similarly with the logical structure of [non-elementary]\npropositions\u201d (<em>WWK</em>, 42).</p>", "<p>\nGoing beyond this, Wittgenstein seems once to have held that there\n<em> can be</em> no resemblance between the apparent or surface forms\nof non-elementary propositions and the forms of elementary\npropositions. In \u201cSome Remarks on Logical Form\u201d (1929) he\nsays: \u201cOne is often tempted to ask from an a priori standpoint:\nWhat, after all, can be the only forms of atomic propositions, and to\nanswer, e.g., subject-predicate and the relational propositions with\ntwo or more terms further, perhaps, propositions relating predicates\nand relations with one another, and so on. But this, I believe, is a\nmere playing with words\u201d (Klagge and Nordman, 1993, 30). A\nsimilar thought already occurs in a more compressed form in the\n<em>Tractatus</em> itself: \u201cThere cannot be a hierarchy of the\nforms of the elementary propositions. Only that which we ourselves\nconstruct can we foresee\u201d (5.556).</p>", "<p>\nIt is possible, then, that the options we began with represent a false\ndichotomy. Perhaps Wittgenstein simply did not have an antecedent\nopinion on the question whether Tractarian names will turn out to be\nnames of particulars only, particulars and universals, or whatnot. And\nit may even be that he believed that the final analysis of language\nwould (or might) reveal the names to defy such classifications\naltogether. This broader range of interpretive possibilities has only\nrecently begun to receive the attention it deserves (See Johnston\n2009).</p>", "<p>\nBy \u201cLinguistic atomism\u201d we shall understand the view that\nthe analysis of every proposition terminates in a proposition all of\nwhose genuine components are names. It is a striking fact that the\n<em>Tractatus</em> contains no explicit argument for linguistic\natomism. This fact has led some commentators \u2014 e.g., Peter\nSimons (1992) \u2014 to suppose that Wittgenstein\u2019s position\nhere is motivated less by argument than by brute intuition. And\nindeed, Wittgenstein does present some conclusions in this vicinity as\nif they required no argument. At 4.221, for example, he says:\n\u201c<em>It is obvious that</em> in the analysis of propositions we\nmust come to elementary propositions, which consist of names in\nimmediate combination\u201d (emphasis added). Nonetheless, some basic\nobservations about the <em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s conception of\nanalysis will enable us to see why Wittgenstein should have thought it\nobvious that analysis must terminate in this way. </p>", "<p>\nA remark from the <em>Philosophical Grammar</em>, written in 1936,\nthrows light on how Wittgenstein had earlier conceived of the process\nof analysis: </p>", "<blockquote>\nFormerly, I myself spoke of a \u2018complete analysis,\u2019 and I\nused to believe that philosophy had to give a definitive dissection of\npropositions so as to set out clearly all their connections and remove\nall possibilities of misunderstanding.

If there is going to be a unique final\nanalysis, each apparent name will have to be <em>uniquely</em> paired\nwith a term for a complex. So the program of analysis at which\nWittgenstein gestures, in addition to committing him to something\nanalogous to Russell\u2019s theory of descriptions, also commits him\nto the analogue of Russell\u2019s \u201cdescription theory of\nordinary names\u201d (cf. Russell 1905a). This is the idea that every\napparent name not occurring at the end of analysis is equivalent in\nmeaning to some definite description. </p>", "<p>\nWittgenstein\u2019s first definition, like Russell\u2019s, strictly\nspeaking, stands in need of a device for indicating scope, for\notherwise it would be unclear how to apply the analysis when we\nchoose, say, \u201c~<em>G</em>\u201d as our instance of\n\u201c<em>F</em>.\u201d In such a case the question would arise\nwhether the resulting instance of [3] is [5]:\n\u201c~<em>G</em>[<em>aRb</em>] = ~<em>Ga</em> &amp; ~<em>Gb</em>\n&amp; <em>aRb</em>,\u201d which corresponds to giving the term for a\ncomplex wide scope with respect to the negation operator, or whether\nit is: [6] \u201c~<em>G</em>[<em>aRb</em>] = ~[<em>Ga</em> &amp;\n<em>Gb</em> &amp; <em>aRb</em>],\u201d which corresponds to giving\nthe term for a complex narrow scope. One suspects that\nWittgenstein\u2019s intention would most likely have been to follow\nRussell\u2019s convention of reading the logical operator as having\nnarrow scope unless the alternative is expressly indicated (cf.\n<em>PM</em>, 172). </p>", "<p>\nDefinition [3] has obvious flaws.

Wittgenstein proposal thus\nmirrors Russell\u2019s in embodying the idea that it makes no sense\nto speak of the existence of immediately given (that is, named)\nsimples (cf. <em>PM</em>, 174\u20135). This is why Wittgenstein was\nlater to refer to his \u201cobjects\u201d as \u201cthat for which\nthere is neither existence nor non-existence\u201d (<em>PR</em>, 72).\nHis view seems to be that when \u2018<em>a</em>\u2019 is a\nTractarian name, what we try to say by uttering the nonsense string\n\u201c<em>a</em> exists\u201d will, strictly speaking, be\n<em>shown</em> by the fact that the final analysis of some proposition\ncontains \u2018<em>a</em>\u2019 (cf. 5.535). But of course, the\n<em>Tractatus</em> does not always speak strictly. Indeed, what is\ngenerally taken to be the ultimate conclusion of the\n<em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s so-called \u201cArgument for\nSubstance\u201d (2.021\u20132.0211) itself tries to say something\nthat can only be shown, since it asserts the <em>existence</em> of\nobjects. The sharpness of the tension here is only partly disguised by\nthe oblique manner in which the conclusion is formulated. Instead of\narguing for the existence of objects, the <em>Tractatus</em> argues\nfor the thesis that the world \u201chas substance.\u201d However,\nbecause \u201cobjects constitute the substance of the world\u201d\n(2.021), and because substance is that which <em>exists</em>\nindependently of what is the case (2.024), this is tantamount to\nsaying that objects exist. So it seems that Wittgenstein\u2019s\nargument for substance must be regarded as a part of the ladder we are\nsupposed to throw away (6.54). But having acknowledged this point, we\nshall set it aside as peripheral to our main concerns. </p>", "<p>\nThe most obvious similarity between the two sets of definitions is\nthat each seeks to provide for the elimination of what purport to be\nsemantically complex referring expressions. The most obvious\ndifference consists in the fact that Wittgenstein\u2019s definitions\nare designed to eliminate not definite descriptions, but rather terms\nfor complexes, for example the expression\n\u201c[<em>aRb</em>],\u201d which, judging by remarks in the\n<em>Notebooks</em>, is to be read: \u201c<em>a in the relation R to\nb</em>\u201d (<em>NB</em>, 48) (This gloss seems to derive from\nRussell\u2019s manner of speaking of complexes in <em>Principia\nMathematica</em>, where examples of terms for complexes include, in\naddition to \u201c<em>a</em> in the relation <em>R</em> to\n<em>b</em>,\u201d \u201c<em>a</em> having the quality\n<em>q</em>\u201d, and \u201c<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> and <em>c</em>\nstanding in the relation <em>S</em>\u201d (<em>PM</em>, 44).).

In\nWittgenstein\u2019s definition, by contrast, no single item of\nvocabulary takes over the role of indicating ontological commitment.\nThat commitment is indicated only after the <em>final</em> application\nof the definition, by the meaningfulness of the names in the fully\nanalysed proposition \u2014 or, more precisely, by the fact that\ncertain symbols are names (cf. 5.535). The somewhat paradoxical\nconsequence is that one can assert a statement of the form\n\u201c[<em>aRb</em>] exists\u201d without thereby manifesting any\nontological commitment to the complex [<em>aRb</em>] (cf.\n<em>EPB</em>, 121). What this shows is that the two theories relieve\nthe assertor of ontological commitments of quite different kinds. In\nRussell\u2019s case, the analysis \u2014 our [2] \u2014 removes a\ncommitment to an apparent propositional constituent \u2014 a\n\u201cdenoting concept\u201d\n <sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#5\" name=\"note-5\">5</a>]</sup>\n \u2014expressed by the phrase \u2018the <em>F</em>,\u2019 but it\ndoes not remove the commitment to the <em>F</em> itself. For\nWittgenstein, by contrast, the analysis shows that the assertor never\nwas ontologically committed to the complex [<em>aRb</em>] by an\nutterance of \u201c[<em>aRb</em>] exists.\u201d </p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s conception of analysis at the time of the theory of\ndescriptions \u2014 c.a. 1905 \u2014 is relatively clear: Analysis\ninvolves pairing up one sentence with another that expresses, more\nperspicuously, the very same Russellian proposition. The analysans\ncounts as more perspicuous than the analysandum because the former is\nfree of some of the latter\u2019s merely apparent ontological\ncommitments. By the time of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, however,\nthis relatively transparent conception of analysis is no longer\navailable. Having purged his ontology of propositions in 1910, Russell\ncan no longer appeal to the idea that analysans and analysandum\nexpress one and the same proposition. He now adopts \u201cthe\nmultiple relation theory of judgment,\u201d according to which the\njudgment (say) that Othello loves Desdemona, instead of being, as\nRussell had formerly supposed, a dyadic relation between the judging\nmind and the proposition <em>Othello loves Desdemona</em>, is now\ntaken to be a non-dyadic, or, in Russell\u2019s terminology,\n\u201cmultiple,\u201d relation whose terms are the judging mind and\nthose items that were formerly regarded as constituents of the\nproposition <em>Othello loves Desdemona</em> (Russell 1994, 155).\nAfter 1910 Russell can say that a speaker who sincerely assertively\nuttered the analysans (in a given context) would be guaranteed to make\nthe same judgment as one who sincerely assertively uttered the\nanalysandum (in the same context), but he can no longer explain this\naccomplishment by saying that the two sentences express the same\nproposition. </p>", "<p>\nA further departure from the earlier, relatively transparent\nconception of analysis is occasioned by Russell\u2019s resolution of\nthe set-theoretic version of his paradox. His solution involves giving\nan analysis of a sentence whose utterance could not be taken to\nexpress <em>any</em> judgment. One argues that the sentence\n\u201c{<em>x</em>: <em>\u03c6x</em>} \u03b5 {<em>x</em>:\n<em>\u03c6x</em>}\u201d is nonsense because the contextual definitions\nproviding for the elimination of class terms yield for this case a\nsentence that is itself nonsense by the lights of the theory of types\n(<em>PM</em>, 76). It\u2019s (apparent) negation is, accordingly,\nalso nonsense. In <em>Principia</em>, then, there is no very clear\nmodel of what is preserved in analysis. The best we can say is that\nRussell\u2019s contextual definitions have the feature that a\n(sincere, assertive) utterance of the analysans is guaranteed to\nexpress the same judgment as the analysandum, <em>if</em> the latter\nexpresses a judgment at all. </p>", "<p>\nSome of the unclarity in the conception of analysis introduced by\nRussell\u2019s rejection of propositions is inherited by\nWittgenstein, who similarly rejects any ontology of shadowy entities\nexpressed by sentences. In the <em>Tractatus</em> a\n\u201cproposition\u201d (<em>Satz</em>) is a \u201cpropositional\nsign in its projective relation to the world\u201d (3.12). This makes\nit seem as though any difference between propositional signs should\nsuffice for a difference between propositions, in which case analysans\nand analysandum could at best be distinct propositions with the same\ntruth conditions. </p>", "<p>\nEnough has now been said to make possible a consideration of\nWittgenstein\u2019s reasons for describing the position I have been\ncalling \u201clinguistic atomism\u201d as \u201cobvious.\u201d\nSince the model for Tractarian analysis is the replacement of apparent\nnames with (apparently) co-referring \u201cterms for\ncomplexes,\u201d together with eliminative paraphrase of the latter,\nit follows trivially that the endpoint of analysis, if there is one,\nwill contain neither \u201cterms for complexes\u201d nor expressions\nthat can be replaced by terms for complexes. </p>", "<p>\nWittgenstein, moreover, thinks it obvious that this analysis of every\nproposition <em>does</em> terminate. The reason he supposes analysis\ncannot go on forever is that he conceives an unanalyzed proposition as\n<em>deriving</em> its sense from its analysis. As <em>Tractatus</em>\n3.261 puts it: \u201cEvery defined sign signifies via those signs by\nwhich it is defined\u201d (Cf. <em>NB</em>, 46; <em>PT</em> 3.20102).\nIt follows that no proposition can have an infinite analysis, on pain\nof never acquiring a sense. So analysis must terminate in propositions\ndevoid of incomplete symbols. </p>", "<p>\nThat much, at least, <em>is</em> plausibly obvious, but unfortunately\nit does not follow that the final analysis of language will be wholly\ndevoid of complex symbols. The trouble is that for all we have said so\nfar, a fully analysed proposition might yet contain one or more\ncomplex symbols <em>that have meaning in their own right</em>.\nClearly, then, Wittgenstein was assuming that all genuine referring\nexpressions must be semantically simple: they must lack anything like\na Fregean sense. But why should that be so? The seeds of one answer\nare contained in <em>Tractatus</em> 3.3, the proposition in which\nWittgenstein enunciates his own version of Frege\u2019s context\nprinciple: \u201cOnly the proposition has sense; only in the context\nof a proposition has a name meaning\u201d (3.3). Wittgenstein\u2019s\njuxtaposition of these two claims suggests that the context principle\nis supposed to be his ground for rejecting senses for sub-sentential\nexpressions. But just how it could provide such a ground is far from\nclear. Another, more concrete, possibility is that Wittgenstein simply\naccepted the arguments Russell had given in \u201cOn Denoting\u201d\nfor rejecting senses for sub-sentential expressions. </p>", "<p>\nBy \u201cMetaphysical atomism\u201d we will understand the view that\nthe semantically simple symbols occurring in a proposition\u2019s\nfinal analysis refer to simples. The <em>Tractatus</em> does not\ncontain a <em>distinct</em> argument for this thesis, but, as we will\nsee, one uncovers the needed argument in the course of scrutinizing\nthe famous \u201cArgument for Substance\u201d of 2.0211\u20132:\n</p>", "<blockquote>\n2.0211 If the world had no substance, then whether a proposition had\nsense would depend on whether another proposition was true.\n</blockquote>", "<blockquote>\n2.0212 It would then be impossible to draw up a picture of the world\n(true or false).\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nTo see what precisely is being contended for in this argument one\nneeds to appreciate the historical resonances of Wittgenstein\u2019s\ninvocation of the notion of \u201csubstance.\u201d</p>", "<p>\nThe <em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s notion of substance is the modal\nanalogue of Kant\u2019s temporal notion. Whereas for Kant, substance\nis that which \u201cpersists\u201d (in the sense of existing at all\ntimes), for Wittgenstein it is that which, figuratively speaking,\n\u201cpersists\u201d through a \u201cspace\u201d of possible\nworlds. Tractarian substance is the \u201cunchanging\u201d in the\nmetaphorical sense of that which does not undergo existence change in\nthe passage (also metaphorical) from world to world. Less\nfiguratively, Tractarian substance is that which exists with respect\nto every possible world. For Kant, to assert that there is substance\n(in the schematized sense of the category) is to say that that there\nis some stuff such that every existence change (i.e., origination or\nannihilation) is necessarily an alteration or reconfiguration of that\nstuff. For Wittgenstein, analogously, to say that there is substance\nis to say that there are some things such that all \u201cexistence\nchanges\u201d in the metaphorical passage from world to world are\nreconfigurations of them. What undergo \u201cexistence changes\u201d\nare atomic states of affairs (configurations of objects): a state of\naffairs exists with respect to one world but fails to exist with\nrespect to another. Those things that remain in existence through\nthese existence changes, and which are reconfigured in the process,\nare Tractarian objects. It follows that the objects that\n\u201cconstitute the substance of the world\u201d (2.021) are\nnecessary existents. The <em>Tractatus </em>, rather wonderfully,\ncompresses this whole metaphorical comparison into a single remark:\n\u201cThe object is the fixed, the existing [<em>das\nBestehende</em>]; the configuration is the changing [<em>das\nWechselnde</em>].\u201d (2.0271). \u201c<em>Wechsel</em>,\u201d it\nshould be noted, is the word that Kant expressly reserves for the\nnotion of existence change as opposed to alteration\n(<em>Critique</em>, A 187/B230). (Unfortunately, however, whether\nWittgenstein had read the <em>Critique</em> in time for this\ncircumstance to have influenced his own phrasing in the\n<em>Tractatus</em> is unknown.)</p>", "<p>\nTractarian objects are what any \u201cimagined\u201d\u2014or, more\naccurately, <em>conceivable</em>\u2014world has in common with the\nreal world (2.022). Accordingly, they constitute the world\u2019s\n\u201cfixed form\u201d (2.022\u20133). \u2018Fixed\u2019 because,\nunlike the world\u2019s content, objects (existentially speaking)\nhold fast in the transition from world to world. \u2018Form\u2019\nbecause they constitute what is shared by all the worlds. (On\nWittgenstein\u2019s conception of possibility, the notion of an\n\u201calien\u201d Tractarian object \u2014 one which is\n<em>merely</em> possible \u2014 is not even intelligible). If the\nobjects make up the world\u2019s form, what makes up its content? The\nanswer, I think, is the various obtaining atomic states of affairs.\nDistinct worlds differ with respect to content because they differ\nwith respect to which possible states of affairs obtain. Notably,\npossible atomic states of affairs also allow for a distinction between\nform and content. Their form is the manner of combination of their\ncomponents, their content those components themselves (that is, their\ncontained objects). If this is right, it follows that substance\n\u2014 the totality of objects \u2014 is indeed, as Wittgenstein\nsays, \u201cboth form and content\u201d (2.024\u20135). It is at\nonce the form of the world and the content of possible states of\naffairs (These and further details of this interpretation of\nWittgenstein\u2019s conception of substance as the fixed or\nunchanging are provided in Proops 2004; see also Zalabardo 2015,\nAppendix II for more on simples, names, and necessary existents). </p>", "<p>\nAs we have seen, the immediate goal of the argument for substance is\nto establish that there are things that exist necessarily. In the\ncontext of the assumption that anything complex could fail to exist\nthrough decomposition, this conclusion entails that there are simples\n(2.021). While the argument is presented as a two-stage <em>modus\ntollens</em>, it is conveniently reconstructed as a <em>reductio ad\nabsurdum</em> (The following interpretation of the argument is a\ncompressed version of that provided in Proops 2004.

It means, simply, that we can\nframe senseful propositions. Let us now consider how we might try to\ndefend the inference from [2] to [3] on Wittgensteinian principles. As\na preliminary, note that, given Wittgenstein\u2019s equation in the\n<em>Notes on Logic</em> of having sense with having truth-poles\n(<em>NB</em>, 99), it seems reasonable to suppose that for a sentence\nto \u201chave sense\u201d with respect to a given world may be for\nit to have a truth value with respect to that world. Let us assume\nthat this is so. Now suppose that everything exists contingently.\nThen, in particular, the referents of the semantically simple symbols\noccurring in a fully analysed sentence will exist contingently. But\nthen any such sentence will contain a semantically simple symbol that\nfails to refer with respect to some possible world. Suppose, as a\nbackground assumption, that there are no contingent simples. (It will\nbe argued below that this assumption plausibly follows from certain\nTractarian commitments.) Then, if we assume that a sentence containing\na semantically simple term is neither true nor false evaluated with\nrespect to a world in which its purported referent fails to exist\n\u2014 and, for now, we do \u2014 then, for any such fully analysed\nsentence, there will be some world such that the sentence depends for\nits truth valuedness with respect to that world on the truth with\nrespect to that world of some other sentence, <em>viz</em>., the\nsentence stating that the constituents of the relevant complex are\nconfigured in a manner necessary and sufficient for its existence. It\nfollows that if everything exists contingently, then whether a\nsentence is senseful with respect to a world will depend on whether\nanother sentence is true with respect to that world.</p>", "<p>\nThe step from [3] to [4] runs as follows. Suppose that whether any\nsentence \u201chas sense\u201d (i.e., on our reading, has a\ntruth-value) depends (in the way just explained) on whether another is\ntrue. Then every sentence will have an \u201cindeterminate\nsense\u201d in the sense that it will lack a truth value with respect\nto at least one possible world. But an indeterminate sense is no sense\nat all, for a proposition by its very nature \u201creaches through\nthe whole logical space\u201d (3.42) (i.e., it is truth-valued with\nrespect to every possible\n world).<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#6\" name=\"note-6\">6</a>]</sup>\n So if every sentence depended for its \u201csense\u201d (i.e.,\ntruth-valuedness) on the truth of another, no sentence would have a\ndeterminate sense, and so no sentence would have a sense. In which\ncase we would be unable to frame senseful propositions (i.e., to\n\u201cdraw up pictures of the world true or false\u201d). </p>", "<p>\nOne apparent difficulty concerns the assumption that to have sense is\njust to be true or false. How can such a view be attributed to the\nWittgenstein of the <em>Tractatus</em> given his view that tautology,\nwhich is true, and contradiction, which is false, are without sense\n(<em>sinnlos</em>) (4.461)? The seeds of an answer may be contained in\na remark from Wittgenstein\u2019s lectures at Cambridge during the\nyear 1934\u20131935. Looking back on what he\u2019d written in the\n<em>Tractatus</em>, he says:</p>", "<blockquote>\nWhen I called tautologies senseless I meant to stress a connection\nwith a quantity of sense, namely 0. ([<em>AM</em>]), 137)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nIt is possible, then, that Wittgenstein is thinking of a\n<em>sinnlos</em> proposition as a proposition that \u201chas\nsense\u201d but has it to a zero degree. According to this\nconception, a tautology, being true, is, in contrast to a nonsensical\nstring, in the running for possessing a non-zero quantity of sense,\nbut is so constructed that, in the end, it doesn\u2019t get to have\none. And, importantly, in virtue of being in the running for having a\nnon-zero quantity of sense its possession of a zero quantity amounts\nto its, broadly speaking, \u2018having sense\u2019. Such a view,\naccording to which, for some non-count noun N, an N-less entity has N,\nbut has a zero quantity of it, is not without precedent in the\ntradition. Kant, for example, regards rest (motionlessness) as a\nspecies of motion: a zero quantity of it (Bader, Other Internet\nResources, 22\u201323). If <em>Sinnlosigkeit</em> is, similarly, a\nspecies of <em>Sinn</em>, the equation of having <em>Sinn</em> with\nbeing true or false will be preserved. To offer a full defence of this\nunderstanding of <em>Sinnlosigkeit</em> would take us too far afield,\nbut I mention it to show that the current objection is not\ndecisive.</p>", "<p>\nAnother apparent difficulty for this reconstruction arises from its\nappearing to contradict <em>Tractatus</em> 3.24, which clearly\nsuggests that if the complex entity <em>A</em> were not to exist, the\nproposition \u201c<em>F</em>[<em>A</em>]\u201d would be false,\nrather than, as the argument requires, without truth value. But the\ndifficulty is only apparent. It merely shows that 3.24 belongs to a\ntheory that assumes that the world <em>does</em> have substance. On\nthis assumption Wittgenstein can say that whenever an apparent name\noccurs that appears to mention a complex this is only because it is\nnot, after all, a genuine name \u2014 and this is what he does say.\nBut on the assumption that the world has no substance, so that\n<em>everything</em> is complex, Wittgenstein can no longer say this.\nFor now he must allow that the semantically simple symbols occurring\nin a proposition\u2019s final analysis do refer to complexes. So in\nthe context of the assumption that every proposition has a final\nanalysis, the <em>reductio</em> assumption of the argument for\nsubstance entails the falsity of 3.24. But since 3.24 is assumed to be\nfalse only in the context of a <em>reductio</em>, it is something that\nWittgenstein can consistently endorse (This solution to the apparent\ndifficulty for the present reconstruction is owed, in its essentials,\nto David Pears (see Pears 1987, 78).</p>", "<p>\nTo complete the argument it only remains to show that Tractarian\ncommitments extrinsic to the argument for substance rule out\ncontingent\n simples.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#7\" name=\"note-7\">7</a>]</sup>\n Suppose <em>a</em> is a contingent simple. Then \u201c<em>a</em>\nexists\u201d must be a contingent proposition. But it cannot be an\nelementary proposition because it will be entailed by any elementary\nproposition containing \u2018<em>a</em>,\u2019 and elementary\npropositions are logically independent (4.211). So \u201c<em>a</em>\nexists\u201d must be non-elementary, and so further analyzable. And\nyet there would seem to be no satisfactory analysis of this\nproposition on the assumption that \u2018<em>a</em>\u2019 names a\ncontingent simple \u2014 no analysis, that is to say, that is both\nintrinsically plausible and compatible with Tractarian principles.\nWittgenstein cannot analyse \u201c<em>a</em> exists\u201d as the\nproposition \u201c\u2203<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> = <em>a</em>)\u201d\nfor two reasons. First, he would reject this analysis on the grounds\nthat it makes an ineliminable use of the identity sign (5.534).\nSecond, given his analysis of existential quantifications as\ndisjunctions, the proposition \u201c\u2203<em>x</em>(<em>x</em> =\n<em>a</em>)\u201d would be further analysed as the\n<em>non-contingent</em> proposition \u201c<em>a</em> = <em>a</em>\n\u2228 <em>a</em> = <em>b</em> \u2228 <em>a</em> =\n<em>c</em>\u2026\u201d. Nor can he analyse \u201c<em>a</em>\nexists\u201d as \u201c~[ ~<em>Fa</em> &amp; ~<em>Ga</em> &amp;\n~<em>Ha</em>\u2026]\u201d \u2014 that is, as the negation of the\nconjunction of the negations of every elementary proposition involving\n\u201c<em>a</em>.\u201d To suppose that it could, is to suppose that\nthe proposition \u201c~<em>Fa</em> &amp; ~<em>Ga</em> &amp;\n~<em>Ha</em>\u2026\u201d means \u201c<em>a</em> does not\nexist,\u201d and yet by the lights of the <em>Tractatus</em> this\nproposition would <em>show</em> <em>a</em>\u2019s existence \u2014\nor, more correctly, it would show something that one tries to put into\nwords by saying \u201c<em>a</em> exists\u201d (cf. 5.535,\n<em>Corr</em>, 126)). So, pending an unforeseen satisfactory analysis\nof \u201c<em>a</em> exists,\u201d this proposition will have to be\nanalysed as a complex of propositions not involving <em>a</em>. In\nother words, \u2018<em>a</em>\u2019 will have to be treated as an\nincomplete symbol and the fact of <em>a</em>\u2019s existence will\nhave to be taken to consist in the fact that objects other than\n<em>a</em> stand configured thus and so. But that would seem to entail\nthat <em>a</em> is not simple.</p>", "<p>\nThe argument for substance may be criticized on several grounds.\nFirst, the step leading from [2] to [3] relies on the assumption that\na name fails to refer with respect to a possible world at which its\nactual-world referent does not exist. This amounts to the\ncontroversial assumption that names do not function as what Nathan\nSalmon has called \u201cobstinately rigid designators\u201d (Salmon\n1981, 34). Secondly, the step leading from [3] to [4] relies on the\nassumption that a sentence that is neither true nor false with respect\nto some possible world fails to express a sense. As Wittgenstein was\nlater to realize, the case of intuitively senseful, yet vague\nsentences plausibly constitutes a counterexample (cf. <em>PI</em>\nSection 99). Lastly, one may question the assumption that it makes\nsense to speak of a final analysis, given that the procedure for\nanalysing a sentence of ordinary language has not been made clear (See\n<em>PI</em>, Sections 60, 63\u20134, and Section 91). </p>", "<p>\nHow could we possibly know that something is a Tractarian object?\nWittgenstein has little or nothing to say on this topic in the\n<em>Tractatus</em>, and yet it is clear from his retrospective remarks\nthat during the composition of the <em>Tractatus</em> he did think it\npossible <em>in principle</em> to discover the Tractarian objects (See\n<em>AM</em>, 11 and <em>EPB</em>, 121). So it seems worth asking by\nwhat means he thought such a discovery might be made. </p>", "<p>\nSometimes, it can seem as though Wittgenstein just expected to hit\nupon the simples by reflecting from the armchair on those items that\nstruck him as most plausibly lacking in proper parts. This impression\nis most strongly suggested in the <em>Notebooks</em>, and in\nparticular in a passage from June 1915 in which Wittgenstein seems to\nexpress confidence that certain objects already within his ken either\ncount as Tractarian objects or will turn out to do so. He says:\n\u201cIt seems to me perfectly possible that patches in our visual\nfield are simple objects, in that we do not perceive any single point\nof a patch separately; the visual appearances of stars even seem\ncertainly to be so\u201d (<em>NB</em>, 64). By \u201cpatches in our\nvisual field\u201d in this context Wittgenstein means parts of the\nvisual field with no noticeable parts. In other words, <em>points</em>\nin visual space (cf. <em>KL</em>, 120). Clearly, then, Wittgenstein at\none stage believed he could specify some Tractarian objects. However,\nthe balance of the evidence suggests that this idea was short-lived.\nFor he was later to say that he and Russell had pushed the question of\nexamples of simples to one side as a matter to be settled on a future\noccasion (<em>AM</em>, 11). And when Norman Malcolm pressed\nWittgenstein to say whether when he wrote the <em>Tractatus</em> he\nhad decided on anything as an example of a \u201csimple\nobject,\u201d he had replied \u2014 according to Malcolm\u2019s\nreport \u2014 that \u201cat the time his thought had been that he\nwas a logician; and that it was not his business as a logician, to try\nto decide whether this thing or that was a simple thing or a complex\nthing, that being a purely empirical matter\u201d (Malcolm 1989,\n70).</p>", "<p>\nWittgenstein was not suggesting that the correct way to establish that\nsomething is a Tractarian object is to gather evidence that its\ndecomposition is <em>physically</em> impossible. That reading would\nonly have a chance of being correct if Wittgenstein had taken\nmetaphysical possibility to coincide with physical possibility, and\nthat is evidently not\n so.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#8\" name=\"note-8\">8</a>]</sup>\n His meaning seems rather to be just that the objects must be\ndiscovered rather than postulated or otherwise specified in advance of\ninvestigation (cf. <em>AM</em>, 11). But since Wittgenstein was later\nto accuse his Tractarian self of having entertained the concept of a\ndistinctive kind of <em>philosophical</em> discovery (see <em>WVC</em>\n182, quoted below), we must not jump \u2014 as Malcolm appears to\nhave done, to the conclusion that he conceived of the discovery in\nquestion as \u201cempirical\u201d in anything like the contemporary\nsense of the word. </p>", "<p>\nWe know that Wittgenstein denied categorically that we could\n<em>specify</em> the possible forms of elementary propositions and the\nsimples <em>a priori</em> (4.221, 5.553\u20135.5541, 5.5571). But he\ndid not deny that these forms would be revealed as the result of\nlogical analysis. In fact, he maintained precisely this view. This\nidea is not explicit in the <em>Tractatus</em>, but it is spelled out\nin a later self-critical remark from G. E. Moore\u2019s notes of\nWittgenstein\u2019s 1933 lectures at Cambridge: </p>", "<blockquote>\nI say in [the] <em>Tractatus</em> that you can\u2019t say anything\nabout [the] structure of atomic prop[osition]s: my idea being the\nwrong one, that logical analysis would reveal what it would reveal\n(entry for 6 February, 1933, Stern et. al., 2016, 252)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nSpeaking of Tractarian objects in another retrospective remark, this\ntime from a German version of the <em>Brown Book</em>, Wittgenstein\nsays: \u201cWhat these [fundamental constituents] of reality are it\nseemed difficult to say. I thought it was the job of further logical\nanalysis to discover them\u201d (<em>EPB</em> 121). These remarks\nshould be taken at face value: it is logical analysis \u2014 the\nanalysis of propositions \u2014 that is supposed to enable us to\ndiscover the forms of elementary propositions and the objects. The\nhope is that when propositions have been put into their final, fully\nanalysed forms by applying the \u201ccalculus\u201d spoken of in the\n<em>Philosophical Grammar</em> we will finally come to know the names\nand thereby the objects. Presumably, we will know the latter <em>by\nacquaintance</em> in the act of grasping propositions in their final\nanalysed forms.</p>", "<p>\nAdmittedly, Wittgenstein\u2019s denial that we can know the objects\n<em>a priori</em> looks strange given the fact that the analytical\nprocedure described in Section 2 above seems to presuppose that we\nhave a priori knowledge both of the correct analyses of ordinary names\nand of the contextual definitions by means of which terms for\ncomplexes are eliminated. But some tension in Wittgenstein\u2019s\nposition on this point is just what we should expect in view of his\nlater rather jaundiced assessment of his earlier reliance on the idea\nof philosophical discovery:</p>", "<blockquote>\nI [used to believe that] the elementary propositions could be\nspecified at a later date. Only in recent years have I broken away\nfrom that mistake. At the time I wrote in a manuscript of my book,\n\u201cThe answers to philosophical questions must never be\nsurprising. In philosophy you cannot discover anything.\u201d <em>I\nmyself, however, had not clearly enough understood this and offended\nagainst it</em>. (<em>WVC</em>, 182, emphasis added)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThe remark that Wittgenstein quotes here from \u201ca manuscript of\nthe <em>Tractatus</em>\u201d did not survive into the final version,\nbut its sentiment is clearly echoed in the related remark that there\ncan: \u201cnever be surprises in logic\u201d (6.1251). Wittgenstein\nis clear that in the <em>Tractatus</em> he had unwittingly proceeded\nas though there could be such a thing as a <em>philosophical</em>\nsurprise or discovery. His idea that the true objects would be\ndiscovered through analysis, but are nonetheless not known <em>a\npriori</em>, is plausibly one instance of this mistake.</p>", "<p>\nOn the conception of the <em>Tractatus</em>, objects are to be\ndiscovered by grasping fully analysed propositions, presumably\n<em>with</em> the awareness that they <em>are</em> fully analysed. But\nsince that is so, we shall not have fully explained how we are\nsupposed to be able to discover the simples unless we explain how, in\npractice, we can know we have arrived at the final analysis of a\nproposition. But on this point, unfortunately, Wittgenstein has little\nto say. In fact, the only hint he offers is the rather dark one\ncontained in <em>Tractatus</em> 3.24: </p>", "<blockquote>\nThat a propositional element signifies [<em>bezeichnet</em>] a complex\ncan be seen from an indeterminateness in the propositions in which it\noccurs. We know that everything is not yet determined by this\nproposition. (The notation for generality contains a prototype).\n(3.24)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nIt is an indeterminateness in propositions \u2014 whatever this might\namount to \u2014 that is supposed to alert us to the need for further\nanalysis. In Wittgenstein\u2019s view, then, we possess a positive\ntest for analyzability. However, since the notion of\n\u201cindeterminateness\u201d in question is unclear, the test is of\nlittle practical value. The indeterminateness in question is plainly\nnot the one considered in section 3: what is in question at the\npresent juncture is the indeterminateness of propositions, not of\nsenses. But what does that amount to?</p>", "<p>\nAccording to one line of interpretation, due originally to W. D. Hart\n(Hart 1971), a proposition is indeterminate when there is more than\none way it can be true. Thus if I say \u201cBarack Obama is in the\nUnited States,\u201d I leave open where in particular he might be.\nThe source of the indeterminacy is the implied generality of this\nstatement, which is tantamount to: \u201cObama is <em>somewhere</em>\nin the United States.\u201d This line of interpretation has the merit\nof promising to make sense of the closing parenthetical remark of\n3.24. But it cannot be correct. The kind of indeterminacy that\nWittgenstein has in mind at 3.24 is supposed to serve as a sign of\nfurther analysability. But Hart\u2019s notion cannot play this role,\nsince any disjunctive proposition would be indeterminate in his sense,\neven a fully analysed proposition consisting of a disjunction of\nelementary propositions.</p>", "<p>\nAccording to a second line of interpretation, a proposition is\nindeterminate in the relevant sense if the result of embedding it in\nsome context is structurally ambiguous. Consider, for example, the\nresult of embedding \u201c<em>F</em> [<em>A</em>]\u201d in the\ncontext \u201cit is not true that,\u201d where\n\u2018<em>A</em>\u2019 is temporarily treated as a semantically\nsimple term designating a complex (Keep in place the assumption that a\nsentence containing a non-referring semantically simple term is\nneither true nor false). In this case the question would arise whether\nthe result of this embedding is neither true nor false evaluated with\nrespect to a world in which <em>A</em> does not exist, or simply true.\nThe first option corresponds to giving the apparent name wide scope\nwith respect to the logical operator, the second to giving it narrow\nscope. Such a scope ambiguity could not exist if\n\u2018<em>A</em>\u2019 were a genuine Tractarian name, so its\npresence could reasonably be taken to signal the need for further\nanalysis.</p>", "<p>\nSo far, so good, but where does the business about the generality\nnotation \u201ccontaining a prototype\u201d come in? Nothing in the\npresent explanation has yet done justice to this remark. Nor does the\npresent explanation really pinpoint what it is that signals the need\nfor further analysis. That, at bottom, is the fact that we can imagine\ncircumstances in which the supposed referent of\n\u2018<em>A</em>\u2019 fails to exist. So, again, there is reason to\nbe dissatisfied with this gloss on indeterminacy. </p>", "<p>\nIt must be concluded that Wittgenstein never supplied an adequate way\nof recognizing when a proposition is fully analysed, and consequently\nthat he failed to specify a means for recognizing something as a\nTractarian object.</p>", "<p>\nWittgenstein\u2019s turn away from logical atomism may be divided\ninto two main phases. During the first phase (1928\u20139),\ndocumented in his 1929 article \u201cSome Remarks on Logical\nForm\u201d (Klagge and Nordmann, 1993, 29\u201335), Wittgenstein\nexhibits a growing dissatisfaction with certain central details of the\n<em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s logical atomism, and notably with the\nthesis of the independence of elementary propositions. During this\nphase, however, he is still working within the broad conception of\nanalysis presupposed, if not fully developed, in the\n<em>Tractatus</em>. The second phase (1931\u20132) involves a\nrevolutionary break with that very conception.</p>", "<p>\nThe so-called \u201ccolour-exclusion problem\u201d is a difficulty\nthat arises for the <em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s view that it is\nmetaphysically possible for each elementary proposition to be true or\nfalse regardless of the truth or falsity of the others (4.211). In\nview of its generality, the problem might more accurately be termed\n\u201cthe problem of the manifest incompatibility of apparently\nunanalysable statements.\u201d The problem may be stated as follows:\nSuppose that <em>a</em> is a point in the visual field. Consider the\npropositions <em>P</em>: \u201c<em>a</em> is blue at\n<em>t</em>\u201d and <em>Q</em>: \u201c<em>a</em> is red at\n<em>t</em>\u201d (supposing \u201cred\u201d and \u201cblue\u201d\nto refer to determinate shades). It is clear that <em>P</em> and\n<em>Q</em> cannot both be true; and yet, on the face of it, it seems\nthat this incompatibility (or \u201cexclusion\u201d in\nWittgenstein\u2019s parlance) is not a <em>logical\n</em>impossibility. In the <em>Tractatus</em> Wittgenstein\u2019s\nresponse was to treat the problem as merely apparent. He supposed that\nin such cases further analysis would succeed in revealing the\nincompatibility to be logical in nature:</p>", "<blockquote>\nFor two colours, <em>e.g</em>., to be at one place in the visual field\nis impossible, and indeed logically impossible, for it is excluded by\nthe logical structure of colour. Let us consider how this\ncontradiction presents itself in physics. Somewhat as follows: That a\nparticle cannot at the same time have two velocities, that is, that at\nthe same time it cannot be in two places, that is, that particles in\ndifferent places at the same time cannot be identical (6.3751)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nAs F. P. Ramsey observes in his review of the <em>Tractatus\n</em>(Ramsey, 1923), the analysis described here actually fails to\nreveal a logical incompatibility between the two statements in\nquestion; for, even granting the correctness of the envisaged\nreduction of the phenomenology of colour perception to facts about the\nvelocities of particles, the fact that one and the same particle\ncannot be (wholly) in two places at the same time still looks very\nmuch like a synthetic <em>a priori</em> truth. It turns out, however,\nthat Wittgenstein was well aware of this point. He knew that he had\nnot taken the analysis far enough to bring out a logical\ncontradiction, but he was confident that he had taken a step in the\nright direction. In a <em>Notebooks</em> entry from August 1916 he\nremarks that: \u201cThe fact that a particle cannot be in two places\nat the same time does look <em>more like</em> a logical impossibility\n[than the fact that a point cannot be red and green at the same time].\nIf we ask why, for example, then straight away comes the thought:\nWell, we should call particles that were in two places [at the same\ntime] different, and this in its turn all seems to follow from the\nstructure of space and particles\u201d (<em>NB</em>, 81; emphasis\nadded). Here Wittgenstein is <em>conjecturing</em> that it will turn\nout to be a conceptual (hence, for him <em>logical</em>) truth about\nparticles and space (and presumably also time) that particles in two\ndistinct places (at the same time) are distinct. He does not yet\npossess the requisite analyses to demonstrate this conjecture, but he\nis optimistic that they will be found. </p>", "<p>\nThe article \u201cSome Remarks on Logical Form\u201d (1929) marks\nthe end of this optimism. Wittgenstein now arrives at the view that\nsome incompatibilities cannot, after all, be reduced to logical\nimpossibilities. His change of heart appears to have been occasioned\nby a consideration of incompatibilities involving the attribution of\nqualities that admit of gradation \u2014 <em>e.g</em>., the pitch of\na tone, the brightness of a shade of colour, etc. Consider, for\nexample, the statements: \u201c<em>A</em> has exactly one degree of\nbrightness\u201d and \u201c<em>A</em> has exactly two degrees of\nbrightness.\u201d The challenge is to provide analyses of these\nstatements that bring out the logical impossibility of their being\ntrue together. What Wittgenstein takes to be the most plausible\nsuggestion \u2014 or at least a sympathetic reconstruction of it\n\u2014 adapts the standard definitions of the numerically definite\nquantifiers to the system described in the <em>Tractatus</em>,\nanalysing these claims as respectively:\n\u201c\u2203<em>x</em>(<em>Bx</em> &amp; <em>A</em> has <em>x</em>)\n&amp; ~\u2203<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>(<em>Bx</em> &amp; <em>By</em>\n&amp; <em>A</em> has <em>x</em> and <em>A</em> has <em>y</em>)\u201d\n(\u201c<em>Bx</em>\u201d means \u201c<em>x</em> is a degree of\nbrightness\u201d) and \u201c\u2203<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>(<em>Bx</em>\n&amp; <em>By</em> &amp; <em>A</em> has <em>x</em> and <em>A</em> has\n<em>y</em>) &amp; ~\u2203<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>(<em>Bx</em>\n&amp; <em>By</em> &amp; <em>Bz</em> &amp; <em>A</em> has <em>x</em>\n&amp; <em>A</em> has <em>y</em> &amp; <em>A</em> has\n<em>z</em>).\u201d But the suggestion will not do. The trouble is\nthat the analysis \u2014 absurdly \u2014 makes it seem as though\nwhen something has just one degree of brightness there could be a\nsubstantive question about which (if any) of the three mentioned in\nthe analysis of the second claim\u2014 <em>x</em> or <em>y</em> or\n<em>z</em> \u2014 it was\u2014as if a degree of brightness were a\nkind of corpuscle whose association with a thing made it bright (cf.\nKlagge and Nordmann, 33). Wittgenstein concludes that the independence\nof elementary propositions must be abandoned and that terms for real\nnumbers must enter into atomic propositions, so that the impossibility\nof something\u2019s having both exactly one and exactly two degrees\nof brightness emerges as an irreducibly mathematical impossibility.\nThis, in turn, contradicts the <em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s idea that\nall necessity is logical necessity (6.37). </p>", "<p>\nWittgenstein differs from Frege and Russell in denying that the\nsymbols for generality have meaning in isolation. Instead, the\n<em>Tractatus</em> treats them as incomplete symbols to be analysed\naway according to the following schemata:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\u2200<em>x</em>. <em>\u03a6</em>x \u2194 <em>\u03a6a</em> &amp;\n<em>\u03a6b</em> &amp; <em>\u03a6c</em>\u2026\n<br>\n\u2203<em>x</em>. <em>\u03a6x</em> \u2194 <em>\u03a6a</em> \u2228\n<em>\u03a6b</em> \u2228 <em>\u03a6c</em>\u2026\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nUniversal (existential) quantification is treated as equivalent to a\npossibly infinite conjunction (disjunction) of propositions.\nWittgenstein\u2019s dissatisfaction with this view is expressed most\nclearly in G.

His idea was rather\nthat the <em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s analysis of generality is offered\nonly for the special case in which <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>,\netc, are \u201cindividuals\u201d in Russell\u2019s sense.\nWittgenstein had supposed that in this case there is no proposition to\nexpress the supplementary clause that is needed in the other cases.\nUnfortunately, Wittgenstein does not explain why there should be no\nsuch proposition, but the answer seems likely to be the following:\nWhat we are assumed to be analysing is actually \u201cEverything is\n<em>G</em>.\u201d In this case any allegedly necessary competing\nclause \u2014 for example, \u201c<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>\netc., are the only <em>things\u201d</em> (that is, Tractarian\nobjects) \u2014 would just be a nonsense-string produced in the\nmisfired attempt to put into words something that is <em>shown</em> by\nthe fact that when analysis bottoms out it yields as names only such\nas figure in the conjunction \u201c<em>Ga</em> &amp; <em>Gb</em>\n&amp; <em>Gc</em>\u2026\u201d (cf. <em>Tractatus</em> 4.1272).</p>", "<p>\nWhat led Wittgenstein to abandon the <em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s\nanalysis of generality was his realization that he had failed\nadequately to think through the infinite case. He had proceeded as\nthough the finite case could be used as a way of thinking about the\ninfinite case, the details of which could be sorted out at a later\ndate. By 1932 he had come to regard this attitude as mistaken. The\npoint is made in a passage from the <em>Cambridge Lectures</em> whose\nmeaning can only be appreciated after some preliminary explanation.\nThe passage in question makes a crucial claim about something\nWittgenstein refers to as \u201cThe Proposition\u201d. By this\nphrase in this context he means the joint denial of all the\npropositions that are values of the propositional function\n\u201c<em>x</em> is in this room\u201d.

The upshot\ncould scarely be more important: if Wittgenstein is right, the\n<em>Tractatus</em>\u2019s very conception of the general form of the\nproposition, because it makes essential appeal to the idea of the\njoint denial of arbitrarily many values of a propositional function,\nis itself infected with confusion.</p>", "<p>\nWittgenstein, however, does not think that the confusion of kinds of\ndots was the deepest mistake he made in the <em>Tractatus</em>.

He wrote a spectrum of books for a graduated\npublic, layman to specialist. We were beguiled by the wit and a sense\nof new-found clarity with respect to central traits of reality\u201d\n(1966c, 657). </p>", "<p>\nDespite such comments, perhaps the most memorable encapsulation of\nRussell\u2019s life and work comes from Russell himself. As Russell\ntells us, </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThree passions, simple but overwhelmingly strong, have governed my\nlife: the longing for love, the search for knowledge, and unbearable\npity for the suffering of mankind. These passions, like great winds,\nhave blown me hither and thither, in a wayward course, over a great\nocean of anguish, reaching to the very verge of despair.</p>\n\n<p>\nI have sought love, first, because it brings ecstasy \u2013 ecstasy\nso great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a\nfew hours of this joy. I have sought it, next, because it relieves\nloneliness \u2013 that terrible loneliness in which one shivering\nconsciousness looks over the rim of the world into the cold\nunfathomable lifeless abyss. I have sought it finally, because in the\nunion of love I have seen, in a mystic miniature, the prefiguring\nvision of the heaven that saints and poets have imagined. This is what\nI sought, and though it might seem too good for human life, this is\nwhat \u2013 at last \u2013 I have found.</p>\n\n<p>\nWith equal passion I have sought knowledge. I have wished to\nunderstand the hearts of men. I have wished to know why the stars\nshine. And I have tried to apprehend the Pythagorean power by which\nnumber holds sway above the flux. A little of this, but not much, I\nhave achieved. </p>\n\n<p>\nLove and knowledge, so far as they were possible, led upward toward\nthe heavens. But always pity brought me back to earth. Echoes of cries\nof pain reverberate in my heart. Children in famine, victims tortured\nby oppressors, helpless old people a hated burden to their sons, and\nthe whole world of loneliness, poverty, and pain make a mockery of\nwhat human life should be. I long to alleviate this evil, but I\ncannot, and I too suffer.</p>\n\n<p>\nThis has been my life. I have found it worth living, and would gladly\nlive it again if the chance were offered me. (1967, 3\u20134)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nBy any standard, Russell led an enormously full life. In addition to\nhis ground-breaking intellectual work in logic and analytic\nphilosophy, he involved himself for much of his life in politics. As\nearly as 1904 he spoke out frequently in favour of internationalism\nand in 1907 he ran unsuccessfully for Parliament. Although he stood as\nan independent, he endorsed the full 1907 Liberal platform. He also\nadvocated extending the franchise to women, provided that such a\nradical political change could be introduced through constitutionally\nrecognized means (Wood 1957, 71). Three years later he published his\n<em>Anti-Suffragist Anxieties</em> (1910).</p>", "<p>\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Russell became involved in anti-war\nactivities and in 1916 he was fined 100 pounds for authoring an\nanti-war pamphlet. Because of his conviction, he was dismissed from\nhis post at Trinity College, Cambridge (Hardy 1942). Two years later,\nhe was convicted a second time, this time for suggesting that American\ntroops might be used to intimidate strikers in Britain (Clark 1975,\n337\u2013339). The result was five months in Brixton Prison as\nprisoner No. 2917. In 1922 and 1923 Russell ran twice more for\nParliament, again unsuccessfully, and together with his second wife,\nDora, he founded an experimental school that they operated during the\nlate 1920s and early 1930s (Russell 1926 and Park 1963). Perhaps not\nsurprisingly, some of Russell\u2019s more radical activities \u2013\nincluding his advocacy of post-Victorian sexual practices \u2013 were\nlinked in many people\u2019s minds to his atheism, made famous in\npart by his 1948 BBC debate with the Jesuit philosopher Frederick\nCopleston over the existence of God. </p>", "<p>\nAlthough Russell became the third Earl Russell upon the death of his\nbrother in 1931, Russell\u2019s radicalism continued to make him a\ncontroversial figure well through middle-age. While teaching at UCLA\nin the United States in the late 1930s, he was offered a teaching\nappointment at City College, New York. The appointment was revoked\nfollowing a series of protests and a 1940 judicial decision which\nfound him morally unfit to teach at the College (Dewey and Kallen\n1941, Irvine 1996, Weidlich 2000). The legal decision had been based\npartly on Russell\u2019s atheism and partly on his fame as an\nadvocate of free love and open marriages.</p>", "<p>\nIn 1954, Russell delivered his famous \u201cMan\u2019s Peril\u201d\nbroadcast on the BBC, condemning the Bikini H-bomb tests. A year\nlater, together with Albert Einstein, he released the Russell-Einstein\nManifesto calling for the curtailment of nuclear weapons. In 1957, he\nbecame a prime organizer of the first Pugwash Conference, which\nbrought together a large number of scientists concerned about the\nnuclear issue. He became founding president of the Campaign for\nNuclear Disarmament in 1958 and Honorary President of the Committee of\n100 in 1960. </p>", "<p>\nIn 1961, Russell was once again imprisoned, this time for a week in\nconnection with anti-nuclear protests. The media coverage surrounding\nhis conviction only served to enhance Russell\u2019s reputation and\nto further inspire the many idealistic youth who were sympathetic to\nhis anti-war and anti-nuclear message. Beginning in 1963, he began\nwork on a variety of additional issues, including lobbying on behalf\nof political prisoners under the auspices of the Bertrand Russell\nPeace Foundation.</p>", "<p>\nThroughout much of his life, Russell saw himself primarily as a writer\nrather than as a philosopher, listing \u201cAuthor\u201d as his\nprofession on his passport. As he says in his <em>Autobiography</em>,\n\u201cI resolved not to adopt a profession, but to devote myself to\nwriting\u201d (1967, 125). Upon being awarded the Nobel Prize for\nLiterature in 1950, Russell used his acceptance speech once again to emphasize \nthemes relating to his social activism. </p>", "<p>\nOver the years, Russell has served as the subject of numerous creative\nworks, including T.S. Eliot\u2019s \u201cMr Apollinax\u201d (1917),\nD.H.

The paradox\narises in connection with the set of all sets that are not members of\nthemselves. Such a set, if it exists, will be a member of itself if\nand only if it is not a member of itself. In his 1901 draft of the\n<em>Principles of Mathematics</em>, Russell summarizes the problem as\nfollows:</p>", "<blockquote>\nThe axiom that all referents with respect to a given relation form a\nclass seems, however, to require some limitation, and that for the\nfollowing reason. We saw that some predicates can be predicated of\nthemselves. Consider now those \u2026 of which this is not the case.\n\u2026 [T]here is no predicate which attaches to all of them and to\nno other terms. For this predicate will either be predicable or not\npredicable of itself. If it is predicable of itself, it is one of\nthose referents by relation to which it was defined, and therefore, in\nvirtue of their definition, it is not predicable of itself.\nConversely, if it is not predicable of itself, then again it is one of\nthe said referents, of all of which (by hypothesis) it is predicable,\nand therefore again it is predicable of itself. This is a\ncontradiction. (CP, Vol. 3, 195)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThe paradox is significant since, using classical logic, all sentences\nare entailed by a contradiction. Russell\u2019s discovery thus\nprompted a large amount of work in logic, set theory, and the\n <a href=\"../philosophy-mathematics/\">philosophy and foundations of mathematics</a>.</p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s response to the\n <a href=\"../russell-paradox/\">paradox</a>\n came between 1903 and 1908 with the development of his\n <a href=\"../type-theory/\">theory of types</a>.\n It was clear to Russell that some form of restriction needed to be\nplaced on the original comprehension (or abstraction) axiom of\nna\u00efve set theory, the axiom that formalizes the intuition that\nany coherent condition (or property) may be used to determine a set.\nRussell\u2019s basic idea was that reference to sets such as the\nso-called Russell set (the set of all sets that are not members of\nthemselves) could be avoided by arranging all sentences into a\nhierarchy, beginning with sentences about individuals at the lowest\nlevel, sentences about sets of individuals at the next lowest level,\nsentences about sets of sets of individuals at the next lowest level,\nand so on. Using a vicious circle principle similar to that adopted by\nthe mathematician Henri Poincar\u00e9, together with his so-called\n\u201cno class\u201d theory of classes (in which class terms gain\nmeaning only when placed in the appropriate context), Russell was able\nto explain why the unrestricted comprehension axiom fails:\n <a href=\"../propositional-function/\">propositional functions</a>,\n such as the function \u201c<em>x</em> is a set,\u201d may not be\napplied to themselves since self-application would involve a vicious\ncircle. As a result, all objects for which a given condition (or\npredicate) holds must be at the same level or of the same\n\u201ctype.\u201d Sentences about these objects will then always be\nhigher in the hierarchy than the objects themselves.</p>", "<p>\nAlthough first introduced in 1903, the theory of types was further\ndeveloped by Russell in his 1908 article \u201cMathematical Logic as\nBased on the Theory of Types\u201d and in the three-volume work he\nco-authored with\n <a href=\"../whitehead/\">Alfred North Whitehead</a>,\n <a href=\"../principia-mathematica/\"><em>Principia Mathematica</em></a> (1910, 1912, 1913). The theory thus admits of two\nversions, the \u201csimple theory\u201d of 1903 and the\n\u201cramified theory\u201d of 1908. Both versions of the theory\ncame under attack: the simple theory for being too weak, the ramified\ntheory for being too strong. For some, it was important that any\nproposed solution be comprehensive enough to resolve all known\nparadoxes at once. For others, it was important that any proposed\nsolution not disallow those parts of classical mathematics that\nremained consistent, even though they appeared to violate the vicious\ncircle principle. (For discussion of related paradoxes, see Chapter 2\nof the Introduction to Whitehead and Russell (1910), as well as the\nentry on\n <a href=\"../paradoxes-contemporary-logic/\">paradoxes and contemporary logic</a>\n in this encyclopedia.)</p>", "<p>\nRussell himself had recognized several of these same concerns as early\nas 1903, noting that it was unlikely that any single solution would\nresolve all the known paradoxes. Together with Whitehead, he was also\nable to introduce a new axiom, the axiom of reducibility, which\nlessened the vicious circle principle\u2019s scope of application and\nso resolved many of the most worrisome aspects of type theory. Even\nso, critics claimed that the axiom was simply too ad hoc to be\njustified philosophically. (For additional discussion see Linsky\n(1990), Linsky (2002) and Wahl (2011).)</p>", "<p>\nOf equal significance during this period was Russell\u2019s defense\nof logicism, the theory that mathematics is in some important sense\nreducible to logic. First defended in his 1901 article \u201cRecent\nWork on the Principles of Mathematics,\u201d and later in greater\ndetail in his <em>Principles of Mathematics</em> and in <em>Principia\nMathematica</em>, Russell\u2019s logicism consisted of two main\ntheses. The first was that all mathematical truths can be translated\ninto logical truths or, in other words, that the vocabulary of\nmathematics constitutes a proper subset of the vocabulary of logic.\nThe second was that all mathematical proofs can be recast as logical\nproofs or, in other words, that the theorems of mathematics constitute\na proper subset of the theorems of logic. As Russell summarizes,\n\u201cThe fact that all Mathematics is Symbolic Logic is one of the\ngreatest discoveries of our age; and when this fact has been\nestablished, the remainder of the principles of mathematics consists\nin the analysis of Symbolic Logic itself\u201d (1903, 5).</p>", "<p>\nLike\n <a href=\"../frege/\">Gottlob Frege</a>,\n Russell\u2019s basic idea for defending logicism was that numbers\nmay be identified with classes of classes and that number-theoretic\nstatements may be explained in terms of quantifiers and identity. Thus\nthe number 1 is to be identified with the class of all unit classes,\nthe number 2 with the class of all two-membered classes, and so on.\nStatements such as \u201cThere are at least two books\u201d would be\nrecast as statements such as \u201cThere is a book, <em>x</em>, and\nthere is a book, <em>y</em>, and <em>x</em> is not identical to\n<em>y</em>.\u201d Statements such as \u201cThere are exactly two\nbooks\u201d would be recast as \u201cThere is a book, <em>x</em>,\nand there is a book, <em>y</em>, and <em>x</em> is not identical to\n<em>y</em>, and if there is a book, <em>z</em>, then <em>z</em> is\nidentical to either <em>x</em> or <em>y</em>.\u201d It follows that\nnumber-theoretic operations may then be explained in terms of\nset-theoretic operations such as intersection, union, and difference.\nIn <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, Whitehead and Russell were able to\nprovide many detailed derivations of major theorems in set theory,\nfinite and transfinite arithmetic, and elementary measure theory. They\nwere also able to develop a sophisticated theory of logical relations\nand a unique method of founding the real numbers. Even so, the issue\nof whether set theory itself can be said to have been successfully\nreduced to logic remained controversial. A fourth volume on geometry\nwas planned but never completed.</p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s most important writings relating to these topics\ninclude not only his <em>Principles of Mathematics</em> (1903),\n\u201cMathematical Logic as Based on the Theory of Types\u201d\n(1908), and <em>Principia Mathematica</em> (1910, 1912, 1913), but\nalso his earlier <em>Essay on the Foundations of Geometry</em> (1897)\nand his <em>Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy</em> (1919a), the\nlast of which was written while Russell was serving time in Brixton\nPrison as a result of his anti-war activities. Coincidentally, it was\nat roughly this same time that\n <a href=\"../wittgenstein/\">Ludwig Wittgenstein</a>,\n Russell\u2019s most famous pupil, was completing his <em>Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus</em> (1921) while being detained as a prisoner of\nwar at Monte Cassino in Italy during World War I. </p>", "<p>\nAnyone needing assistance in deciphering the symbolism found in the\nmore technical of Russell\u2019s writings is encouraged to consult\nthe\n <a href=\"../pm-notation/\">Notation in <em>Principia Mathematica</em></a>\n entry in this encyclopedia.</p>", "<p>\nIn much the same way that Russell used logic in an attempt to clarify\nissues in the foundations of mathematics, he also used logic in an\nattempt to clarify issues in philosophy. As one of the founders of\nanalytic philosophy, Russell made significant contributions to a wide\nvariety of areas, including\n <a href=\"../metaphysics/\">metaphysics</a>,\n epistemology,\n <a href=\"../russell-moral/\">ethics</a>\n and political theory. His advances in logic and metaphysics also had\nsignificant influence on Rudolf Carnap and the\n <a href=\"../vienna-circle/\">Vienna Circle</a>.\n </p>", "<p>\nAccording to Russell, it is the philosopher\u2019s job to discover a\nlogically ideal language \u2013 a language capable of describing the\nworld in such a way that we will not be misled by the accidental,\nimprecise surface structure of natural language. As Russell writes,\n\u201cOrdinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what\nphysics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not\nsufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say\nas little as the physicist means to say\u201d (1931, 82). Just as\natomic facts (the association of properties and relations with\nindividuals) combine to form molecular facts in the world itself, such\na language will allow for the description of such combinations using\nlogical connectives such as \u201cand\u201d and \u201cor.\u201d In\naddition to the existence of atomic and molecular facts, Russell also\nheld that general facts (facts about \u201call\u201d of something)\nare needed to complete our picture of the world. Famously, he\nvacillated on whether negative facts are also required (1918, 1919).\n</p>", "<p>\nThe reason Russell believes many ordinarily accepted statements are\nopen to doubt is that they appear to refer to entities that may be\nknown only through inference. Thus, underlying Russell\u2019s various\nprojects was not only his use of logical analysis, but also his\nlong-standing aim of discovering whether, and to what extent,\nknowledge is possible. \u201cThere is one great question,\u201d he\nwrites in 1911. \u201cCan human beings <em>know</em> anything, and if\nso, what and how? This question is really the most essentially\nphilosophical of all questions\u201d (quoted in Slater 1994, 67).</p>", "<p>\nMotivating this question was the traditional problem of the external\nworld. If our knowledge of the external world comes through inferences\nto the best explanation, and if such inferences are always fallible,\nwhat guarantee do we have that our beliefs are true?\nRussell\u2019s response to this question was partly metaphysical and\npartly epistemological. On the metaphysical side, Russell developed\nhis famous theory of\n <a href=\"../logical-atomism/\">logical atomism</a>,\n in which the world is said to consist of a complex of logical atoms\n(such as \u201clittle patches of colour\u201d) and their properties\nand relations. (The theory was crucial for influencing\n <a href=\"../wittgenstein-atomism/\">Wittgenstein\u2019s theory</a>\n of the same name.) Together these atoms and their properties form the\nfacts which, in turn, combine to form logically complex objects. What\nwe normally take to be inferred entities (for example, enduring\nphysical objects) are then understood as\n <a href=\"../logical-construction/\">logical constructions</a>\n formed from the immediately given entities of sensation, viz.,\n\u201csensibilia.\u201d</p>", "<p>\nOn the epistemological side, Russell argues that it is also important\nto show how each questionable entity may be reduced to, or defined in\nterms of, another entity (or entities) whose existence is more\ncertain. For example, on this view, an ordinary physical object that\nnormally might be thought to be known only through inference may be\ndefined instead </p>", "<blockquote>\nas a certain series of appearances, connected with each other by\ncontinuity and by certain causal laws. \u2026 More generally, a\n\u2018thing\u2019 will be defined as a certain series of aspects,\nnamely those which would commonly be said to be <em>of</em> the thing.\nTo say that a certain aspect is an aspect <em>of</em> a certain thing\nwill merely mean that it is one of those which, taken serially,\n<em>are</em> the thing. (1914a, 106\u2013107)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThe reason we are able to do this, says Russell, is that </p>", "<blockquote>\nour world is not wholly a matter of inference. There are things that\nwe know without asking the opinion of men of science. If you are too\nhot or too cold, you can be perfectly aware of this fact without\nasking the physicist what heat and cold consist of. \u2026 We may\ngive the name \u2018data\u2019 to all the things of which we are\naware without inference. (1959, 23)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nWe can then use these data (or \u201csensibilia\u201d or\n \u201c<a href=\"../sense-data/\">sense data</a>\u201d)\n with which we are directly acquainted to construct the relevant\nobjects of knowledge. Similarly, numbers may be reduced to collections\nof classes; points and instants may be reduced to ordered classes of\nvolumes and events; and classes themselves may be reduced to\npropositional functions. </p>", "<p>\nIt is with these kinds of examples in mind that Russell suggests we\nadopt what he calls \u201cthe supreme maxim in scientific\nphilosophizing,\u201d namely the principle that \u201cWhenever\npossible, logical constructions,\u201d or as he also sometimes puts\nit, \u201clogical fictions,\u201d are \u201cto be substituted for\ninferred entities\u201d (1914c, 155; cf. 1914a, 107, and 1924, 326).\nAnything that resists construction in this sense may be said to be an\nontological atom. Such objects are atomic, both in the sense that they\nfail to be composed of individual, substantial parts, and in the sense\nthat they exist independently of one another. Their corresponding\npropositions are also atomic, both in the sense that they contain no\nother propositions as parts, and in the sense that the members of any\npair of true atomic propositions will be logically independent of one\nanother. Russell believes that formal logic, if carefully developed,\nwill mirror precisely, not only the various relations between all such\npropositions, but their various internal structures as well. </p>", "<p>\nIt is in this context that Russell also introduces his famous\ndistinction between two kinds of knowledge of truths: that which is\ndirect, intuitive, certain and infallible, and that which is indirect,\nderivative, uncertain and open to error (1905, 41f; 1911, 1912, and\n1914b). To be justified, every indirect knowledge claim must be\ncapable of being derived from more fundamental, direct or intuitive\nknowledge claims. The kinds of truths that are capable of being known\ndirectly include truths about immediate facts of sensation and truths\nof logic. Examples are discussed in <em>The Problems of\nPhilosophy</em> (1912a) where Russell states that propositions with\nthe highest degree of self-evidence (what he here calls\n\u201cintuitive knowledge\u201d) include \u201cthose which merely\nstate what is given in sense, and also certain abstract logical and\narithmetical principles, and (though with less certainty) some ethical\npropositions\u201d (1912a, 109).</p>", "<p>\nEventually, Russell supplemented this distinction between direct and\nindirect knowledge of truths with his equally famous distinction\nbetween knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. As\nRussell explains, \u201cI say that I am acquainted with an object\nwhen I have a direct cognitive relation to that object, i.e. when I am\ndirectly aware of the object itself. When I speak of a cognitive\nrelation here, I do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes\njudgment, but the sort which constitutes presentation\u201d (1911,\n209). Later, he clarifies this point by adding that acquaintance\ninvolves, not knowledge of truths, but knowledge of things (1912a,\n44). Thus, while intuitive knowledge and derivative knowledge both\ninvolve knowledge of propositions (or truths), knowledge by\nacquaintance and knowledge by description both involve knowledge of\nthings (or objects). This distinction is slightly complicated by the\nfact that, even though knowledge by description is in part based upon\nknowledge of truths, it is still knowledge of things, and not of\ntruths. (I am grateful to Russell Wahl for reminding me of this\npoint.) Since it is things with which we have direct acquaintance that\nare the least questionable members of our ontology, it is these\nobjects upon which Russell ultimately bases his epistemology.</p>", "<p>\nAlso relevant was Russell\u2019s reliance upon his so-called\nregressive method (Irvine 1989, Mayo-Wilson 2011) and his eventual\nabandoning of foundationalism in favour of a more recognizably\ncoherentist approach to knowledge (Irvine 2004). As Russell puts it,\neven in logic and mathematics</p>", "<blockquote>\nWe tend to believe the premises because we can see that their\nconsequences are true, instead of believing the consequences because\nwe know the premises to be true. But the inferring of premises from\nconsequences is the essence of induction; thus the method in\ninvestigating the principles of mathematics is really an inductive\nmethod, and is substantially the same as the method of discovering\ngeneral laws in any other science. (1907, 273\u2013274)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s contributions to metaphysics and epistemology are also\nunified by his views concerning the centrality of scientific\nknowledge and the importance of there being an underlying methodology\ncommon to philosophy and science. In the case of philosophy, this\nmethodology expresses itself through Russell\u2019s use of logical\nanalysis (Hager 1994, Irvine 2004). In fact, Russell often claims that\nhe has more confidence in his methodology than in any particular\nphilosophical conclusion.</p>", "<p>\nThis broad conception of philosophy arose in part from Russell\u2019s\nidealist origins (Hylton 1990a, Griffin 1991). This is so, even though\nRussell tells us that his one, true revolution in philosophy came as a\nresult of his break from idealism. Russell saw that the idealist\ndoctrine of internal relations led to a series of contradictions\nregarding asymmetrical (and other) relations necessary for\nmathematics. As he reports, </p>", "<blockquote>\nIt was towards the end of 1898 that Moore and I rebelled against both\nKant and Hegel. Moore led the way, but I followed closely in his\nfootsteps. \u2026 [Our rebellion centred upon] the doctrine that\nfact is in general independent of experience. Although we were in\nagreement, I think that we differed as to what most interested us in\nour new philosophy.

In contrast to this doctrine, Russell proposed his\nown new doctrine of <em>external</em> relations: </p>", "<blockquote>\nThe doctrine of internal relations held that every relation between\ntwo terms expresses, primarily, intrinsic properties of the two terms\nand, in ultimate analysis, a property of the whole which the two\ncompose. With some relations this view is plausible. Take, for\nexample, love or hate. If A loves B, this relation exemplifies itself\nand may be said to consist in certain states of mind of A. Even an\natheist must admit that a man can love God. It follows that love of\nGod is a state of the man who feels it, and not properly a relational\nfact. But the relations that interested me were of a more abstract\nsort. Suppose that A and B are events, and A is earlier than B. I do\nnot think that this implies anything in A in virtue of which,\nindependently of B, it must have a character which we inaccurately\nexpress by mentioning B. Leibniz gives an extreme example. He says\nthat, if a man living in Europe has a wife in India and the wife dies\nwithout his knowing it, the man undergoes an intrinsic change at the\nmoment of her death.

If you try to\nexpress the relation of A to B by means of adjectives of A and B, you\nwill have to make the attempt by means of dates. You may say that the\ndate of A is a property of A and the date of B is a property of B, but\nthat will not help you because you will have to go on to say that the\ndate of A is earlier than the date of B, so that you will have found\nno escape from the relation. If you adopt the plan of regarding the\nrelation as a property of the whole composed of A and B, you are in a\nstill worse predicament, for in that whole A and B have no order and\ntherefore you cannot distinguish between \u201cA is earlier than\nB\u201d and \u201cB is earlier than A.\u201d As asymmetrical\nrelations are essential in most parts of mathematics, this doctrine\nwas important.

However, unlike both idealism and physicalism, neutral\nmonism holds that this single existing substance may be viewed in some\ncontexts as being mental and in others as being physical. As Russell\nputs it, </p>", "<blockquote>\n\u201cNeutral monism\u201d \u2013 as opposed to idealistic monism\nand materialistic monism \u2013 is the theory that the things\ncommonly regarded as mental and the things commonly regarded as\nphysical do not differ in respect of any intrinsic property possessed\nby the one set and not by the other, but differ only in respect of\narrangement and context.

The affinities of\na given thing are quite different in the two orders, and its causes\nand effects obey different laws. Two objects may be connected in the\nmental world by the association of ideas, and in the physical world by\nthe law of gravitation. \u2026 Just as every man in the directory\nhas two kinds of neighbours, namely alphabetical neighbours and\ngeographical neighbours, so every object will lie at the intersection\nof two causal series with different laws, namely the mental series and\nthe physical series. \u2018Thoughts\u2019 are not different in\nsubstance from \u2018things\u2019; the stream of my thoughts is a\nstream of things, namely of the things which I should commonly be said\nto be thinking of; what leads to its being called a stream of thoughts\nis merely that the laws of succession are different from the physical\nlaws.

As Russell explains, \u201cIn my mind, Caesar may call up\nCharlemagne, whereas in the physical world the two were widely\nsundered\u201d (CP, Vol. 7, 15). Even so, it is a mistake, on this\nview, to postulate two distinct types of thing (the idea of Caesar and\nthe man Caesar) that are composed of two distinct substances (the\nmental and the physical). Instead, \u201cThe whole duality of mind\nand matter, according to this theory, is a mistake; there is only one\nkind of stuff out of which the world is made, and this stuff is called\nmental in one arrangement, physical in the other\u201d (CP, Vol. 7,\n15).</p>", "<p>\nRussell appears to have developed this theory around 1913, while\nworking on his <em>Theory of Knowledge</em> manuscript and on his 1914\n<em>Monist</em> article, \u201cOn the Nature of Acquaintance.\u201d\nDecades later, in 1964, he remarked that \u201cI am not conscious of\nany serious change in my philosophy since I adopted neutral\nmonism\u201d (Eames 1967, 511). Even so, over the next several\ndecades Russell continued to do a large amount of original work,\nauthoring such important books as <em>The Analysis of Mind</em>\n(1921), <em>The Analysis of Matter</em> (1927a), <em>An Inquiry into\nMeaning and Truth</em> (1940) and <em>Human Knowledge: Its Scope and\nLimits</em> (1948).</p>", "<p>\nToday several authors, including David Chalmers (1996, 155), Thomas\nNagel (2002, 209) and Erik Banks (2014, 114), have shown renewed\ninterest in considering Russell\u2019s general approach to the mind.\n</p>", "<p>\nIn addition to the above titles by Russell, Russell\u2019s most\ninfluential writings relating to his theories of metaphysics and\nepistemology include <em>Our Knowledge of the External World</em>\n(1914a), \u201cThe Relation of Sense-Data to Physics\u201d (1914c),\n\u201cThe Philosophy of Logical Atomism\u201d (1918, 1919),\n\u201cOn Propositions: What They Are and How They Mean\u201d (1919b)\nand <em>An Outline of Philosophy</em> (1927b).</p>", "<p>\nRussell sums up his views about religion quite plainly: \u201cMy own\nview on religion is that of Lucretius.

Throughout his life, Russell thus put significant effort\ninto opposing religious ideas and institutions of all kinds. As he\nreports in his <em>Autobiography</em>, upon arriving at Brixton Prison\nin 1918, \u201cI was much cheered on my arrival by the warder at the\ngate, who had to take particulars about me.

The result was\ntwofold: first, that many people came to understand religion as a\nsubject about which they were entitled to develop their own beliefs\nand views; second, that arguments from ecclesiastical authority\nsuddenly became less formidable and less influential than they had\nbeen for centuries. In this respect, it is not too much to say that\nRussell did as much to usher in the twentieth century\u2019s age of\nsecularism as Luther did to usher in the sixteenth century\u2019s age of\nProtestantism. As the Nobel Prize committee noted, the 1950 award went\nto Russell \u201cin recognition of his varied and significant\nwritings in which he champions humanitarian ideals and freedom of\nthought\u201d (Nobel Media 2020). Russell himself reports that he\nreceived the award primarily for his anti-religious book, <em>Marriage\nand Morals</em> (1969, 30). </p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s analysis of traditional arguments in favour of the\nexistence of God appears in both his popular and his philosophical\nwritings. In his book on Leibniz, he discusses Leibniz\u2019s treatment\nof several such arguments, noting that they are \u201cthe weakest\npart in Leibniz\u2019s philosophy, the part most full of\ninconsistencies\u201d (1900, sec. 106, p. 172). In his more popular\nwritings, he repeatedly emphasizes his views about religion, noting\nthat \u201cThe fact that an opinion has been widely held is no\nevidence whatever that it is not utterly absurd\u201d (1929, 58). As\nhe writes in his 1922 booklet <em>Free Thought and Official\nPropaganda</em>, \u201cI am myself a dissenter from all known\nreligions, and I hope that every kind of religious belief will die\nout\u201d (1922a, 1). As he writes in his 1941 collection of essays\n<em>Let the People Think</em>, \u201cmodern science gives us no\nindication whatever of the existence of the soul\u201d (A1941, 113),\nand as he writes in the preface to his 1957 book <em>Why I Am Not a\nChristian and Other Essays on Religion and Related Subjects</em>,\n\u201cI am as firmly convinced that religions do harm as I am that\nthey are untrue\u201d (1957, xi).</p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s criticism of arguments traditionally offered in favour of\nthe existence of God includes his discussion of the First Cause\nArgument, the Problem of Evil, the Ontological Argument, the\nTeleological Argument, the Argument from Pre-established Harmony, the\nNatural Law Argument, the Argument from Morality, the Remediation of\nInjustice Argument and the Argument from Religious Experience.</p>", "<p>Underlying all of these discussions is Hume\u2019s suggestion that\nbelief needs to be proportioned to the available evidence, an idea\nneatly summed up in Russell\u2019s teapot analogy:</p>", "<blockquote>\nIf I were to suggest that between the Earth and Mars there is a china\nteapot revolving about the sun in an elliptical orbit, nobody would be\nable to disprove my assertion provided I were careful to add that the\nteapot is too small to be revealed even by our most powerful\ntelescopes. But if I were to go on to say that, since my assertion\ncannot be disproved, it is intolerable presumption on the part of\nhuman reason to doubt it, I should rightly be thought to be talking\nnonsense. If, however, the existence of such a teapot were affirmed in\nancient books, taught as the sacred truth every Sunday, and instilled\ninto the minds of children at school, hesitation to believe in its\nexistence would become a mark of eccentricity and entitle the doubter\nto the attentions of the psychiatrist in an enlightened age or of the\nInquisitor in an earlier time. It is customary to suppose that, if a\nbelief is widespread, there must be something reasonable about it. I\ndo not think this view can be held by anyone who has studied\nhistory. (1952, 547\u20138)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThe <em>First Cause</em> (or <em>Cosmological</em>) <em>Argument</em>\nis the argument that since everything has a cause, there must have\nbeen a first cause, and it is to this first cause that we give the\nname God. In response to this argument, Russell notes the obvious: If\neverything must have a cause, then God must have a cause. If\neverything must have a creator, then God must have a creator.\nAlternatively, if God can exist without a cause, it is just as likely\nthat the world can exist without a cause. In fact, this is even more\nlikely than the existence of an uncaused, hypothetical, supernatural\ncreator who manufactures and then intervenes in the world, since there\n\u201cis no reason to suppose that the world had a beginning at\nall\u201d (A1957, 4). To those who suggest that unlike God, since\nevery part of the world has a cause, it follows that the world itself\nmust have a cause, Russell notes that just because every man has a\nmother it does not follow that the human race must have a mother\n(A1957, 152). Put in more formal language, although causation connects\neach contingent stage of the world to the next, it need not follow\nthat there is an \u201cextramundane\u201d creator of the world as a\nwhole (1900, sec. 109, p. 176). To those who claim that without such a\ncreator, there can never be sufficient reason for \u201cwhy there are\nany states at all,\u201d Russell points out that the traditional view\nof God as being uncaused because he exists necessarily is simply\ninconsistent with the creation of a contingent universe. No series of\ncontingent states may have come about by the necessity that\naccompanies God\u2019s actions, since the contingency of existential\npropositions rests on the assertion that God acts, not from necessity\nbut contingently (1900, sec. 110, p. 177). Thus, either the world\nitself has no supernatural cause or the supernatural cause itself will\nact and exist contingently, and so it, too, cannot be necessary and must require a\ncreator.</p>", "<p>\nRelated to this argument is the <em>Problem of Evil</em>. As Russell\nnotes, the creation of a contingent world could never eliminate\nGod\u2019s responsibility for the existence of evil: </p>", "<blockquote>\nThe world, we are told, was created by a God who is both good and\nomnipotent. Before He created the world He foresaw all the pain and\nmisery that it would contain; He is therefore responsible for all of\nit. It is useless to argue that the pain in the world is due to sin.\nIn the first place, this is not true; it is not sin that causes rivers\nto overflow their banks or volcanoes to erupt. But even if it were\ntrue, it would make no difference. If I were going to beget a child\nknowing that the child was going to be a homicidal maniac, I should be\nresponsible for his crimes. If God knew in advance the sins of which\nman would be guilty, He was clearly responsible for all the\nconsequences of those sins when He decided to create man. (A1957, 22)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nIn response to the <em>Ontological Argument</em>, the argument that\nsince perfection implies existence, the idea of a non-existent,\nperfect God is self-contradictory, Russell points out that the\nargument rests ultimately on the mistaken claim that existence is a\nproperty or, in Russell\u2019s terminology, a predicate. His reasoning is\nas follows: If existence were a predicate then, like all other\npredicates, it would (or would not) be part of the nature of any given\nsubstance. But upon being created, each such substance would acquire a\nnew predicate. \u201cHence the special position of existence, as a\ncontingent and synthetic predicate, falls to the ground. If all\nsubstances always contain all their predicates, then all substances\nalways contain or do not contain the predicate existence, and God must\nbe as powerless over this predicate as over any other. To add the\npredicate existence must be metaphysically impossible. Thus, either\ncreation is self-contradictory, or, if existence is not a predicate,\nthe ontological argument is unsound\u201d (1900, sec. 115, p.\n185).</p>", "<p>\nIn response to the <em>Teleological Argument</em> (or <em>Argument\nfrom Design</em>), the argument that the complexity and purpose we\nfind in the world shows that there must have been a creator, Russell\npoints out that \u201csince the time of Darwin we understand much\nbetter why living creatures are adapted to their environment. It is\nnot that their environment was made to be suitable to them, but that\nthey grew to be suitable to it, and that is the basis of adaption.\nThere is no evidence of design about it\u201d (A1957, 6). Russell\nalso reminds his readers about the pre-Darwin observation made famous\nby David Hume, that \u201cit is a most astonishing thing that people\ncan believe that this world, with all the things that are in it, with\nall its defects,\u201d is the best that an omnipotent, omniscient\ncreator could have been able to create in millions of years. (A1957,\n6).</p>", "<p>\nIn response to the <em>Argument from Pre-established Harmony</em>, the\nargument that \u201cThe world is so well constructed, we are told,\nthat it must have had a highly skillful Architect\u201d or, as\nLeibniz preferred to say, that \u201cthe harmony of all the monads\ncan only have arisen from a common cause\u201d (1900, sec. 114, p.\n183), Russell notes that this is simply a version of the Argument from\nDesign and that \u201cBeing more palpably inadequate than any of the\nothers, it has acquired a popularity which they have never\nenjoyed\u201d (1900, sec. 114, p. 183).</p>", "<p>\nIn response to the <em>Natural Law Argument</em>, the argument that\nthe existence of laws of nature shows that there must have been a\nlawgiver, Russell points out that the argument arises simply because\nof a confusion between natural and human laws (A1957, 5). Human laws\nare commands that we choose to follow or ignore. In contrast, laws of\nnature are simply descriptions of how things in fact are. There is\nthus no need to assume a lawmaker unless the Argument from Design is\nsound, which it is not. Aternatively, if we assume there must\nhave been a lawmaker who brought about these laws, this raises the\nquestion of why the lawmaker chose to make these laws and not others:\n\u201cIf you say that He did it simply from His own good pleasure,\nand without any reason, you then find that there is something which is\nnot subject to law, and so your train of natural law is interrupted.\nIf you say, as more orthodox theologians do, that in all the laws\nwhich God issues He had a reason for giving those laws rather than\nothers \u2013 the reason, of course, being to create the best\nuniverse, although you would never think it to look at it \u2013 if\nthere was a reason for the laws which God gave, then God himself was\nsubject to law, and therefore you do not get any advantage by\nintroducing God as an intermediary\u201d (A1957, 5\u20136). In\neither case, there is no need to postulate a supernatural\nlawmaker.</p>", "<p>\nIn response to the <em>Argument from Morality</em> (or the <em>Divine\nCommand Theory Argument</em>), the argument that there could be no\nright or wrong unless God existed, Russell adapts the reply given by Socrates to Euthyphro 2,300 years earlier (Plato, <em>Euthyphro</em>,\n5d-15e). Assuming there is a difference between right and wrong, is\nthis difference due to God\u2019s commands or not? If it is, then for God\nthere must have originally been \u201cno difference between right and\nwrong, and it is no longer a significant statement to say that God is\ngood\u201d (A1957, 8). Alternatively, if we take a more traditional\ntheological line and insist that God is good, and it is for this\nreason that God commands some actions and not others, then we will\nalso have to say \u201cthat right and wrong have some meaning which\nis independent of God\u2019s fiat, because God\u2019s fiats are good and not\nbad independently of the mere fact that He made them. If you are going\nto say that, you will then have to say that it is not only through God\nthat right and wrong came into being, but that they are in their\nessence logically anterior to God\u201d (A1957, 8). Of course, we\nmight then feel compelled to suggest the existence of a superior\ndeity, one who ordered the God who created world to act as he did, but\nthis option will be of no value to the traditional theist. There is\nalso \u201cthe line that some of the gnostics took up \u2013 a line\nwhich I often thought was a very plausible one \u2013 that as a\nmatter of fact this world that we know was made by the devil at a\nmoment when God was not looking,\u201d but again, this is not the\nkind of option that would give comfort to the traditional theist\n(A1957, 8).</p>", "<p>\nIn response to the <em>Remediation of Injustice Argument</em>, the\nargument that God is needed to bring justice to the world, to ensure\nthat at the end of time the scales of justice have been balanced,\nRussell asks what evidence we have that such remediation is ever going\nto occur. \u201cIn the part of this universe that we know there is\ngreat injustice, and often the good suffer, and often the wicked\nprosper, and one hardly knows which of those is the more annoying; but\nif you are going to have justice in the universe as a whole you have\nto suppose a future life to redress the balance of life here on earth.\nSo they say that there must be a God, and there must be heaven and\nhell in order that in the long run there may be justice\u201d (A1957,\n9). Despite such wishful thinking, we have no concrete evidence that\nsuch remediation is ever going to occur: \u201cSupposing you got a crate of\noranges that you opened, and you found all the top layer of oranges\nbad, you would not argue: \u2018The underneath ones must be good, so as\nto redress the balance.\u2019 You would say: \u2018Probably the whole lot is\na bad consignment,\u2019 and that is really what a scientific person\nwould argue about the universe\u201d (A1957, 9).</p>", "<p>\nFinally, in response to the <em>Argument from Religious\nExperience</em>, the argument that people report having had direct\nexperience of the supernatural or the divine, Russell simply notes\nthat we are just as likely to make mistakes when reporting such\nexperiences as we are to make mistakes in other areas of our lives:\n\u201cIf you have jaundice you see things yellow that are not yellow.\nYou\u2019re making a mistake\u201d (A1957, 161). Thus, it is our total\nbody of evidence that needs to be considered when making such\njudgments, a body of evidence that leans heavily against the existence\nof anything divine or supernatural.</p>", "<p>\nOn the question of whether religion has impeded the advancement of\nknowledge and introduced harmful theories of morality, Russell writes\nequally plainly: \u201cThe objections to religion are of two sorts\n\u2013 intellectual and moral. The intellectual objection is that\nthere is no reason to suppose any religion true; the moral objection\nis that religious precepts date from a time when men were more cruel\nthan they are, and therefore tend to perpetuate inhumanities which the\nmoral conscience of the age would otherwise outgrow\u201d (A1957,\n23). The conclusion to be drawn, says Russell, is that religious faith\nhas served as a shield against the advancement of knowledge, both in\nethics and in the sciences: \u201cWhen two men of science disagree,\nthey do not invoke the secular arm; they wait for further evidence to\ndecide the issue, because, as men of science, they know that neither\nis infallible. But when two theologians differ, since there are no\ncriteria to which either can appeal, there is nothing for it but\nmutual hatred and an open or covert appeal to force\u201d (A1957,\n173). Today, no one </p>", "<blockquote>\nbelieves that the world was created in 4004 BC; but not so very long\nago skepticism on this point was thought an abominable crime \u2026 It is\nno credit to the orthodox that they do not now believe all the\nabsurdities that were believed 150 years ago. The gradual emasculation\nof the Christian doctrine has been effected in spite of the most\nvigorous resistance, and solely as the result of the onslaughts of\nFreethinkers (A1957, 28).\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThe tortures of the Inquisition, the condoning of slavery in the Bible\nand the Koran, the burning of women as witches, the coming together to\npray for deliverance at times of plague (which only led to the further\nspread of disease), all resulted from religious beliefs and practices.\nThe conclusion, says Russell, is obvious: \u201cthe more intense has\nbeen the religion of any period and the more profound has been the\ndogmatic belief, the greater has been the cruelty and the worse has\nbeen the state of affairs\u201d (A1957, 15).</p>", "<p>\nIn his own time, Russell was criticized severely for his view that the\nchurch\u2019s attempt to keep sexual knowledge away from the young was\n\u201cextremely dangerous to mental and physical heath\u201d (A1957,\n21). Against the practice of his time, he advocated sex education for\nthe young. He also recommended temporary, childless marriages for\nthose not ready to begin a family and held that \u201cChristian\nethics inevitably, through the emphasis laid upon sexual virtue, did a\ngreat deal to degrade the position of women\u201d (1929,\n60\u201361). In support of his view that the writings handed down by\nthe church fathers were \u201cfull of invectives against\nWoman,\u201d he quotes the historian, W.E.H. Lecky: \u201cWoman was\nrepresented as the door to hell, as the mother of all human ills. She\nshould be ashamed at the very thought that she is a woman. She should\nlive in continual penance, on account of the curses she has brought\nupon the world\u201d (1929, 61). Russell concludes that \u201cIt is\nonly in quite modern times that women have regained the degree of\nfreedom which they enjoyed in the Roman Empire\u201d (1929,\n60\u201361).</p>", "<p>\nAmong Russell\u2019s critics, it was argued that in this case and others\nlike it, Russell had simply got his facts wrong:</p>", "<blockquote>\nIt is incredible that a philosopher of note could be so unreliable, so\nunfamiliar with the fact that early Christianity has exalted the\nconception of women in the adoration given to Mary and the saints, and\nthat by treating marriage as a sacrament it emancipated women of all\nclasses from the old traditions of the absolute authority of parents\nand the seignorial power of feudal lords. It is intellectual blindness\nnot to recognize the revolutionary import of early Christianity,\nwhatever the contemporary feeling concerning the sacrament of marriage\nmay be, when it set itself like a wall against the tides of boundless\nsensuality and impressed upon the Roman world the sanctity of human\nlife. (Kayden 1930, 88)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nContrary to what was often said about his personal life, it is also\nworth noting that Russell did not practice or defend a libertine\nethic. He thought that sex was a natural need, like food and drink,\nbut that it should not be trivialized by disassociating it \u201cfrom\nserious emotion and from feelings of affection\u201d (1929, 127). As\nAlan Wood notes, the result was that \u201cMore than anyone else, he\nchanged the outlook on sex morality of a whole new generation; and\nduring his lifetime he saw the cause of Women\u2019s Rights, once\nregarded as a crank\u2019s crusade, end up as an established part of the\nlaws and customs of the land\u201d (Wood, 1957, 166). As Wood also\nnotes,</p>", "<blockquote>\nPerhaps the finest tribute to his success is that few people now even\nrealize the nature of the old ideas. Russell, it must be repeated, was\nfighting a cruel and indefensible state of affairs where sexual\nignorance was deliberately fostered, so a boy might think the changes\nof puberty were signs of some dreadful disease, and a girl might marry\nwithout knowing anything of what lay ahead of her on her bridal night;\nwere women were taught to look on sex, not as a source of joy, but of\npainful matrimonial duty; where prudery went to the extent of covering\nthe legs of pianos in draperies; where artificial mystery evoked\nmorbid curiosity, and where humbug went hand in hand with unhappiness\n\u2026 . (Wood, 1957, 174)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nUnderlying Russell\u2019s writings on religion was also his observation\nthat religion is not simply a body of doctrine but also a vehicle for\nthe expression of emotion. This explains why arguments against the\nexistence of the supernatural, although influential among\nintellectuals, are not the main driving force behind most religious\nbelief (A1957, 9). Instead, religion is based largely on fear and ignorance: our fear of the mysterious, our lack\nof knowledge of natural causes, our fear of death (A1957, 16).</p>", "<p>\nWith regard to the propositional content of religion, or what Russell\ncalls theology, Russell notes that central to the idea of Christianity\nare belief in God, belief in immortality and, at the very least,\n\u201cbelief that Christ was, if not divine, at least the best and\nwisest of men. If you are not going to believe that much about Christ,\nI do not think you have any right to call yourself a Christian\u201d\n(A1957, 2). Since it is this propositional content that varies from\nreligion to religion, it turns out, as a matter of logic, that at most\none religion can be true (A1957, xi).</p>", "<p>\nEven so, as Jack Pitt writes, Russell is more than just a\n\u201cheroic heretic hounding the sacred cows of a sterile tradition\nwhile spreading a new gospel of human freedom and secular\nenlightenment\u201d (Pitt 1975, 152). Instead, \u201cRussell sees\nreligion (as distinct from theology) as essentially a mode of feeling,\nperhaps as a set of attitudes which must have practical consequences\nfor the ethical tone and style of a person\u2019s life\u201d (Pitt 1975,\n160). Russell says much the same thing when he notes that </p>", "<blockquote>\nReligion has three main aspects. In the first place, there are a\nman\u2019s serious personal beliefs, insofar as they have to do with the\nnature of the world and the conduct of life. In the second place there\nis theology. In the third place there is institutionalized religion,\ni.e., the churches. The first of these aspects is somewhat vague, the\nbut word \u201creligion\u201d is coming more and more to be used in\nthis sense. \u2026 What makes my attitude towards religion complex is\nthat, although I consider some form of personal religion highly\ndesirable, and feel many people unsatisfactory through the lack of it,\nI cannot accept the theology of any well-known religion, and I incline\nto think that most churches at most times have done more harm than\ngood. (Schilpp 1944, 725\u20136).\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThis complexity is generated by the fact that even our most serious\nemotions and most important feelings need not result from the\npropositional content of our beliefs alone. Among Russell\u2019s most\nfamous suggestions about the nature of the good life is his\nobservation that \u201cThe good life is one inspired by love and\nguided by knowledge\u201d (A1957, 44). For Russell, this is a view so\nbasic that it is more like a goal than a description. As a result, it\nbecomes impossible to think of it as a purely descriptive claim. As\nRussell explains, </p>", "<blockquote>\nSuppose, for instance, your child is ill. Love makes you wish to cure\nit, and science tells you how to do so. There is not an intermediate\nstage of ethical theory, where it is demonstrated that your child had\nbetter be cured. Your act springs directly from desire for an end,\ntogether with knowledge of means. This is equally true of all acts,\nwhether good or bad. (A1957, 48)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThe result is that in many cases, emotion drives belief: \u201cI\ncannot, therefore, prove that my view of the good life is right; I can\nonly state my view, and hope that as many as possible will\nagree\u201d (A1957, 44).</p>", "<p>\nThese observations should not be interpreted as giving unfettered licence\nto religious belief. As Russell points out \u201csome very important\nvirtues are more likely to be found among those who reject religious\ndogmas than among those who accept them. I think this applies\nespecially to the virtue of truthfulness or intellectual integrity. I\nmean by intellectual integrity the habit of deciding vexed questions\nin accordance with the evidence, or of leaving them undecided where\nthe evidence is inconclusive\u201d (A1957, 169). In the case of\nreligion, it is not simply that such virtues are ignored. Instead,\nthey are positively frustrated: </p>", "<blockquote>\nIf theology is thought necessary to virtue and if candid inquirers see\nno reason to think the theology true, the authorities will set to work\nto discourage candid inquiry. In former centuries, they did so by\nburning the inquirers at the stake. In Russia they still have methods\nwhich are little better; but in Western countries the authorities have\nperfected somewhat milder forms of persuasion. Of these, schools are\nperhaps the most important: the young must be preserved from hearing\nthe arguments in favour of the opinions which the authorities dislike,\nand those who nevertheless persist in showing an inquiring disposition\nwill incur social displeasure and, if possible, be made to feel\nmorally reprehensible. (A1957, 171)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nSociety as well as individuals, says Russell, need to choose whether the good life is one that is guided by honest inquiry\nand the weighing of evidence, or by the familiarity of superstition\nand the comforts of religion.</p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s writings on religion and related topics include\nChapter 15 of his <em>A Critical Exposition of the Philosophy of\nLeibniz</em> (1900), as well as <em>A Free Man\u2019s Worship</em> (1923b), \n<em>Why I Am Not a Christian</em> (1927c), reprinted in\n<em>Why I am Not a Christian and Other Essays on Religion and Related\nSubjects</em> (A1957), \u201cThe Existence and Nature of God\u201d (1939), \u201cIs There a God?\u201d (1952) and <em>What I Believe</em> (A2013). </p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s significant social influence stems from three main\nsources: his long-standing social activism, his many writings on the\nsocial and political issues of his day as well as on more theoretical\nconcerns, and his popularizations of numerous technical writings in\nphilosophy and the natural sciences. </p>", "<p>\nAmong Russell\u2019s many popularizations are his two best-selling\nworks, <em>The Problems of Philosophy</em> (1912) and <em>A History of\nWestern Philosophy</em> (1945). Both of these books, as well as his\nnumerous books popularizing science, have done much to educate and\ninform generations of general readers. His <em>History</em> is still\nwidely read and did much to initiate twentieth-century research on a\nwide range of historical figures from the\n <a href=\"../presocratics/\">presocratics</a>\n to\n <a href=\"../leibniz/\">Leibniz</a>.\n His <em>Problems</em> is still used as an introductory textbook over\na century after it was first published. Both books can be read by the\nlayman with satisfaction. Other popular books, particularly those\nrelating to developments in modern science such as <em>The ABC of\nAtoms</em> (1923a) and <em>The ABC of Relativity</em> (1925), are now\nof more historical interest. Even so, they continue to convey\nsomething of the intellectual excitement associated with advances in\ntwentieth-century science and philosophy. </p>", "<p>\nNaturally enough, Russell saw a link between education in this broad\nsense and social progress. As he put it, \u201cEducation is the key\nto the new world\u201d (1926, 83). Partly this is due to our need to\nunderstand nature, but equally important is our need to understand\neach other:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nThe thing, above all, that a teacher should endeavor to produce in his\npupils, if democracy is to survive, is the kind of tolerance that\nsprings from an endeavor to understand those who are different from\nourselves. It is perhaps a natural human impulse to view with horror\nand disgust all manners and customs different from those to which we\nare used. Ants and savages put strangers to death. And those who have\nnever traveled either physically or mentally find it difficult to\ntolerate the queer ways and outlandish beliefs of other nations and\nother times, other sects and other political parties. This kind of\nignorant intolerance is the antithesis of a civilized outlook, and is\none of the gravest dangers to which our overcrowded world is exposed.\n(1950, 121)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nIt is in this same context that Russell is famous for suggesting that\na widespread reliance upon evidence, rather than superstition, would\nhave enormous social consequences: \u201cI wish to propose for the\nreader\u2019s favourable consideration,\u201d says Russell, \u201ca\ndoctrine which may, I fear, appear wildly paradoxical and subversive.\nThe doctrine in question is this: that it is undesirable to believe a\nproposition when there is no ground whatever for supposing it\ntrue\u201d (A1928, 11). </p>", "<p>\nUnlike Russell\u2019s views about the importance of education, the\nprecise connection between Russell\u2019s political activism and his\nmore theoretical work has been more controversial. In part, this has\nbeen because Russell himself repeatedly maintained that he saw no\nsignificant connection between his philosophical work and his\npolitical activism. Others have seen things differently. One of the\nbest summaries is given by Alan Wood: </p>", "<blockquote>\nRussell sometimes maintained, partly I think out of perverseness, that\nthere was no connection between his philosophical and political\nopinions. \u2026 But in fact I think there are perfectly obvious\nconnections between Russell\u2019s philosophical and other views.\n\u2026 To begin with, it is natural enough to find an analytic\nanti-monist philosopher like Russell upholding the individual against\nthe state, whereas Hegel did the reverse \u2026 [In addition, the]\nwhole bent of Russell\u2019s mind in philosophy was an attempt to\neliminate the <em>a priori</em> and to accentuate the empirical; and\nthere was exactly the same trend in his political thinking \u2026\nUnless it is realized that Russell\u2019s approach to political\nquestions was usually empirical and practical, based on the evidence\nof the moment and not on <em>a priori</em> principles and\npreconceptions, it is quite impossible to understand why his views\nappeared to vary so much. This was perfectly legitimate, and even\npraiseworthy, in a world which never stays the same, and where\nchanging circumstances continually change the balance of arguments on\ndifferent sides. (Wood 1957, 73\u20134)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThus, in addition to Russell\u2019s numerous contributions to the\npolitics of his day, he also contributed significantly to our\nunderstanding of the social world around us. Among Russell\u2019s\nmore theoretical contributions were his anticipation of John\nMackie\u2019s error theory in ethics, the view that moral judgments\nare cognitive (that is, they are either true or false), but because of\ntheir content they in fact are invariably false. (Mackie\u2019s paper\n\u201cThe Refutation of Morals\u201d appeared in 1946;\nRussell\u2019s paper \u201cIs There an Absolute Good?\u201d,\nalthough not published until 1988 was first delivered in 1922.)</p>", "<p>\nRussell also anticipated the modern theory of emotivism (as introduced\nby\n <a href=\"../ayer/\">A.J. Ayer</a>\n in his 1936 <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em>), arguing that\n\u201cPrimarily, we call something \u2018good\u2019 when we desire\nit, and \u2018bad\u2019 when we have an aversion from it\u201d\n(1927b, 242), a view that \u201che had been flirting with since\n1913\u201d (see the entry on\n <a href=\"../russell-moral/\">Russell\u2019s Moral Philosophy</a>\n in this encyclopedia; see too Schilpp 1944, 719f). Even so, Russell\nremained less than satisfied with his views on meta-ethics for most of\nhis life (CP, Vol. 11, 310). </p>", "<p>\nThis dissatisfaction appears not to have extended to his work in\npolitical theory. There Russell focused primarily on the notion of\npower, or what he called \u201cthe production of intended\neffects\u201d (1938, 35). As V.J. McGill writes, \u201cThe concept\nof power overshadows all of Russell\u2019s political and economic\nwritings\u201d (Schilpp 1944, 581). Russell himself summarizes his\npoint of view with the observation that \u201cThe laws of social\ndynamics are \u2013 so I shall contend \u2013 only capable of being\nstated in terms of power in its various forms\u201d (1938, 15). As a\nresult, it is only by understanding power in all its human\ninstantiations that we understand the social world around us. </p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s cataloging of the perceived evils of his age are well\nknown. (As Popper neatly sums up Russell\u2019s general outlook, \u201cwe\nare clever, perhaps too clever, but we are also wicked; and this\nmixture of cleverness and wickedness lies at the root of our\ntroubles\u201d [1956, 365].) Even so, underlying Russell\u2019s criticism\nof both the political left and the political right lies a common\nworry: the unequal distribution of power. As McGill sums up,\n\u201cEvidently he has become convinced that the thirst for Power is\nthe primary danger of mankind, that possessiveness is evil mainly\nbecause it promotes the power of man over man\u201d (Schilpp 1944,\n581). The problem with this analysis and of Russell\u2019s desire for\na more equitable distribution of power is that any proposed solution\nappears to lead to paradox: </p>", "<blockquote>\nSuppose certain men join a movement to disestablish Power, or to\ndistribute it more equally among the people! If they are successful,\nthey carry out the behest of Power, becoming themselves as powerful,\nin terms of Mr. Russell\u2019s definition, as any tyrant. Even though\nthey spread the good life to millions, the more successful they are,\nthe more usurpatious and dangerous. (Schilpp 1944, 586)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nLike his writings about religion, Russell\u2019s writings in ethics\nand politics brought him to the attention of large numbers of\nnon-academic readers. His most influential books on these topics\ninclude his <em>Principles of Social Reconstruction</em> (1916),\n<em>On Education</em> (1926), <em>Marriage and Morals</em> (1929),\n<em>The Conquest of Happiness</em> (1930), <em>The Scientific\nOutlook</em> (1931), and <em>Power: A New Social Analysis</em>\n(1938).</p>", "<p>\nSince his death in 1970, Russell\u2019s reputation as a philosopher\nhas continued to grow.

Both men pushed Russell to\ndevelop new theories in logic and epistemology.

Advocates of\nRussell\u2019s inclusion in the canon remind readers that few have\ndone more to advance both formal logic and analytic philosophy. As P.F. Strawson concludes, Russell\u2019s influence \u201con the philosophy of his and our time has perhaps been greater than that of any other single individual\u201d (Strawson 1984, 104). </p>", "<p> Critics of Russell\u2019s inclusion in the canon, or at least of his canonization, remind\nreaders of Russell\u2019s early enthusiasm for British imperialism\n(1967, 134) and of his controversial comments about eugenics and race\n(1929, 259, 266). Others have noted his apparent early antisemitism\nand his advocacy of a preemptive nuclear war against the Soviet Union\nfollowing World War II (Hook 1976, Stone 1981, Perkins 1994, Blitz\n2002). On the issue of a preemptive war, Russell himself later denied\nhe had ever advocated such a course of action. However, after carefully \nreviewing the historical record, biographer Ronald Clark\ncomes to a different conclusion. Clark is also unequivocal about\nRussell\u2019s lack of sincerity on the issue: \u201cIf the\nsuggestion that he deliberately tried to conceal his earlier views is\nrepugnant, the record does not really allow any other conclusion to be\ndrawn\u201d (Clark 1975, 530). Perhaps as a result of such\nobservations, many readers remain undecided when attempting to\nevaluate Russell\u2019s overall contribution to the intellectual life\nof the twentieth century. </p>", "<p>\nMonk\u2019s two volumes are a significant case in point. In addition\nto his ground-breaking biographical work, Monk relates\nWittgenstein\u2019s humorous suggestion that all of Russell\u2019s\nbooks should be bound in two colours, \u201cthose dealing with\nmathematical logic in red \u2013 and all students of philosophy\nshould read them; those dealing with ethics and politics in blue\n\u2013 and no one should be allowed to read them\u201d (Monk 2000,\n278). Others, such as Peter Stone, have argued that such caricatures\nare based on \u201ca misunderstanding of the nature of Russell as a\npolitical figure\u201d (2003, 89) and that \u201cWhatever one thinks\nof Russell\u2019s politics, he was one of the few public figures in\nthe west to stand against capitalism without succumbing to illusions\nabout Stalinist Russia. If for no other reason than this, Russell\ndeserves some credit for his political instincts\u201d (2003, 85).\n(See, for example, Russell 1920 and 1922c, and Russell et al. 1951.)</p>", "<p>\nHow is the ordinary reader to decide between such conflicting\nevaluations? Unlike the many logical advances Russell introduced, in\npolitics he is still usually understood to be more of an advocate than\na theoretician. As a result, his reputation as a political thinker has\nnot been as high as his reputation in logic, metaphysics and\nepistemology. </p>", "<p>\nEven so, regardless of his many particular contributions,\nRussell\u2019s lasting reputation has also benefited significantly\nfrom his constant willingness to abandon unsupported theories and\noutdated beliefs. To his great credit, when new evidence presented\nitself, Russell was always among the first to take it into account:\n\u201cAgainst my will, in the course of my travels, the belief that\neverything worth knowing was known at Cambridge gradually wore off. In\nthis respect,\u201d says Russell, \u201cmy travels were very useful\nto me\u201d (1967, 133). </p>", "<p>\nA short anecdote recounted in Russell\u2019s <em>Autobiography</em>\nis also typical. As a young man, he says, he spent part of each day\nfor many weeks </p>", "<blockquote>\nreading Georg Cantor, and copying out the gist of him into a notebook.\nAt that time I falsely supposed all his arguments to be fallacious,\nbut I nevertheless went through them all in the minutest detail.

{"url": "https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-atomism/", "title": "Russell\u2019s Logical Atomism", "text": ["<p>\nBertrand Russell (1872\u20131970) introduced the phrase\n\u201clogical atomism\u201d to describe his philosophy in 1911\n(<em>RA</em>, 94), and used the phrase consistently throughout the\n1910s and 1920s (<em>OKEW</em>, 12;\n<em>SMP</em>, 84; <em>PLA</em>, 178; <em>LA</em>, 323; <em>OOP</em>,\n259).  Russell\u2019s logical atomism is perhaps best described as partly a\nmethodological viewpoint, and partly a metaphysical theory. </p>", "<p>\n \nMethodologically, logical atomism can be seen as endorsement of\n<em>analysis</em>, understood as a two-step process in which one\nattempts to identify, for a given domain of inquiry, set of beliefs or\nscientific theory, the minimum and most basic concepts and vocabulary\nin which the other concepts and vocabulary of that domain can be\ndefined or recast, and the most general and basic principles from\nwhich the remainder of the truths of the domain can be derived or\nreconstructed. </p>", "<p>\n \nMetaphysically, logical atomism is the view that the world consists in\na plurality of independent and discrete entities, which by coming\ntogether form facts.  According to Russell, a fact is a kind of\ncomplex, and depends for its existence on the simpler entities making\nit up. The simplest sort of complex, an <em>atomic fact</em>, was\nthought to consist either of a single individual exhibiting a simple\nquality, or of multiple individuals standing in a simple\nrelation. </p>", "<p>\n The methodological and metaphysical elements of logical atomism come\ntogether in postulating the theoretical, if not the practical,\nrealizability of a fully analyzed language, in which all truths could\nin principle be expressed in a perspicuous manner. Such a \u201clogically\nideal language\u201d, as Russell at times called it, would, besides logical\nconstants, consist only of words representing the constituents of\natomic facts. In such a language, the simplest sort of complete\nsentence would be what Russell called an \u201catomic proposition\u201d,\ncontaining a single predicate or verb representing a quality or\nrelation along with the appropriate number of proper names, each\nrepresenting an individual. The truth or falsity of an atomic\nproposition would depend entirely on a corresponding atomic fact. The\nother sentences of such a language would be derived either by\ncombining atomic propositions using truth-functional connectives,\nyielding <em>molecular propositions</em>, or by replacing constituents\nof a simpler proposition by variables, and prefixing a universal or\nexistential quantifier, resulting in <em>general</em> and\n<em>existential propositions</em>. According to the stronger form of\nlogical atomism Russell at times adopted, he held that in such a\nlanguage, \u201c[g]iven all true atomic propositions, together with the\nfact that they are all, every other true proposition can theoretically\nbe deduced by logical methods\u201d (<em>PM2</em>, xv; cf. <em>OKEW</em>,\n50). This puts the truth or falsity of atomic propositions at the core\nof Russell\u2019s theory of truth, and hence, puts atomic facts at the\ncenter of Russell\u2019s metaphysics.</p>", "<p>\nRussell also at times suggests that analysis demonstrates that what we take to be essential or necessary properties of things and relations between things are the result of the logical forms the these things, properties and relations are logically constructed to have. This suggests that there are no such connections between simple entities, that all atomic propositions are independent of each other, and that all forms of necessity reduce to (formal) logical necessity. Some commentators interpret these theses to be central to Russell\u2019s logical atomism, though explicit commitment to them is scant in his writings.\n</p>", "<p>\n \nIn what follows, various aspects of Russell\u2019s logical atomism are\ndiscussed in greater detail. The next section discusses the origins of\nlogical atomism in the break made by Russell and G.E. Moore from the\ntradition of British Idealism, and its development during the years in\nwhich Russell worked on <em>Principia Mathematica</em>. In section 3,\nwe examine Russell\u2019s notion of analysis as a philosophical method, and\ngive various examples of analysis as Russell understood it. In section\n4, we turn to a more detailed look at certain metaphysical aspects of\nRussell\u2019s atomism, and in particular, the nature and classification of\nfacts, as well certain points of controversy regarding his views. In\nparticular, we\u2019ll examine whether or not Russell\u2019s logical\natomism necessarily presupposes a fundamental realm of ultimate\nsimples, and whether or not the atomic propositions of Russell\u2019s\natomism were understood as logically independent. The final section is\ndedicated to a discussion of the influence and reception of Russell\u2019s\nlogical atomism within the subsequent philosophical tradition.</p>", "<p>\n In 1959, Russell himself dated his first acceptance of logical\natomism to the years 1899\u20131900, when he and G.E. Moore rejected the\nmain tenets of the dominant school of philosophy in Britain at the\ntime (to which both had previously been adherents), the tradition of\nneo-Hegelian Idealism exemplified in works of F.H. Bradley and J.M.E.\nMcTaggart, and adopted instead a fairly strong form of realism\n(<em>MPD</em>,  9). Of their break with idealism, Russell wrote that\n\u201cMoore led the way, but I followed closely in his footsteps\u201d\n(<em>MPD</em>, 42). </p>", "<p>\n \nIn 1899, Moore published a paper entitled \u201cThe Nature of Judgment\u201d, in\nwhich he outlined his main reasons for accepting the new realism.  It\nbegins with a discussion of a distinction made by Bradley between\ndifferent notions of idea. According to Bradley, the notion of idea\nunderstood as a mental state or mental occurrence is not the notion of\n\u201cidea\u201d relevant to logic or to truth understood as a relationship\nbetween our ideas and reality. Instead, the relevant notion of idea is\nthat of a sign or symbol representing something other than itself, or\nan idea understood as possessing meaning. Bradley understood meaning\nin terms of \u201ca part of the content \u2026 [of an idea] cut off,\nfixed by the mind, and considered apart from the existence of the\nsign\u201d (Bradley 1883, 8). Moore agreed with Bradley that it is not\nthe mental occurrence that is important to logic.  However, with\nregard to Bradley\u2019s second notion of \u201cidea\u201d, Moore accused Bradley of\nconflating the symbol with the symbolized, and rejected Bradley\u2019s view\nthat what is symbolized is itself a part of the idea and dependent\nupon it. Moore introduces the term \u201cconcept\u201d for the meaning of a\nsymbol; for Moore, what it is for different ideas to have a common\ncontent is for them to represent the same concept. However, the\nconcept itself is independent of the ideas. When we make a judgment,\ntypically, it is not our ideas, or parts of our ideas, which our\njudgment is about. According to Moore, if I make an assertion, what I\nassert is nothing about my ideas or my mental states, but a certain\n\u201cconnexion of concepts\u201d. </p>", "<p>\n Moore went on to introduce the term \u201cproposition\u201d for complexes of\nconcepts such as that which would be involved in a belief or judgment.\nWhile propositions represent the content of judgments, according to\nMoore, they and their constituents are entirely independent from the\njudging mind. Some propositions are true, some are not. For Moore,\nhowever, truth is not a correspondence relationship between\npropositions and reality, as there is no difference between a\nproposition\u2014understood as a mind-independent complex\u2014and that which\nwould make it true (Moore 1899, 5; Moore 1901). The facts of the\nworld then consist of true propositions, themselves understood as\ncomplexes of concepts. According to Moore, something \u201cbecomes\nintelligible first when it is analyzed into its constituent concepts\u201d\n(Moore 1899, 8). \u201cThe Nature of Judgment\u201d had a profound influence\non Russell, who later heralded it as the first account of the \u201cnew\nphilosophy\u201d to which he and Moore subscribed (<em>MPD</em>, 42).</p>", "<p>\n \nFor his own part, Russell often described his dissatisfaction with the\ndominant Idealist (and largely Monist) tradition as primarily having\nto do with the nature and existence of relations. In particular,\nRussell took issue with the claim found in Bradley and others, that\nthe notion of a fundamental relation between two distinct entities is\nincoherent. Russell diagnosed this belief as stemming from a\nwidespread logical doctrine to the effect that every proposition is\nlogically of subject-predicate form. Russell was an ardent opponent of\na position known as the \u201cdoctrine of internal relations\u201d, which\nRussell stated as the view that \u201cevery relation is grounded in the\nnatures of the related terms\u201d (<em>MTT</em>, 139).  Perhaps most\ncharitably interpreted (for other interpretations considered by\nRussell, see <em>BReal</em>, 87), this amounts to the claim that\n<em>a</em>\u2019s bearing relation <em>R</em> to <em>b</em> is always\nreducible to properties held by <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>\nindividually, or to a property held by the complex formed of\n<em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</p>", "<p>\n \nIn the period leading up to his own abandonment of idealism, Russell\nwas already pursuing a research program involving the foundations of\narithmetic (see, e.g., <em>AMR</em>). This work, along with his\nearlier work on the foundations of geometry (see <em>EFG</em>), had\nconvinced him of the importance of relations for mathematics. However,\nhe found that one category of relations, viz., asymmetrical transitive\nrelations, resisted any such reduction to the properties of the relata\nor the whole formed of them. These relations are especially important\nin mathematics, as they are the sort that generates series. Consider\nthe relation of <em>being taller than</em>, and consider the fact that\nShaquille O\u2019Neal is taller than Michael Jordan. It might be thought\nthat this relation between O\u2019Neal and Jordan can be reduced to\nproperties of each: O\u2019Neal has the property of being 7\u20322\u2033 tall, and\nJordan has the property of being 6\u20326\u2033 tall, and the <em>taller\nthan</em> relation in this case is reducible to their possession of\nthese properties. The problem, according to Russell, is that for this\nreduction to hold, there must be a certain relation between the\nproperties themselves. This relation would account for the ordering of\nthe various height properties, putting the property of being-6\u20328\u2033-tall\nin between that of being-7\u20322\u2033-tall and that of being-6\u20326\u2033-tall. This\nrelation among the properties would itself be an asymmetrical and\ntransitive relation, and so the analysis has not rid us of the need\nfor taking relations as ultimate. Another hypothesis would be that\nthere is such an entity as the whole composed of O\u2019Neal and Jordan,\nand that the relation between the two men is reducible to some\nproperty of this whole.  Russell\u2019s complaint was that since the whole\ncomposed of O\u2019Neal and Jordan is the same as the whole composed of\nJordan and O\u2019Neal, this approach has no way to explain what the\ndifference would be between O\u2019Neal\u2019s being taller than Jordan and Jordan\u2019s\nbeing taller than O\u2019Neal, as both would seem to be reduced to the same\ncomposite entity bearing the same quality (see <em>POM</em>,\n221\u201326).</p>", "<p>\n \nRussell\u2019s rejection of the doctrine of internal relations is very\nimportant for understanding the development of his atomistic doctrines\nin more than one respect. Certain advocates of the claim that a\nrelation must always be grounded in the \u201cnature\u201d of its relata hold\nthat in virtue of <em>a</em> relating to <em>b</em>, <em>a</em> must\nhave a complex nature that includes its relatedness to\n<em>b</em>. Since every entity presumably bears some relation to any\nother, the \u201cnature\u201d of any entity could arguably be described as\nhaving the same complexity as the universe as a whole (if indeed, it\neven makes sense on such a picture to divide the world into distinct\nentities at all, as many denied).  Moreover, according to some within\nthis tradition, when we consider <em>a</em>, obviously we do not\nconsider all its relations to every entity, and hence grasp <em>a</em>\nin a way that falsifies the whole of what <em>a</em> is. This led\nsome to the claim that \u201canalysis is falsification\u201d, and even to hold\nthat when we judge that <em>a</em> is the father of <em>b</em>, and\njudge that <em>a</em> is the son of <em>c</em>, the <em>a</em> in the\nfirst judgment is not strictly speaking the same <em>a</em> as\ninvolved in the second judgment; instead, in the first we deal only\nwith <em>a</em>-<em>qu\u00e2-father-of-b</em> in the first, and\n<em>a</em>-<em>qu\u00e2-son-of-c</em> in the second\n(cf. <em>BReal</em>, 89; <em>MTT</em>, 140). </p>", "<p>\nIn contradistinction to these views, Russell adopted what he called\n\u201cthe doctrine of external relations\u201d, which he claimed \u201cmay be\nexpressed by saying that (1) relatedness does not imply any\ncorresponding complexity in the <em>relata</em>; (2) any given entity\nis a constituent of many different complexes\u201d (<em>BReal</em>,\n87). This position on relations allowed Russell to adopt a pluralist\nphilosophy in which the world is conceived as composed of many\ndistinct, independent entities, each of which can be considered in\nisolation from its relations to other things, or its relation to the\nmind. In 1911 Russell claimed that this doctrine was the \u201cfundamental\ndoctrine\u201d of his realistic position (<em>BReal</em>, 87;\ncf. <em>RA</em>, 92; <em>POM</em>, 226), and it represents perhaps the\nmost important turning point in the development of his logical\natomism.</p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s first published account of his newfound realism came in the\n1903 classic <em>The Principles of Mathematics</em> (<em>POM</em>).\nPart I of <em>POM</em> is dedicated largely to a philosophical inquiry\ninto the nature of propositions. Russell took over from Moore the\nconception of propositions as mind-independent complexes; a true\nproposition was then simply identified by Russell with a fact\n(cf. <em>MTCA</em>, 75\u201376). However, Moore\u2019s characterization of a\nproposition as a complex of <em>concepts</em> was largely in keeping\nwith traditional Aristotelian logic in which all judgments were\nthought to involve a subject concept, copula and predicate\nconcept.  Russell, owing in part to his own views on\nrelations, and in part from his adopting certain doctrines stemming\nfrom Peano\u2019s symbolic logic, sought to refine and improve upon this\ncharacterization. </p>", "<p>\n \nIn the terminology introduced in <em>POM</em>, constituents of a\nproposition occur either \u201cas term\u201d or \u201cas\nconcept\u201d.  An entity occurs \u201cas term\u201d when it can be\nreplaced by any other entity and the result would still be a\nproposition, and when it is one of the subjects of the proposition,\ni.e., something the proposition is \u201cabout\u201d. An entity\noccurs <em>as concept</em> when it occurs predicatively, i.e., only as\npart of the assertion made about the things occurring as term. In the\nproposition <em>Socrates is human</em>, the person Socrates (the man\nhimself) occurs as term, but humanity occurs as concept. In the\nproposition <em>Callisto orbits Jupiter</em>, Callisto (the moon\nitself) and Jupiter (the planet) occur as term, and the relation of\norbiting occurs as concept. Russell used the word\n\u201cconcept\u201d for all those entities capable of occurring as\nconcept\u2014chiefly relations and other universals\u2014and the\nword \u201cthing\u201d for those entities such as Socrates, Callisto\nand Jupiter, that can only occur as term. While Russell thought that\nonly certain entities were capable of occurring as concept, at the\ntime, he believed that every entity was capable of occurring as term\nin a proposition. In the proposition <em>Wisdom is a virtue</em>, the\nconcept wisdom occurs as term. His argument that this held generally\nwas that if there were some entity, <em>E</em>, that could not occur\nas term, there would have to be a fact, i.e., a true proposition, to\nthis effect.  However, in the proposition <em>E cannot occur as term\nin a proposition</em>, <em>E</em> occurs as term (<em>POM</em>,\n44\u201345).</p>", "<p>\n \nRussell\u2019s 1903 account of propositions as complexes of entities was in\nmany ways in keeping with his views as the nature of complexes and\nfacts during the core logical atomist period of 1911\u20131925. In\nparticular, at both stages he would regard the simple truth that an\nindividual <em>a</em> stands in the simple relation <em>R</em> to an\nindividual <em>b</em> as a complex consisting of the individuals\n<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> and the relation <em>R</em>. However, there\nare a number of positions Russell held in 1903 that were abandoned in\nthis later period; some of the more important were these: (1) in 1903,\nRussell was committed to a special kind of propositional constituent\ncalled a \u201cdenoting concept\u201d, involved in descriptive and quantified\npropositions; (2) in 1903, Russell believed that there was such a\ncomplex, i.e., a proposition, consisting of <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and\n<em>R</em> even when it is not <em>true\n</em>that <em>a</em> bears relation <em>R</em> to <em>b</em>, and\n(3) in 1903, Russell believed in the reality of classes, understood as\naggregate objects, which could be constituents of propositions. In\neach case, it is worth, at least briefly, discussing Russell\u2019s change\nof heart.</p>", "<p>\n In <em>POM</em>, Russell expressed the view that grammar is a useful\nguide in understanding the make-up of a proposition, and even that in\nmany cases, the make-up of a proposition corresponding to a sentence\ncan be understood by determining, for each word of the sentence, what\nentity in the proposition is meant by the word (<em>POM</em>,\n46). Perhaps in part because such phrases as \u201call dogs\u201d, \u201csome\nnumbers\u201d and \u201cthe queen\u201d appear as a grammatical unit, Russell came to\nthe conclusion that they made a unified contribution to the\ncorresponding proposition.  Because Russell believed it impossible for\na finite mind to grasp a proposition of infinite complexity, however,\nRussell rejected a view according to which the (false) proposition\ndesignated by</p>", "<ol>\n \n<li>All numbers are odd.</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n \nactually contains all numbers (<em>POM</em>, 145). Similarly,\nalthough Russell admitted that such a proposition as (1) is equivalent\nto a formal implication, i.e., a quantified conditional of the\nform:</p>", "<ol start=\"2\">\n \n<li>(<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em> is a number \u2283 <em>x</em> is\nodd)</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n \nRussell held that they are nevertheless distinct propositions\n(<em>POM</em>,  74). This was perhaps in part due to the difference\nin grammatical structure, and perhaps also because the former appears\nonly to be about numbers, whereas the latter is about all things,\nwhether numbers or not. Instead, Russell thought that the proposition\ncorresponding to (1) contains as a constituent the denoting concept\n<em>all numbers</em>. As Russell explained them, when denoting concepts \noccur in a proposition, the proposition is not about them but about \nother entities to which the denoting concepts bear a special\nrelation. So when the denoting concept <em>all numbers</em> occurs in\na proposition, the proposition is not about the denoting concept, but\ninstead about 1 and 2 and 3, etc.</p>", "<p>\n \nIn 1905, Russell abandoned this theory in favor of his celebrated\ntheory of definite and indefinite descriptions outlined in the paper\n\u201cOn Denoting\u201d. What precisely lead Russell to become dissatisfied with\nhis earlier theory, and the precise nature of the argument he gave\nagainst denoting concepts (and similar entities such as Frege\u2019s\nsenses), are a matter of great controversy, and have given rise to\na large body of secondary literature.  For present purposes, it can\nmerely be noted that Russell professed an inability to understand the\nlogical form of propositions <em>about</em> denoting concepts\nthemselves, as in the claim that \u201c<em>The present King of France</em>\nis a denoting concept\u201d (cf. <em>OD</em>, 48\u201350). According to the\nnew theory adopted, the proposition expressed by (1) was now\nidentified with that expressed by a quantified conditional such as\n(2). Similarly, the proposition expressed by</p>", "<ol start=\"3\">\n \n<li>Some number is odd.</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n \nwas identified with the existentially quantified conjunction\nrepresented by</p>", "<ol start=\"4\">\n \n<li>(\u2203<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em> is a number &amp; <em>x</em>\nis odd)</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n \nPerhaps most notoriously, Russell argued that a proposition involving\na definite description, e.g.,\n</p>", "<ol start=\"5\">\n \n<li>The King of France is bald.</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n \nwas to be understood as having the structure of a certain kind of\nexistential statement, in this case:</p>", "<ol start=\"6\">\n\n<li>(\u2203<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em> is King of France\n &amp; (<em>y</em>)(<em>y</em> is King of France \u2283 <em>x</em> =\n <em>y</em>) &amp; <em>x</em> is\n bald)</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n \nRussell cited in favor of these theories that they provided an elegant\nsolution to certain philosophical puzzles. One involves how it is that\na proposition can be meaningful even if it involves a description or\nother denoting phrase that does not denote anything. Given the above\naccount of the structure of the proposition expressed by \u201cthe King of\nFrance is bald\u201d, while France and the relation of <em>being King\nof</em> are constituents, there is no constituent directly\ncorresponding to the whole phrase \u201cthe King of France\u201d. The proposition in\nquestion is false, since there is no value of <em>x</em> which would\nmake it true. One is not committed to a nonexistent entity such as the\nKing of France simply in order to understand the make-up of the\nproposition.  Secondly, this theory provides an answer to how it is\nthat certain identity statements can be both true and informative. On\nthe above theory, the proposition corresponding to:</p>", "<ol start=\"7\">\n \n<li>The author of Waverly = Scott</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n \nwould be understood as having the following structure:</p>", "<ol start=\"8\">\n \n<li>(\u2203<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em>\n authored Waverly &amp; (<em>y</em>)(<em>y</em>\n authored Waverly \u2283 <em>x</em> =\n <em>y</em>) &amp; <em>x</em> = Scott)</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n \nIf instead, the proposition corresponding to (7) was simply a complex\nconsisting of the relation of identity, Scott, and the author of\nWaverly himself, since the author of Waverly simply <em>is</em> Scott,\nthe proposition would be the same as the uninformative proposition\n<em>Scott = Scott</em>. By showing that the actual structure of the\nproposition is quite a bit different from what it appears from the\ngrammar of the sentence \u201cThe author of Waverly = Scott\u201d, Russell\nbelieved he had shown how it might be more informative than a trivial\ninstance of the law of identity (<em>OD</em>, 51\u201354).</p>", "<p>\n \nThe theory of \u201cOn Denoting\u201d did away with Russell\u2019s temptation to\nregard grammar as a very reliable guide towards understanding the\nstructure or make-up of a proposition. Especially important in this\nregard is the notion of an \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d, by which Russell\nunderstood an expression that can be meaningful in the context of its\nuse within a sentence, but does not by itself correspond to a\nconstituent or unified part of the corresponding\nproposition. According to the theory of \u201cOn Denoting\u201d, phrases such as\n\u201cthe King of France\u201d, or \u201cthe author of Waverly\u201d were to be understood\nas \u201cincomplete symbols\u201d in this sense. The general notion of an\n\u201cincomplete symbol\u201d was applied by Russell in ways beyond the theory\nof descriptions, and perhaps most importantly, to his understanding of\nclasses.</p>", "<p>\n \nIn <em>POM</em>, Russell had postulated two types of composite\nentities: <em>unities</em> and <em>aggregates</em> (<em>POM</em>,\n140f). By a \u201cunity\u201d he meant a complex entity in which the constituent\nparts are arranged with a definite structure. A proposition was\nunderstood to be a unity in this sense.  By an \u201caggregate\u201d, he meant\nan entity such as a class whose identity conditions are governed\nentirely by what members or \u201cparts\u201d it has, and not by any\nrelationships between the parts. By the time of the publication of the\nfirst edition of <em>Principia Mathematica</em> in 1910, Russell\u2019s\nviews about both types of composite entities had changed drastically.\n</p>", "<p>\nRussell fundamentally conceived of a class as the extension of a\nconcept, or as the extension of a propositional function; indeed, in\n<em>POM</em> he claims that \u201ca class may be <em>defined</em> as all\nthe terms satisfying some propositional function\u201d (<em>POM</em>,\n20). However, Russell was aware already at the time of <em>POM</em>\nthat the supposition there is always a class, understood as an\nindividual entity, as the extension of every propositional function,\nleads to certain logical paradoxes. Perhaps the most famous, now\ncalled \u201cRussell\u2019s paradox\u201d, derived from consideration of the class,\n<em>w</em>, of all classes not members of themselves. The class\n<em>w</em> would be a member of itself if it satisfied its defining\ncondition, i.e., if it were not a member of itself. Similarly,\n<em>w</em> would not be a member of itself if it did not satisfy its\ndefining condition, i.e., if it were a member of itself.  Hence, both\nthe assumption that it is a member of itself, and the assumption that\nit is not, are impossible. Another related paradox Russell often\ndiscussed in this regard has since come to be called \u201cCantor\u2019s\nparadox\u201d. Cantor had proven that if a class had <em>n</em> members,\nthat the number of sub-classes that can be taken from that class is\n2<em><sup>n</sup></em>, and also that 2<em><sup>n</sup></em> &gt;\n<em>n</em>, even when <em>n</em> is infinite. It follows from this\nthat the number of subclasses of the class of all individuals, (i.e.,\nthe number of different classes of individuals) is greater than the\nnumber of individuals.  Russell took this as strong evidence that a\nclass of individuals could not itself be considered an\nindividual. Likewise, the number of subclasses of the class of all\nclasses is greater than the number of members in the class of all\nclasses. This Russell took to be evidence that there is some ambiguity\nin the notion of a \u201cclass\u201d so that the subclasses of the class of \u201call\nclasses\u201d would not themselves be among its members, as it would\nseem.</p>", "<p>\n \nRussell spent the years between 1902 and 1910 searching for a\nphilosophically motivated solution to such paradoxes. He tried\nsolutions of various sorts.  However, in late 1905, after the\ndiscovery of the theory of descriptions, he became convinced that an\nexpression for a class is an \u201cincomplete symbol\u201d, i.e., that while\nsuch an expression can occur as part of a meaningful sentence, it\nshould not be regarded as representing a single entity in the\ncorresponding proposition. Russell dubbed this approach the \u201cno\nclasses\u201d theory of classes (see e.g., <em>TNOT</em>, 145), because,\nwhile it allows discourse about classes to be meaningful, it does not\nposit classes as among the fundamental ontological furniture of the\nworld.  The precise nature of Russell\u2019s \u201cno classes\u201d theory underwent\nsignificant changes between 1905 and 1910. However, in the version\nadopted in the first edition of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>,\nRussell believed that a statement apparently about a class could\nalways be reconstructed, using higher-order quantification, in terms\nof a statement involving its defining propositional function. Russell\nbelieved that whenever a class term of the form\n\u201c{<em>z</em>|\u03c8<em>z</em>}\u201d appeared in some sentence, the sentence\nas a whole could be regarded as defined as follows (cf. <em>PM</em>,\n188):</p>", "<blockquote>\n \n<em>f</em>({<em>z</em>|\u03c8<em>z</em>}) \u00a0\n=<sub><em>df</em></sub> \u00a0\n(\u2203\u03c6)((<em>x</em>)(\u03c6!<em>x</em> \u2261 \u03c8<em>x</em>)\n&amp; <em>f</em>(\u03c6))\n\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n \nThe above view can be paraphrased, somewhat crudely, as the claim that\nany truth seemingly about a class can be reduced to a claim about some\nor all of its members. For example, it follows from this contextual\ndefinition of class terms that the statement to the effect that one\nclass <em>A</em> is a subset of another class <em>B</em> is equivalent\nto the claim that whatever satisfies the defining propositional\nfunction of <em>A</em> also satisfies the defining propositional\nfunction of <em>B</em>. Russell also sometimes described this as the\nview that classes are \u201clogical constructions\u201d, not part of the \u201creal\nworld\u201d, but only the world of logic. Another way Russell expressed\nhimself is by saying that a class is a \u201clogical fiction\u201d.  While it\nmay seem that a class term is representative of an entity, according\nto Russell, class terms are meaningful in a different way.  Classes\nare not among the basic stuff of the world; yet it is possible to make\nuse of class terms in significant speech, <em>as if</em> there were\nsuch things as classes. A class is thus portrayed by Russell as a mere\n<em>fa\u00e7on de parler</em>, or convenient way of speaking about\nall or some of the entities satisfying some propositional\nfunction.</p>", "<p>\n \nDuring the period in which Russell was working on <em>Principia\nMathematica</em>, most likely in 1907, Russell also radically revised\nhis former realism about propositions understood as mind independent\ncomplexes. The motivations for the change are a matter of some\ncontroversy, but there are at least two possible sources. The first is\nthat in addition to the logical paradoxes concerning the existence of\nclasses, Russell was aware of certain paradoxes stemming from the\nassumption that propositions could be understood as individual\nentities. One such paradox was discussed already in Appendix B of\n<em>POM</em> (527\u201328). By Cantor\u2019s theorem, there must be more classes\nof propositions than propositions.  However, for every class of\npropositions, <em>m</em>, it is possible to generate a distinct\nproposition, such as the proposition that <em>every proposition in m\nis true</em>, in violation of Cantor\u2019s theorem. Unlike the other\nparadoxes mentioned above, a version of this paradox can be\nreformulated even if talk of classes is replaced by talk of their\ndefining propositional functions.  Russell was also aware of certain\ncontingent paradoxes involving propositions, such as the Liar paradox\nformulated involving a person <em>S</em>, whose only assertion at time\n<em>t</em> is the proposition <em>All propositions asserted by S at\ntime t are false</em>. Given the success of the rejection of classes\nas ultimate entities in resolving the paradoxes of classes, Russell\nwas motivated to see if a similar solution to these paradoxes could be\nhad by rejecting propositions as singular entities.</p>", "<p>\n \nAnother set of considerations pushing Russell towards the rejection of\nhis former view of propositions is more straightforwardly\nmetaphysical.  According to his earlier view, and that of Moore, a\nproposition was understood as a mind independent complex. The\nconstituents of the complex are the actual entities involved, and\nhence, as we have seen, when a proposition is true, it is the same\nentity as a fact or state of affairs. However, because some\npropositions are false, this view of propositions posits objective\nfalsehoods. The false proposition that <em>Venus orbits Neptune</em>\nis thought to be a complex containing Venus and Neptune the planets,\nas well as the relation of orbiting, with the relation occurring as a\nrelation, i.e., as <em>relating</em> Venus to Neptune. However, it\nseems natural to suppose that the relation of orbiting could only\nunite Venus and Neptune into a complex, if in fact, Venus orbits\nNeptune. Hence, the presence of such objective falsehoods is itself\nout of sorts with common sense. Worse, as Russell explained, positing\nthe existence of objective falsehoods in addition to objective truths\nmakes the difference between \u201ctruth\u201d and\n\u201cfalsehood\u201d inexplicable, as both become irreducible\nproperties of propositions, and we are left without an explanation for\nthe privileged metaphysical status of truth over falsehood (see, e.g.,\n<em>NTF</em>, 152).</p>", "<p>\n \nWhatever his primary motivation, Russell abandoned any commitment to\nobjective falsehoods, and restructured his ontology of facts, and\nadopted a new correspondence theory of truth. In the terminology of\nthe new theory, the word \u201cproposition\u201d was used not for an objective\nmetaphysical complex, but simply for an interpreted declarative\nsentence, an item of language.  Propositions are thought to be true or\nfalse depending on their correspondence, or lack thereof, with\n<em>facts</em>. </p>", "<p>\n \nIn the Introduction to <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, as part of his\nexplanation of ramified type-theory, Russell described various notions\nof truth applicable to different types of propositions of different\ncomplexity. The simplest propositions in the language of <em>Principia\nMathematica</em> are what Russell there called \u201celementary\npropositions\u201d, which take forms such as \u201c<em>a</em> has quality\n<em>q</em>\u201d, \u201c<em>a</em> has relation [in intension] <em>R</em> to\n<em>b</em>\u201d, or \u201c<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> and <em>c</em> stand in\nrelation <em>S</em>\u201d (<em>PM</em>, 43\u201344). Such propositions\nconsist of a simple predicate, representing either a quality or a\nrelation, and a number of proper names. According to Russell, such a\nproposition is true when there is a corresponding fact or complex,\ncomposed of the entities named by the predicate and proper names\nrelated to each other in the appropriate way. E.g., the proposition\n\u201c<em>a</em> has relation <em>R</em> to <em>b</em>\u201d is true if there\nexists a corresponding complex in which the entity <em>a</em> is\nrelated by the relation <em>R</em> to the entity <em>b</em>. If there\nis no corresponding complex, then the proposition is false.</p>", "<p>\n \nRussell dubbed the notion of truth applicable to elementary\npropositions \u201cfirst truth\u201d. This notion of truth serves as\nthe ground for a hierarchy of different notions of truth applicable to\ndifferent types of propositions depending on their complexity. A\nproposition such as \u201c(<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em> has\nquality <em>q</em>)\u201d which involves a first-order quantifier,\nhas (or lacks) \u201csecond truth\u201d depending on whether its\ninstances have \u201cfirst truth\u201d. In this case,\n\u201c(<em>x</em>)(<em>x</em> has quality <em>q</em>)\u201d would be\ntrue if every proposition got by replacing the\n\u201c<em>x</em>\u201d in \u201c<em>x</em> has\nquality <em>q</em>\u201d with the proper name of an individual has\n\u201cfirst truth\u201d (<em>PM</em>, 42). A proposition involving\nthe simplest kind of second-order quantifier, i.e., a quantifier using\na variable for \u201cpredicative\u201d propositional functions of\nthe lowest type, would have or lack \u201cthird truth\u201d\ndepending on whether its allowable substitution instances have second\n(or lower) truth.  Because any statement apparently about a class of\nindividuals involves this sort of higher-order quantification, the\ntruth or falsity of such a proposition will ultimately depend on the\ntruth or falsity of various elementary propositions about its\nmembers. </p>", "<p>\n \nAlthough Russell did not use the phrase \u201clogical atomism\u201d in the\nIntroduction to <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, in many ways it\nrepresents the first work of Russell\u2019s atomist period. Russell there\nexplicitly endorsed the view that the \u201cuniverse consists of objects\nhaving various qualities and standing in various relations\u201d\n(<em>PM</em>, 43).  Propositions that assert that an object has a\nquality, or that multiple objects stand in a certain relation, were\ngiven a privileged place in the theory, and explanation was given as\nto how more complicated truths, including truths about classes, depend\non the truth of such simple propositions. Russell\u2019s work over the next\ntwo decades consisted largely in refining and expanding upon this\npicture of the world.</p>", "<p>\n Although Russell changed his mind on a great number of philosophical\nissues throughout his career, one of the most stable elements in his\nviews is the endorsement of a certain methodology for approaching\nphilosophy. Indeed, it could be argued to be the most continuous and\nunifying feature of Russell\u2019s philosophical work (e.g., see Hager\n1994).  Russell employed the methodology self-consciously, and gave\nonly slightly differing descriptions of this methodology in works\nthroughout his career (see, esp., <em>EFG</em>,\n14\u201315; <em>POM</em>, 1\u20132, 129\u201330; <em>RMDP</em>,\n272\u201374; <em>PM</em>, 59; <em>IPL</em>,\n284\u201385; <em>TK</em>, 33, 158\u201359; <em>OKEW</em>,\n144\u201345; <em>PLA</em>, 178\u201382, 270\u201371; <em>IMP</em>,\n1\u20132; <em>LA</em>, 324\u201336, 341;\n<em>RTC</em>, 687; <em>HWP</em>, 788\u201389; <em>HK</em>, 257\u201359;\n<em>MPD</em>, 98\u201399, 162\u2013163). Understanding this methodology is\nparticularly important for understanding his logical atomism, as well\nas what he meant by \u201canalysis\u201d.</p>", "<p>\n The methodology consists of a two phase process. The first phase is\ndubbed the \u201canalytic\u201d phase (although it should be noted that\nsometimes Russell used the word \u201canalysis\u201d for the whole\nprocedure). One begins with a certain theory, doctrine or collection\nof beliefs which is taken to be more or less correct, but is taken to\nbe in certain regards vague, imprecise, disunified, overly complex or\nin some other way confused or puzzling. The aim in the first phase is\nto work backwards from these beliefs, taken as a kind of \u201cdata\u201d, to a\ncertain minimal stock of undefined concepts and general principles\nwhich might be thought to underlie the original body of knowledge. The\nsecond phase, which Russell described as the \u201cconstructive\u201d or\n\u201csynthetic\u201d phase, consists in rebuilding or reconstructing the\noriginal body of knowledge in terms of the results of the first phase.\nMore specifically, in the synthetic phase, one defines those elements\nof the original conceptual framework and vocabulary of the discipline\nin terms of the \u201cminimum vocabulary\u201d identified in the first phrase,\nand derives or deduces the main tenets of the original theory from the\nbasic principles or general truths one arrives at after analysis. </p>", "<p>\n \nAs a result of such a process, the system of beliefs with which one\nbegan takes on a new form in which connections between various\nconcepts it uses are made clear, the logical interrelations between\nvarious theses of the theory are clarified, and vague or unclear\naspects of the original terminology are eliminated.  Moreover, the\nprocedure also provides opportunities for the application of Occam\u2019s\nrazor, as it calls for the elimination of unnecessary or redundant\naspects of a theory. Concepts or assumptions giving rise to paradoxes\nor conundrums or other problems within a theory are often found to be\nwholly unnecessary or capable of being supplanted by something less\nproblematic.  Another advantage is that the procedure arranges its\nresults as a deductive system, and hence invites and facilitates the\ndiscovery of new results.\n</p>", "<p>\n \nExamples of this general procedure can be found throughout Russell\u2019s\nwritings, and Russell also credits others with having achieved similar\nsuccesses.  Russell\u2019s work in mathematical logic provides perhaps the\nmost obvious example of his utilization of such a procedure. It is\nalso an excellent example of Russell\u2019s contention that analysis\nproceeds in stages. Russell saw his own work as the next step in a\nseries of successes beginning with the work of Cantor, Dedekind and\nWeierstrass. Prior to the work of these figures, mathematics employed\na number of concepts, <em>number</em>, <em>magnitude</em>, <em>series,\nlimit</em>, <em>infinity</em>, <em>function, continuity</em>, etc.,\nwithout a full understanding of the precise definition of each\nconcept, nor how they related to one another. By introducing precise\ndefinitions of such notions, these thinkers exposed ambiguities (e.g.,\nsuch as with the word \u201cinfinite\u201d), revealed interrelations between\ncertain of them, and eliminated dubious notions that had previously\ncaused confusion and paradoxes (such as those involved with the notion\nof an \u201cinfinitesimal\u201d). Russell saw the next step forward in the\nanalysis of mathematics in the work of Peano and his associates, who\nnot only attempted to explain how many mathematical notions could be\n\u201carithmetized\u201d, i.e., defined and proven in terms of arithmetic, but\nhad also identified, in the case of arithmetic, three basic concepts\n(<em>zero</em>, <em>successor</em>, and <em>natural number</em>) and\nfive basic principles (the so-called \u201cPeano axioms\u201d), from which the\nrest of arithmetic was thought to be derivable.</p>", "<p>\n \nRussell described the next advance as taking place in the work of\nFrege. According to the conception of number found in Frege\u2019s\n<em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em>, a number can be regarded as an\nequivalence class consisting of those classes whose members can be put\nin 1-1 correspondence with any other member of the class. According to\nRussell, this conception allowed the primitives of Peano\u2019s analysis to\nbe defined fully in terms of the notion of a class, along with other\nlogical notions such as identity, quantification, negation and the\nconditional. Similarly, Frege\u2019s work showed how the basic principles\nof Peano\u2019s analysis could be derived from logical axioms\nalone. However, Frege\u2019s analysis was not in all ways successful, as\nthe notion of a class or the extension of a concept which Frege\nincluded as a logically primitive notion lead to certain\ncontradictions. In this regard, Russell saw his own analysis of\nmathematics (largely developed independently from Frege) as an\nimprovement, with its more austere analysis that eliminates even the\nnotion of a class as a primitive idea (see the discussion of classes\nin Section 2.4 above), and thereby eliminates the contradictions (see,\ne.g., <em>RMDP</em>, 276\u201381; <em>LA</em>, 325\u201327).</p>", "<p>\n \nIt was clearly a part of Russell\u2019s view that in conducting an\nanalysis of a domain such as mathematics, and reducing its primitive\nconceptual apparatus and unproven premises to a minimum, one is not\nmerely reducing the vocabulary of a certain theory, but also showing a\nway of reducing the metaphysical commitments of the theory. In first\nshowing that numbers such as 1, 2, etc., could be defined in terms of\nclasses of like cardinality, and then showing how apparent discourse\nabout \u201cclasses\u201d could be replaced by higher-order\nquantification, Russell made it possible to see how it is that there\ncould be truths of arithmetic without presupposing that the numbers\nconstitute a special category of abstract entity. Numbers are placed\nin the category of \u201clogical fictions\u201d or \u201clogical\nconstructions\u201d along with all other classes.</p>", "<p>\n \nRussell\u2019s work from the period after the publication of <em>Principia\nMathematica</em> of 1910 shows applications of this general\nphilosophical approach to non-mathematical domains. In particular, his\nwork over the next two decades shows concern with the attempt to provide\nanalyses of the notions of knowledge, space, time, experience, matter\nand causation. When Russell applied his analytic methodology to\nsciences such as physics, again the goal was to arrive at a\n\u201cminimum vocabulary\u201d required for the science in question,\nas well as a set of basic premises and general truths from which the\nrest of the science can be derived. We cannot delve into all the\ndetails of Russell\u2019s evolving analyses here. However, according to the\nviews developed by Russell in the mid-1910s, many of the fundamental\nnotions in physics were thought to be analyzable in terms of\nparticular sensations: i.e., bits of color, auditory notes, or other\nsimple parts of sensation, and their qualities and relations. Russell\ncalled such sensations, when actually experienced,\n\u201csense\u201d. In particular, Russell believed that the notion\nof a \u201cphysical thing\u201d could be replaced, or analyzed in\nterms of, the notion of a series of classes of sensible particulars\neach bearing to one another certain relations of continuity,\nresemblance, and perhaps certain other relations relevant to the\nformulation of the laws of physics (<em>OKEW</em>, 86ff;\n<em>RSDP</em>, 114\u201315; <em>UCM</em>, 105). Other physical\nnotions such as that of a point of space, or an instance of time,\ncould be conceived in terms of classes of sensible particulars and\ntheir spatial and temporal relations (see <em>TK</em>,\n77; <em>OKEW</em>, 91\u201399). Later, after abandoning the view that\nperception is fundamentally relational, and accepting a form of\nWilliam James\u2019s neutral monism, Russell similarly came to believe that\nthe notion of a conscious mind could be analyzed in terms of various\npercepts, experiences and sensations related to each other by\npsychological laws (<em>AMi</em> chaps. 1, 5; <em>OOP</em> chap.  26;\ncf. <em>PLA</em>, 277ff). Hence, Russell came to the view that words\nas \u201cpoint\u201d, \u201cmatter\u201d,\u201cinstant\u201d,\n\u201cmind\u201d, and the like could be discarded from the minimum\nvocabulary needed for physics or psychology. Instead, such words could\nbe systematically translated into a language only containing words\nrepresenting certain qualities and relations between sensible\nparticulars.</p>", "<p>\n \nThroughout these analyses, Russell put into practice a slogan he\nstated as follows: \u201cWherever possible, logical constructions are\nto be substituted for inferred entities\u201d (<em>RSDP</em>, 115;\ncf. <em>LA</em>, 326). Rival philosophies that postulate an\n<em>ego</em> or <em>mind</em> as an entity distinct from its mental\nstates involve inferring the existence of an entity that cannot\ndirectly be found in experience. Something similar can be said about\nphilosophies that take matter to be an entity distinct from sensible\nappearances, lying behind them and inferred from them. Combining\nRussell\u2019s suggestions that talk of \u201cminds\u201d or \u201cphysical objects\u201d is to\nbe analyzed in terms of classes of sensible particulars with his\ngeneral view that classes are \u201clogical fictions\u201d, results in the view\nthat minds and physical objects too are \u201clogical fictions\u201d, or not\nparts of the basic building blocks of reality. Instead, all truths\nabout such purported entities turn out instead to be analyzable as\ntruths about sensible particulars and their relations to one\nanother. This is in keeping with the general metaphysical outlook of\nlogical atomism. We also have here a fairly severe application of\nOccam\u2019s razor. The slogan was applied within his analyses in\nmathematics as well. Noting that sometimes a series of rational\nnumbers converges towards a limit which is not itself specifiable as a\nrational, some philosophers of mathematics thought that one should\n<em>postulate</em> an irrational number as a limit. Russell claimed\nthat rather than <em>postulating</em> entities in such a case, an\nirrational number should simply be <em>defined</em> as a class of\nrational numbers without a rational upper bound. Russell preferred to\nreconstruct talk of irrationals this way rather than <em>infer</em> or\n<em>postulate</em> the existence of a new species of mathematical\nentity not already known to exist, complaining that the method of\n\u201cpostulating\u201d what we want has \u201cthe advantages of theft over honest\ntoil\u201d (<em>IMP</em>, 71).</p>", "<p>\n \nIn conducting an analysis of mathematics, or indeed, of any other\ndomain of thought, Russell was clear that although the results of\nanalysis can be regarded as <em>logical</em> premises from which the\noriginal body of knowledge can in principle be derived,\nepistemologically speaking, the pre-analyzed beliefs are more\nfundamental. For example, in mathematics, a belief such as \u201c2 + 2 = 4\u201d\nis epistemologically more certain, and psychologically easier to\nunderstand and accept, than many of the logical premises from which it\nis derived. Indeed, Russell believed that the results obtained through\nthe process of analysis obtain their epistemic warrant inductively\nfrom the evident truth of their logical consequences (see, e.g.,\n<em>TK</em>, 158\u201359). As Russell put it, \u201c[t]he reason for\naccepting an axiom, as for accepting any other proposition, is always\nlargely inductive, namely that many propositions which are nearly\nindubitable can be deduced from it, and that no equally plausible way\nis known by which these propositions could be true if the axiom were\nfalse, and nothing which is plausibly false can be deduced from it\u201d\n(<em>PM</em>, 59; cf. <em>RMDP</em>, 282). It is perhaps for these\nreasons that Russell believed that the process of philosophical\nanalysis should always begin with beliefs the truth of which are not\nin question, i.e., which are \u201cnearly indubitable\u201d. </p>", "<p>\n \nWhen Russell spoke about the general philosophical methodology\ndescribed here, he usually had in mind applying the process of\nanalysis to an entire body of knowledge or set of data. In fact,\nRussell advocated usually to begin with the uncontroversial doctrine\nof a certain science, such as mathematics or physics, largely because\nhe held that these theories are the most likely to be true, or at\nleast nearly true, and hence make the most appropriate place to begin\nthe process of analysis. </p>", "<p>\n \nRussell did on occasion also speak of analyzing a particular\nproposition of ordinary life. One example he gave is \u201cThere are a\nnumber of people in this room at this moment\u201d (<em>PLA</em>, 179). In\nthis case, the truth or falsity of this statement may seem obvious,\nbut exactly what its truth would involve is rather obscure. The\nprocess of analysis in this case would consist in attempting to make\nthe proposition clear by defining what it is for something to be a\nroom, for something to be a person, for a person to be in a room, what\na moment is, etc. In this case, it might seem that the ordinary\nlanguage statement is sufficiently vague that there is likely no\n<em>one</em> precise or unambiguous proposition that represents the\n\u201ccorrect analysis\u201d of the proposition. In a sense this is right;\nhowever, this does not mean that analysis would be worthless. Russell\nwas explicit that the goal of analysis is not to unpack what is\npsychologically intended by an ordinary statement such as the previous\nexample, nor what a person would be thinking when he or she utters\nit. The point rather is simply to begin with a certain obvious, but\nrough and vague statement, and find a replacement for it in a more\nprecise, unified, and minimal idiom (see, e.g., <em>PLA</em>, 180,\n189). </p>", "<p>\n On Russell\u2019s view, vagueness is a feature of language, not of the\nworld. In vague language, there is no one-one relation between\npropositions and facts, so that a vague statement could be considered\nverified by any one of a range of different facts (<em>Vag</em>,\n217). However, in a properly analyzed proposition, there is a clear\nisomorphism between the structure of the proposition and the structure\nof the fact that would make it true (<em>PLA</em>, 197); hence a\nprecise and analyzed proposition is capable of being true in one and\nonly one way (<em>Vag</em>, 219). In analyzing a proposition such as\n\u201cthere are a number of people in this room at this moment\u201d, one might\nobtain a precise statement which would require for its truth that\nthere is a certain class of sensible particulars related to each other\nin a very definite way constituting the presence of a room, and\ncertain other classes of sensible particulars related to each other in\nways constituting people, and that the sensible particulars in the\nlatter classes bear certain definite relations to those in the first\nclass of particulars.  Obviously, nothing like this is clearly in the\nmind of a person who would ordinarily use the original English\nexpression. It is clear to see in this case that a very specific state\nof things is required for the truth of the analyzed proposition, and\nhence the truth of it will be far more doubtful than the truth of the\nvague assertion with which one began the process (<em>PLA</em>,\n179\u201380). As Russell put the point, \u201cthe point of philosophy is to\nstart with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to\nend with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it\u201d\n(<em>PLA</em>, 193). </p>", "<p>\n As we have seen, the primary metaphysical thesis of Russell\u2019s atomism\nis the view that the world consists of many independent entities that\nexhibit qualities and stand in relations to one another.  On this\npicture, the simplest sort of fact or complex consists either of a\nsingle individual or particular bearing a quality, or a number of\nindividuals bearing a relation to one another. Relations can be\ndivided into various categories depending on how many relata they\ninvolve: a <em>binary</em> or <em>dyadic</em> relation involves two\nrelata (e.g., <em>a</em> is to the left of <em>b</em>); a\n<em>triadic</em> relation (e.g., <em>a</em> is between <em>b</em> and\n<em>c</em>) involves three relata and so on. Russell at times used the\nword \u201crelation\u201d in a broad sense so as to include qualities, which\ncould be considered as \u201cmonadic\u201d relations, i.e., relations that only\ninvolve one relatum.  The quality of <em>being white</em>, involved,\ne.g., in the fact that <em>a</em> is white, could then, in this\nbroader sense, also be considered a relation.</p>", "<p>\n \nAt the time of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, complexes in Russell\u2019s\nontology were all described as taking the form of <em>n</em>\nindividuals entering into an <em>n</em>-adic relation. There he\nwrites:</p>", "<blockquote>We will give the name of \u201ca complex\u201d to any such object as\n\u201c<em>a</em> in the relation <em>R</em> to <em>b</em>\u201d or \u201c<em>a</em>\nhaving the quality <em>q</em>,\u201d or \u201c<em>a</em> and <em>b</em> and\n<em>c</em> standing in relation <em>S</em>.\u201d Broadly speaking, a\ncomplex is anything which occurs in the universe and is not\nsimple. (<em>PM</em>, 44)</blockquote>", "<p>\n As we have seen, at the time of writing <em>Principia\nMathematica</em>, Russell believed that an elementary proposition\nconsisting of a single predicate representing an <em>n</em>-place\nrelation along with <em>n</em> names of individuals is true if it\ncorresponds to a complex. An elementary proposition is false if there\nis no corresponding complex. Russell there gave no indication that he\nbelieved in any other sorts of complexes or truth-makers for any other\nsorts of propositions. Indeed, he held that a quantified proposition\nis made true not by a single complex, but by many, writing, \u201c[i]f\n\u03c6<em>x</em> is an elementary judgment it is true when it\n<em>points to</em> a corresponding complex. But\n(<em>x</em>).\u03c6<em>x</em> does not point to a single corresponding\ncomplex: the corresponding complexes are as numerous as the possible\nvalues of <em>x</em>\u201d (<em>PM</em>, 46).</p>", "<p>\n \nSoon after <em>Principia Mathematica</em>, Russell became convinced\nthat this picture was too simplistic. In the \u201cPhilosophy of Logical\nAtomism\u201d lectures he described a more complicated framework. In the\nnew terminology, the phrase \u201catomic fact\u201d was introduced for the\nsimplest kind of fact, i.e., one in which <em>n</em> particulars enter\ninto an <em>n</em>-adic relation.  He used the phrase \u201catomic\nproposition\u201d for a proposition consisting only of a predicate for an\n<em>n</em>-place relation, along with <em>n</em> proper names for\nparticulars. Hence, such propositions could take such forms as\n\u201c<em>F</em>(<em>a</em>)\u201d,\n\u201c<em>R</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)\u201d,\n\u201c<em>S</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>)\u201d\n(cf. <em>PM2</em>, xv).  An atomic proposition is true when it\ncorresponds to a positive atomic fact. However, Russell no longer\nconceived of falsity as simply <em>lacking</em> a corresponding\nfact. Russell now believed that some facts are negative, i.e., that if\n\u201c<em>R</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)\u201d is false, there is\nsuch a fact as\n<em>a</em>\u2019s<em> not</em> bearing relation <em>R</em> to <em>b</em>.\nSince the proposition \u201c<em>R</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)\u201d is\naffirmative, and the corresponding fact is negative,\n\u201c<em>R</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)\u201d is false, and, equivalently, its\nnegation \u201cnot-<em>R</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)\u201d is true. Russell\u2019s\nrationale for endorsing negative facts was somewhat complicated (see,\ne.g., <em>PLA</em>, 211\u201315); however, one might object that his\nearlier view, according to which \u201c<em>R</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)\u201d\nis false because it lacks a corresponding complex, is only plausible\nif you suppose that it must be a <em>fact</em> that there is not such\na complex, and such a fact would itself seem to be a negative\nfact.</p>", "<p>\n \nBy 1918, Russell had also abandoned the view, held at least as late as\n1911 (see <em>RA</em>, 94) that qualities and relations can occur in a\ncomplex as themselves the <em>relata</em> to another relation, as in\n\u201cpriority implies diversity\u201d. Partly influenced by Wittgenstein,\nRussell now held the view that whenever a proposition apparently\ninvolves a relation or quality occurring as logical subject, it is\ncapable of being analyzed into a form in which the relation or quality\noccurs predicatively. For example, \u201cpriority implies diversity\u201d might\nbe analyzed as \u201c(<em>x</em>)(<em>y</em>)(<em>x</em> is prior to\n<em>y</em> \u2283 <em>x</em> is not <em>y</em>)\u201d (<em>PLA</em>, 205\u201306;\nfor further discussion see Klement 2004).</p>", "<p>\n \nRussell used the phrase \u201cmolecular proposition\u201d for those propositions\nthat are compounded using truth-function operators.  Examples would\ninclude, \u201c<em>F</em>(<em>a</em>) &amp;\n<em>R</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)\u201d and\n\u201c<em>R</em>(<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>)\n\u2228 <em>R</em>(<em>b</em>, <em>a</em>)\u201d. According to Russell,\nit is unnecessary to suppose that there exists any special sort of\nfact corresponding to molecular propositions; the truth-value of a\nmolecular proposition could be entirely derivative on the truth-values\nof its constituents (<em>PLA</em>, 209). Hence, if\n\u201c<em>F</em>(<em>a</em>)\n&amp; <em>R</em>(<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>)\u201d is true, ultimately it\nis made true by two atomic facts, the fact that\n<em>a</em> has property <em>F</em> and the fact that <em>a</em> bears\n<em>R</em> to <em>b</em>, and not by a single conjunctive fact.</p>", "<p>\n \nHowever, by 1918, Russell\u2019s attitude with regard to quantified\npropositions had changed. He no longer believed that the truth of a\ngeneral proposition could be reduced simply to the facts or complexes\nmaking its instances true.  Russell argued that the truth of the\ngeneral proposition \u201c(<em>x</em>).<em>R</em>(<em>x</em>,  <em>b</em>)\u201d\ncould not consist entirely of the various atomic facts that <em>a</em>\nbears <em>R</em> to <em>b</em>, <em>b</em> bears <em>R</em> to\n<em>b</em>, <em>c</em> bears <em>R</em> to <em>b</em>,\u00a0\u2026. It\nalso requires the truth that there are no other individuals besides\n<em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>c</em>, etc., i.e., no other atomic facts\nof the relevant form. Hence, Russell concluded that there is a special\ncategory of facts he calls <em>general facts</em> that account for the\ntruth of quantified propositions, although he admitted a certain\namount of uncertainty as to their precise nature (<em>PLA</em>,\n234\u201337). Likewise, Russell also posited <em>existence facts</em>,\nthose facts corresponding to the truth of existentially quantified\npropositions, such as\n\u201c(\u2203<em>x</em>)<em>R</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>b</em>)\u201d. In the case of\ngeneral and existence facts, Russell did not think it coherent to make\ndistinctions between positive and negative facts. Indeed, a negative\ngeneral fact could simply be described as an existence fact, and a\nnegative existence fact could be described as a general fact. For\nexample, the falsity of the general proposition \u201call birds fly\u201d\namounts to the fact that there exist birds that do not fly, and the\nfalsity of the existential proposition \u201cthere are unicorns\u201d amounts to\nthe general fact that everything is not a unicorn. Obviously, however,\nthe truth or falsity of a general or existence proposition is not\nwholly independent of its instances.</p>", "<p>\n \nIn addition to the sorts of facts discussed above, Russell raised the\nquestion as to whether a special sort of fact is required\ncorresponding to propositions that report a belief, desire or other\n\u201cpropositional attitude\u201d.  Russell\u2019s views on this matter changed over\ndifferent periods, as his own views regarding the nature of judgment,\nbelief and representation matured.  Moreover, in some works he left it\nas an open question as to whether one need presuppose a distinct kind\nof logical form in these cases (e.g.,<em> PLA</em>, 224\u201328;\n<em>IMT</em>, 256\u201357). At times, however, Russell believed that the\nfact that <em>S</em> believes that <em>a</em> bears <em>R</em> to\n<em>b</em> amounts to the holding of a multiple relation in which\n<em>S</em>, <em>a</em>, <em>R</em> and <em>b</em> are all\nrelata (e.g. <em>NTF</em>, 155\u201356; <em>TK</em>, 144ff).  At other\npoints, he considered more complicated analyses in which beliefs\namount to the possession of certain psychological states bearing\ncausal or other relationships to the objects they are about, or the\ntendencies of believers to behave in certain ways (see, e.g.,\n<em>IMT</em>, 182\u201383; <em>HK</em>, 144\u201348).  Depending on how such\nphenomena are analyzed, it is certainly not clear that they require\nany new species of fact. </p>", "<p>\n \nRussell\u2019s use of the phrase \u201catomic fact\u201d, and indeed the very title\nof \u201clogical atomism\u201d suggest that the constituents of atomic facts,\nthe \u201clogical atoms\u201d, Russell spoke of, must be regarded as utterly\nsimple and devoid of complexity. In that case, the particulars,\nqualities and relations making up atomic facts constitute the\nfundamental level of reality to which all other aspects of reality are\nultimately reducible. This attitude is confirmed especially in\nRussell\u2019s early logical atomist writings. For example, in \u201cAnalytic\nRealism\u201d, Russell wrote:\n</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n\u2026 the philosophy I espouse is <em>analytic</em>,\nbecause it claims that one must discover the simple elements of which\ncomplexes are composed, and that complexes presuppose simples, whereas\nsimples do not presuppose complexes \u2026 \n\n<p>\n I believe there are simple beings in the universe, and that these\nbeings have relations in virtue of which complex beings are\ncomposed. Any time <em>a</em> bears the relation <em>R</em> to\n<em>b</em> there is a complex \u201c<em>a</em> in relation <em>R</em> to\n<em>b</em>\u201d \u2026 </p>\n\n<p>\n You will note that this philosophy is the philosophy of logical\natomism. Every simple entity is an atom. (<em>RA</em>,  94)</p>\n\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n \nElsewhere he spoke of \u201clogical atomism\u201d as involving the\nview that \u201cyou can get down in theory, if not in practice, to\nultimate simples, out of which the world is built, and that those\nsimples have a kind of reality not belonging to anything else\u201d\n(<em>PLA</em>, 270). However, it has been questioned whether Russell\nhad sufficient argumentation for thinking that there are such simple\nbeings.</p>", "<p>\n \nIn the abstract, there are two sorts of arguments Russell could have\ngiven for the existence of simples, <em>a priori</em> arguments, or\nempirical arguments (cf. Pears 1985, 4ff). An <em>a priori</em>\nargument might proceed from the very understanding of complexity: what\nis complex presupposes parts. In 1924, Russell wrote, \u201cI confess it\nseems obvious to me (as it did Leibniz) that what is complex must be\ncomposed of simples, though the number of constituents may be\ninfinite\u201d (<em>LA</em>, 337). However, if construed as an argument,\nthis does not seem very convincing. It seems at least logically\npossible that while a complex may have parts, its parts might\nthemselves be complex, and their parts might also be complex, and\nso on, <em>ad infinitum</em>.  Indeed, Russell himself later came to\nadmit that one could not know simply on the basis of something being\ncomplex that it must be composed of simples (<em>MPD</em>, 123).</p>", "<p>\n \nAnother sort of <em>a priori</em> argument might stem from conceptions\nregarding the nature of <em>analysis</em>. As analysis proceeds, one\nreaches more primitive notions, and it might be thought that the\nprocess must terminate at a stage in which the remaining vocabulary is\nindefinable because the entities involved are absolutely simple, and\nhence, cannot be construed as logical constructions built out of\nanything more primitive. Russell did at some points describe his\nlogical atoms as reached at \u201cthe limit of analysis\u201d (<em>LA</em>, 337)\nor \u201cthe final residue in analysis\u201d (<em>MPD</em>, 164). However, even\nduring the height of his logical atomist period, Russell admitted that\nit is possible that \u201canalysis could go on forever\u201d, and that complex\nthings might be capable of analysis \u201c<em>ad infinitum</em>\u201d\n(<em>PLA</em>, 202).</p>", "<p>\n \nLastly, one might argue for simples as the basis of an empirical\nargument; i.e., one might claim to have completed the process of\nanalysis and to have reduced all sorts of truths down to certain\nentities that can be known in some way or another to be\nsimple. Russell is sometimes interpreted as having reasoned in this\nway. According to Russell\u2019s well known \u201cprinciple of acquaintance\u201d in\nepistemology, in order to understand a proposition, one must be\nacquainted with the meaning of every simple symbol making it up (see,\ne.g., <em>KAKD</em>, 159).  Russell at times suggested that we are\nonly directly acquainted with sense data, and their properties and\nrelations, and perhaps with our own selves (<em>KAKD</em>, 154ff). It\nmight be thought that these entities are simple, and must constitute\nthe terminus of analysis. However, Russell was explicit that\nsense data can themselves be complex, and that he knew of no reason to\nsuppose that we cannot be acquainted with a complex without being\naware that it is complex and without being acquainted with its\nconstituents (<em>KAKD</em>, 153; cf. <em>TK</em>, 120). Moreover, Russell continued to use the label \u201clogical atomism\u201d to describe his philosophy long after his epistemology had ceased to center around the acquaintance relation. (For further argumentation on these points, see Elkind 2018.) Indeed,\nRussell eventually came to the conclusion that nothing can ever be\n<em>known</em> to be simple (<em>MPD</em>, 123).</p>", "<p>\n \nWhile there is significant evidence that Russell did believe in the\nexistence of simple entities in the early phases of his logical\natomist period, it is possible that, uncharacteristically, he held\nthis belief without argumentation.  In admitting that it is possible\nthat analysis could go on <em>ad infinitum</em>, Russell claimed that\n\u201cI do not think it is true, but it is a thing that one might argue,\ncertainly\u201d (<em>PLA</em>, 202). In his 1924 piece \u201cLogical Atomism\u201d,\nRussell admitted that \u201cby greater logical skill, the need for assuming\nthem [i.e. simples] could be avoided\u201d.  This attitude may explain in\npart why it is that at the outset of his 1918 lectures on logical atomism,\nhe claimed that \u201c[t]he things I am going to say in these lectures are\nmainly my own personal opinions and I do not claim that they are more\nthan that\u201d (<em>PLA</em>, 178). It may have been that Russell was\ninterested not so much in establishing definitively that there are any\nabsolutely simple entities, but rather in combating the widespread\narguments of others that the notion of a simple, independent entity is\nincoherent, and only the whole of the universe is fundamentally\nreal. According to Russell, such attitudes are customarily traced to a\nwrong view about relations; in arguing for the doctrine of \u201cexternal\nrelations\u201d, Russell was attempting simply to render a world of simple\nentities coherent again. Others had argued that possessing an inner complexity in the form of \u201cnature\u201d was needed to explain the essential properties of things or the necessary connections between them; as we shall see in Section 4.3 below, Russell believed that such apparent essential properties or necessary relations could typically be explained away.</p>", "<p>\n As his career progressed, Russell became more and more prone to\nemphasize that what is important for his philosophical outlook\nis not absolute simplicity, but only <em>relative</em> simplicity. As\nearly as 1922, in response to criticism about his notion of\nsimplicity, Russell wrote:</p>", "<blockquote>\n As for \u201cabstract analysis in search of the \u2018simple\u2019 and\nelemental\u201d, that is a more important matter.  To begin with, \u201csimple\u201d\nmust not be taken in an absolute sense; \u201csimpler\u201d would be a better\nword. Of course, I should be glad to reach the absolutely simple, but\nI do not believe that that is within human capacity. What I do\nmaintain is that, whenever anything is complex, out knowledge is\nadvanced by discovering constituents of it, even if these constituents\nthemselves are still complex. (<em>SA</em>, 40)</blockquote>", "<p>\n According to Russell, analysis proceeds in stages.  When analysis\nshows the terminology and presuppositions of one stage of analysis to\nbe definable, or logically constructible, in terms of simpler and more\nbasic notions, this is a philosophical advance, even if these notions\nare themselves further analyzable. As Russell says, the only drawback\nto a language which is not yet <em>fully</em> analyzed is that in it,\none cannot speak of anything more fundamental than those objects,\nproperties or relations that are named at that level (e.g.,\n<em>LA</em>, 337).</p>", "<p>\n \nIn a later work, Russell summarized his position as follows:</p>", "<blockquote>\n If the world is composed of simples\u2014i.e., of things, qualities and\nrelations that are devoid of structure\u2014then not only all our\nknowledge but all that of Omniscience could be expressed by means of\nwords denoting these simples. We could distinguish in the world a\nstuff (to use William James\u2019s word) and a structure. The stuff would\nconsist of all the simples denoted by names, while the structure would\ndepend on relations and qualities for which our minimum vocabulary\nwould have words.\n\n<p> \n This conception can be applied without assuming that there is anything\nabsolutely simple. We can define as \u201crelatively simple\u201d whatever we do\nnot know to be complex. Results obtained using the concept of\n\u201crelative simplicity\u201d will still be true if complexity is afterward\nfound, provided we have abstained from asserting absolute simplicity\n(<em>HK</em>, 259)</p>\n </blockquote>", "<p>\n  Russell concluded that even if there are no ultimate simples, no\nfundamental layer of reality that analysis can in principle reach,\nthis does not invalidate analysis as a philosophical\nprocedure. Moreover, at a given stage of analysis, a certain class of\nsentences may still be labeled as \u201catomic\u201d, even if the facts\ncorresponding to them cannot be regarded as built of fundamental\nontological atoms (<em>MPD</em>, 165). Russell concluded that \u201cthe\nwhole question whether there are simples to be reached by analysis is\nunnecessary\u201d (<em>MPD</em>, 123).  From this vantage point, it might\nbe argued that Russell\u2019s \u201clogical atomism\u201d can be understood as first\nand foremost a commitment to analysis as a method coupled with a\nrejection of idealistic monism, rather than a pretense to have\ndiscovered the genuine metaphysical \u201catoms\u201d making up the world of\nfacts, or even the belief that such a discovery is possible\n(cf. Linsky 2003; Maclean 2018). Indeed, Russell continued to use the phrase\n\u201clogical atomism\u201d to describe his philosophy in later years of his\ncareer, during the period in which he stressed relative, not absolute\nsimplicity (<em>RTC</em>, 717; <em>MPD</em>, 9).</p>", "<p>\n \nAnother important issue often discussed in connection with logical\natomism worth discussing in greater detail is the supposition that\natomic propositions are logically independent of each other, or that\nthe truth or falsity of any one atomic proposition does not logically\nimply or necessitate the truth or falsity of any other atomic\nproposition. This supposition is often taken to be a central aspect of\nthe very notion of \u201clogical atomism\u201d, perhaps largely because it is\nfound explicitly in Wittgenstein\u2019s <em>Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus</em>, almost certainly the most important account\nof a logical atomist philosophy found outside of Russell\u2019s\nwork. Wittgenstein claimed:\n</p>", "<blockquote>\n 4.211\u00a0\u00a0 It is a sign of a proposition\u2019s being elementary\nthat there can be no elementary proposition contradicting\nit. (Wittgenstein 1922, 89)\n\n<p>\n \n5.134\u00a0\u00a0 From an elementary proposition no other can be\ninferred.  (Wittgenstein 1922, 109)</p>\n\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n The lack of any logical relations between atomic propositions goes\nhand in hand with a similar view about atomic <em>facts</em>; each\natomic fact is metaphysically independent of every other, and any one\ncould obtain or fail to obtain regardless of the obtaining (or not) of\nany other.</p>", "<p>This position also pairs well with a broader view on the nature of necessity: that all necessity reduces to features of logical form. There is nothing in the <em>form</em> of one atomic statement that would allow us to infer (or reject) another. Hence, if all necessary connections are a result of logical form, atomic facts must be independent. If what appears to be a simple subject-predicate statement is necessary, it must in fact have a more complicated form when analyzed, so that the necessity of the statement is explained by its form. Similar remarks might be suggested what appear to be simple necessary relational statements. Wittgenstein, at least, explicitly endorsed the position that all necessity is logical necessity (6.37). Some commentators also take the thesis that all necessity is logical necessity (Landini 2010, chap. 4; 2018), or the thesis that <em>de re</em> modality is to be rejected in favor of <em>de dicto</em> necessity (Cocchiarella 2007, chap. 3), to be key to Russell\u2019s logical atomism as well.</p>", "<p>\nRussell\u2019s precise positions on these matters is not as clear as one\nmight hope and nowhere does he treat them at any\nlength. The few pertinent remarks he does make are either somewhat\nambivalent or seem to work against interpreting him as holding strong\nversions of these theses.  For example, in 1914, in arguing that\natomic facts are typically known by direct empirical means rather than\nby inference, he wrote that \u201c[p]erhaps one atomic fact may\nsometimes be capable of being inferred from another, though I do not\nbelieve this to be the case; but in any case it cannot be inferred\nfrom premises no one of which is an atomic fact\u201d (<em>OKEW</em>,\n48). Here, Russell expressed doubt about the existence of any\nrelations of logical dependence between atomic propositions, but the\nfact that he left it as an open possibility makes it seem that he would\nnot consider it a defining feature of an atomic proposition that it\nmust be independent from all others, or a central tenet of logical\natomism generally that atomic facts are independent from one\nanother. In 1936 he even went so far as to mock Wittgenstein\u2019s claims\nthat atomic facts are independent of one another, and that all\ndeductions must be formal, by claiming that \u201cno one in fact holds\nthese views, and a philosophy which professes them cannot be wholly\nsincere\u201d (<em>LE</em>, 319).</p>", "<p>\n \nNevertheless, there a number of aspects of Russell\u2019s philosophical\npositions that lead to the conclusion that they cohere best with\n<em>some</em> doctrine about the independence of atomic facts or\npropositions. Russell did often speak about the <em>constituents</em>\nof atomic facts as independently existing entities. He writes for\nexample that \u201ceach particular has its being independently of any other\nand does not depend upon anything else for the logical possibility of\nits existence\u201d (<em>PLA</em>, 203). It is not altogether clear what\nRussell meant by speaking of particulars or entities as being\nlogically independent. In contemporary parlance, typically, \u201clogical\nindependence\u201d is used solely to speak of a relation between sentences,\npropositions, or perhaps facts or states of affairs. One possible\ninterpretation would be to take Russell as holding that any atomic\nfact involving a certain group of particulars is logically independent\nof an atomic fact involving a distinct group of particulars, even if\nthe two facts involve the same quality or relation (see, e.g., Bell\nand Demopoulos 1996, 118\u201319).  This weakened version of the\nindependence thesis even has certain attractions over the stronger\nprinciple endorsed by Wittgenstein. Most of the usual counterexamples\ngiven against the thesis that atomic facts or propositions are always\nindependent involve simple properties that are thought to be\nexclusive. Consider, for example, what has come to be called the\n\u201ccolor exclusion problem\u201d. The propositions \u201c<em>a</em> is red\u201d and\n\u201c<em>a</em> is blue\u201d do not seem to be independent from one another:\nfrom the truth of one the falsity of the other can seemingly be\ninferred. However, the weakened version of the independence principle,\non which only atomic facts involving <em>different</em> particulars\nare independent, does not entail that it is possible that \u201c<em>a</em>\nis red\u201d and \u201c<em>a</em> is blue\u201d may both be true.</p>", "<p>\n \nIt is likely that Russell\u2019s contention that particulars are\nindependent from one another was connected in his mind with his views\non relations. In holding the view that relations among simple\nparticulars are external, Russell saw himself as denying the view that\nwhen <em>a</em> bears <em>R</em> to <em>b</em>, there is some part of\n<em>a</em>\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d as an entity that involves its relatedness to\n<em>b</em>. It might be thought that Russell\u2019s doctrine of external\nrelations committed him at least to certain principles regarding the\nmodal status of atomic facts (if not the independence principle).\nAccording to certain ways of defining the phrase, what it\n<em>means</em> for a relation to be <em>internal</em> is that it is a\nrelation that its relata <em>could not</em> fail to have; an\n<em>external relation</em> is one its relata could possibly not\nhave. Russell then might be seen as committed to the view that atomic\nfacts (all of which involve particulars standing in relations, in the\nbroad sense above) are always contingent. While this does not directly\nbear on the question of their independence, it would nevertheless\ncommit Russell to certain tenets regarding the modal features of\natomic facts.</p>", "<p>\n \nHowever, Russell himself warned against interpreting his position on\nrelations this way, writing, \u201cthe doctrine that relations are\n\u2018external\u2019 \u2026 is not correctly expressed by saying\nthat two terms which have a certain relation might not have had that\nrelation. Such a statement introduces the notion of possibility and\nthus raises irrelevant difficulties\u201d (<em>BReal</em>,  87).\nComplicating matters here are Russell\u2019s own rather idiosyncratic and\nskeptical views about modal notions. Russell was dissatisfied with the\nprevailing conceptions of necessity and possibility among philosophers\nof his day, and argued instead against necessity (or possibility) as a\nfundamental or irreducible concept (see <em>NP passim</em>).</p>", "<p>\n \nDespite Russell\u2019s misgivings about modal notions, it is clear enough\nfrom Russell\u2019s conception of <em>logic</em> that logical relations\nbetween propositions would always obtain in virtue of their form\n(<em>IMP</em>, 197\u201398; <em>PLA</em>, 237\u201339). Again, atomic propositions are\nof the simplest possible forms, and there is certainly nothing in\ntheir forms that would suggest any logical connection to, or\nincompatibility with, other atomic propositions.</p>", "<p>\n \nPerhaps the most illuminating remarks to be found in Russell\u2019s work\nthat would lead one to expect complete logical independence among\natomic propositions involve the claims he made about how it is that\none recognizes a certain class of purported entities as \u201clogical\nconstructions\u201d, and the recommendations he gives about analyzing\npropositions involving them.  Russell writes:</p>", "<blockquote>\n When some set of supposed entities has neat logical properties, it\nturns out, in a great many instances, that the supposed entities can\nbe replaced by purely logical constructions composed of entities which\nhave not such neat properties. In that case, in interpreting a body of\npropositions hitherto believed to be about the supposed entities, we\ncan substitute the logical structures without altering any detail of\nthe body of propositions in question (<em>LA</em>, 326).</blockquote>", "<p>\n Russell did not define here what he means by \u201cneat logical\nproperties\u201d, but it is possible to understand what he had in mind by\nway of the examples he gave. He cited as \u201cneat properties\u201d of material\nobjects that it is impossible for two material objects to occupy the\nsame place at the same time, and that it is impossible for one\nmaterial object to occupy distinct places in space at the same time\n(<em>LA</em>, 329; cf. <em>AMi</em>, 264\u201365; <em>AMa</em>,\n385). Consider then the propositions \u201c<em>O</em><sub>1</sub> is\nlocated at <em>p</em><sub>1</sub> at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>\u201d, and\n\u201c<em>O</em><sub>1</sub> is located at <em>p</em><sub>2</sub> at\n<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>\u201d where \u201c<em>O</em><sub>1</sub>\u201d is the name of\na physical object, \u201c<em>p</em><sub>1</sub>\u201d and\n\u201c<em>p</em><sub>2</sub>\u201d represent distinct locations in space, and\n\u201c<em>t</em><sub>1</sub>\u201d the name of a certain instant in time.  Prior\nto analysis, such propositions appear to be logically incompatible\natomic propositions. However, Russell explains that the logical\nnecessities involved in cases such as these are due to the nature of\nmaterial objects, points and instants as logical constructions. At a\ncertain point in time, a physical object might be regarded as a class\nof sensible particulars bearing certain resemblance relations to one\nanother occupying a <em>continuous</em> region of space. It is\ntherefore impossible <em>by definition</em> for the same physical\nobject to occupy wholly distinct locations at the same time. When\nanalyzed, such propositions as \u201c<em>O</em><sub>1</sub> is located at\n<em>p</em><sub>1</sub> at <em>t</em><sub>1</sub>\u201d are revealed as\nhaving a much more complicated logical form, and hence may have\nlogical consequences not evident before analysis. We do not have here\nany reason to think that truly atomic propositions, those containing\nnames of genuine particulars and their relations, are not always\nindependent.</p>", "<p>\n \nRussell strongly intimated that it is a part of the very nature of\nlogical analysis that if our pre-analyzed understanding of a certain\nphenomenon involves the postulation of entities with certain\nstructural or modal properties, one should seek to replace talk of\nsuch entities with logical constructions specifically constituted so\nas to have these features by definition (<em>PLA</em>, 272\u201379;\n<em>LA</em>, 326\u201329). A logical construction would typically be\nunderstood as a sort of class; since discourse about classes was\nregarded by Russell as a convenience, which would be eliminated in a\nfully analyzed language in favor of speaking of their defining\nproperties and relations, by such a process Russell believed it is\npossible to replace commitment to entities having \u201cneat logical\nproperties\u201d with commitment to those that do not possess such\nfeatures. Russell\u2019s work on mathematics provides us with what he would have taken as many examples of this phenomenon. If we take \"3 &gt; 2\u201d and \"3 &lt; 2\u201d at face-value as expressing simple dyadic relations between simple entities <em>named</em> \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d, then these appear to be two atomic propositions, one necessary, one impossible, which are not independent of each other. But after analysis, \u201c2\u201d and \u201c3\u201d are revealed not to be names at all, and the necessity, impossibility, and mutual incompatibility of these statements is rendered purely logical.\nAssuming that there is a final terminus of analysis in\nabsolutely simple entities and fully atomic facts, one might suppose\nthat here  the logical necessities and relationships between them\nwould have completely disappeared.</p>", "<p>Russell later summarized the\nattitude of his logical atomist period by writing that \u201cit seemed to result that none of the raw material of the world has smooth logical\nproperties, but that whatever appears to have such properties is\nconstructed artificially in order to have them\u201d (<em>IPOM</em>,\nxi). While this is not exactly an endorsement of the claim that atomic\nfacts are logically independent of one another, it is perhaps the\nclosest sentiment one can find in his philosophy. It is again perhaps better understood as an endorsement of a methodological maxim. If a certain stage of analysis seems to portray entities as having \u201cneat\u201d logical properties, i.e., necessary features or relations not explained by logical form, this is a sign that more analysis is needed. Perhaps by analyzing the statements further, \u201cbusting open\u201d the apparent terms for these things to reveal more complicated logical forms, what appear to be necessary connections between atomic facts will be shown actually to be logically necessary relationships between non-atomic facts owed to their logical forms (cf. Elkind forthcoming).</p>", "<p>\n Russell\u2019s logical atomism had significant influence on the\ndevelopment of philosophy, especially in the first half of the 20th\ncentury.  Nowhere is Russell\u2019s influence more clearly seen than in the\nwork of his pupil Ludwig Wittgenstein. Wittgenstein\u2019s <em>Tractatus\nLogico-Philosophicus</em> appeared in 1921; in it, Wittgenstein\npresented in some detail a logical atomist metaphysics.  (It should be\nnoted, however, that there is significant controversy over whether, in\nthe end, Wittgenstein himself meant to endorse this metaphysics.)  In\nthe <em>Tractatus</em>, the world is described as consisting of\nfacts. The simplest facts, which Wittgenstein called\n\u201c<em>Sachverhalte</em>\u201d, translated either as \u201cstates of affairs\u201d or\n\u201catomic facts\u201d, are thought of as conglomerations of objects combined\nwith a definite structure. The objects making up these atomic basics\nwere described as absolutely simple. Elementary propositions are\npropositions whose truth depends entirely on the presence of an atomic\nfact, and other propositions have a determinate and unique analysis in\nwhich they can be construed as built up from elementary propositions in\ntruth-functional ways. </p>", "<p>\n \nPartly owing to Wittgenstein\u2019s influence, partly directly, Russell\u2019s\nlogical atomism had significant influence on the works of the logical\npositivist tradition, as exemplified in the works of Carnap, Waismann,\nHempel and Ayer.  This tradition usually disavowed metaphysical\nprinciples, but methodologically their philosophies owed much to\nRussell\u2019s approach. Carnap, for example, described philosophy as\ntaking the form of providing \u201cthe logical analysis of the language of\nscience\u201d (Carnap 1934, 61). This originally took the form of\nattempting to show that all meaningful scientific discourse could be\nanalyzed in terms of logical combinations beginning with \u201cprotocol\nsentences\u201d, or sentences directly confirmable or disconfirmable by\nexperience.  This notion of a \u201cprotocol sentence\u201d in this tradition\nwas originally modeled after Russellian and Wittgensteinian atomic\npropositions. The notion of a \u201clogical construction\u201d was also\nimportant for how such thinkers conceived of the nature of ordinary\nobjects (see, e.g., Ayer 1952, chap. 3). The view that scientific\nlanguage could readily and easily be analyzed directly in terms of\nobservables gradually gave way to more holistic views, such as Quine\u2019s\n(see, e.g. Quine 1951), in which it is claimed that it is only a body\nof scientific theories that can be compared to experience, and not\nisolated sentences.  However, even in later works growing out of this\ntradition, the influence of Russell can be felt.</p>", "<p>\n \nBesides positive influence, many trends in 20th century philosophy can\nbe best understood largely as a reaction to Russell\u2019s atomistic\nphilosophy. Ironically, nowhere is this more true than in the later\nwritings of Wittgenstein, especially his <em>Philosophical\nInvestigations</em> (1953). Among other things, Wittgenstein there\ncalled into question whether a single, unequivocal notion of\nsimplicity or a final state of analysis can be found (e.g.,\nsecs. 46\u201349, 91), and questioned the utility of an ideal language\n(sec. 81). Wittgenstein also called into question whether, in those\ncases in which analysis is possible, the results really give us what\nwas meant at the start: \u201cdoes someone who says that the broom is in\nthe corner really mean: the broomstick is there, and so is the brush,\nand the broomstick is fixed in the brush?\u201d (sec. 60). Much of the work\nof the so-called \u201cordinary language\u201d school of philosophy centered in\nOxford in the 1940s and 1950s can also been seen largely as a critical\nresponse to views of Russell (see, e.g., Austin 1962, Warnock 1951,\nUrmson 1956). </p>", "<p>\n \nNevertheless, despite the criticisms, many so-called \u201canalytic\u201d\nphilosophers still believe that the notion of analysis has some role\nto play in philosophical methodology, though there seems to be no\nconsensus regarding precisely what analysis consists in, and to what\nextent it leads reliably to metaphysically significant\nresults. Debates regarding the nature of simple entities, their\ninterrelations or dependencies between one another, and whether there\nare any such entities, are still alive and well.  Russell\u2019s rejection\nof idealistic monism, and his arguments in favor of a pluralistic\nuniverse, have gained almost universal acceptance, with a few\nexceptions. Abstracting away from Russell\u2019s particular examples of\nproposed analyses in terms of sensible particulars, the general\nframework of Russell\u2019s atomistic picture of the world, which consists\nof a plurality of entities that have qualities and enter into\nrelations, remains one to which many contemporary philosophers are\nattracted.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "logical-atomism"]}

In the \n<em>Concise Oxford Dictionary</em>, for example, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 is defined as the \u201cresolution into \nsimpler elements by analysing (opp. <em>synthesis</em>)\u201d, the \nonly other uses mentioned being the mathematical and the \npsychological \n [<a href=\"s1.html#COD\">Quotation</a>].\n And in the <em>Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</em>, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 is defined as \u201cthe process of breaking a\nconcept down into more simple parts, so that its logical structure is\ndisplayed\u201d \n [<a href=\"s1.html#ODP\">Quotation</a>].\n The restriction to concepts and the reference to displaying \n\u2018logical structure\u2019 are important qualifications, but the\ncore conception remains that of breaking something down.</p>", "<p>\n\nThis conception may be called the <em>decompositional</em> conception\nof analysis (see \n <a href=\"#4\">Section 4</a>).\n But it is not the only conception, and indeed is arguably neither the\ndominant conception in the pre-modern period nor the conception that \nis characteristic of at least one major strand in \n\u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy. In ancient Greek thought, \n\u2018analysis\u2019 referred primarily to the process of working \nback to first principles by means of which something could then be \ndemonstrated. This conception may be called the <em>regressive</em> \nconception of analysis (see \n <a href=\"#AncConc\">Section 2</a>).\n In the work of Frege and Russell, on the other hand, before the \nprocess of decomposition could take place, the statements to be \nanalyzed had first to be translated into their \u2018correct\u2019 \nlogical form (see \n <a href=\"#6\">Section 6</a>).\n This suggests that analysis also involves a <em>transformative</em> \nor <em>interpretive</em> dimension.

The term was readily extended to the \nsolving or dissolving of a problem, and it was in this sense that it \nwas employed in ancient Greek geometry and philosophy. The method of \nanalysis that was developed in ancient Greek geometry had an \ninfluence on both Plato and Aristotle. Also important, however, was \nthe influence of Socrates's concern with definition, in which \nthe roots of modern conceptual analysis can be found. What we have in\nancient Greek thought, then, is a complex web of methodologies, of \nwhich the most important are Socratic definition, which Plato \nelaborated into his method of division, his related method of \nhypothesis, which drew on geometrical analysis, and the method(s) \nthat Aristotle developed in his <em>Analytics</em>. Far from a \nconsensus having established itself over the last two millennia, the \nrelationships between these methodologies are the subject of \nincreasing debate today. At the heart of all of them, too, lie the \nphilosophical problems raised by Meno's paradox, which \nanticipates what we now know as the paradox of analysis, concerning \nhow an analysis can be both correct and informative (see the \nsupplementary section on \n <a href=\"s6.html#4\">Moore</a>),\n and Plato's attempt to solve it through the theory of \nrecollection, which has spawned a vast literature on its own.</p>", "<p>\n\n\u2018Analysis\u2019 was first used in a methodological sense in \nancient Greek geometry, and the model that Euclidean geometry \nprovided has been an inspiration ever since.

Plato is even credited by Diogenes \nLaertius (<em>LEP</em>, I, 299) with inventing the method of \nanalysis, but whatever the truth of this may be, the influence of \ngeometry starts to show in his middle dialogues, and he certainly \nencouraged work on geometry in his Academy.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe classic source for our understanding of ancient Greek geometrical\nanalysis is a passage in Pappus's <em>Mathematical \nCollection</em>, which was composed around 300 AD, and hence drew on \na further six centuries of work in geometry from the time of \nEuclid's <em>Elements</em>:</p>", "<blockquote>Now analysis is the way from what is sought\u2014as if it\nwere admitted\u2014through its concomitants (<em>akolouth\u00f4n</em>)\nin order[,] to something admitted in synthesis.

Sentences involving more \nthan one quantifier such as \u2018Some donkey every man sees\u2019,\nfor example, were recognized as ambiguous, requiring \n\u2018exposition\u2019 to clarify.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn John Buridan's masterpiece of the mid-fourteenth century, \nthe <em>Summulae de Dialectica</em>, we can find all three of the \nconceptions outlined in \n <a href=\"#1.1\">Section 1.1</a>\n above. He distinguishes explicitly between divisions, definitions and\ndemonstrations, corresponding to decompositional, interpretive and \nregressive analysis, respectively. Here, in particular, we have \nanticipations of modern analytic philosophy as much as reworkings of \nancient philosophy. Unfortunately, however, these clearer forms of \nanalysis became overshadowed during the Renaissance, despite\u2014or\nperhaps because of\u2014the growing interest in the original Greek \nsources. As far as understanding analytic methodologies was \nconcerned, the humanist repudiation of scholastic logic muddied the \nwaters.</p>", "<p>\n\nFurther discussion can be found in the supplementary document on</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"s3.html\" name=\"return-3\">Medieval and Renaissance Conceptions of Analysis</a>.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nFurther reading can be found in the</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"bib3.html\">Annotated Bibliography, \u00a73</a>.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThe scientific revolution in the seventeenth century brought with it \nnew forms of analysis. The newest of these emerged through the \ndevelopment of more sophisticated mathematical techniques, but even \nthese still had their roots in earlier conceptions of analysis. By \nthe end of the early modern period, decompositional analysis had \nbecome dominant (as outlined in what follows), but this, too, took \ndifferent forms, and the relationships between the various \nconceptions of analysis were often far from clear.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn common with the Renaissance, the early modern period was marked by\na great concern with methodology. This might seem unsurprising in \nsuch a revolutionary period, when new techniques for understanding \nthe world were being developed and that understanding itself was \nbeing transformed. But what characterizes many of the treatises and \nremarks on methodology that appeared in the seventeenth century is \ntheir appeal, frequently self-conscious, to ancient methods (despite,\nor perhaps\u2014for diplomatic reasons\u2014because of, the \ncritique of the <em>content</em> of traditional thought), although \nnew wine was generally poured into the old bottles. The model of \ngeometrical analysis was a particular inspiration here, albeit \nfiltered through the Aristotelian tradition, which had assimilated \nthe regressive process of going from theorems to axioms with that of \nmoving from effects to causes (see the supplementary section on \n <a href=\"s2.html#4\">Aristotle</a>).\n Analysis came to be seen as a method of discovery, working back from \nwhat is ordinarily known to the underlying reasons (demonstrating \n\u2018the fact\u2019), and synthesis as a method of proof, working \nforwards again from what is discovered to what needed explanation \n(demonstrating \u2018the reason why\u2019). Analysis and synthesis \nwere thus taken as complementary, although there remained \ndisagreement over their respective merits.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere is a manuscript by Galileo, dating from around 1589, an \nappropriated commentary on Aristotle's <em>Posterior \nAnalytics</em>, which shows his concern with methodology, and \nregressive analysis, in particular (see Wallace 1992a and 1992b). \nHobbes wrote a chapter on method in the first part of <em>De \nCorpore</em>, published in 1655, which offers his own interpretation \nof the method of analysis and synthesis, where decompositional forms \nof analysis are articulated alongside regressive forms \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Hobbes\">Quotations</a>].\n But perhaps the most influential account of methodology, from the \nmiddle of the seventeenth century until well into the nineteenth \ncentury, was the fourth part of the Port-Royal <em>Logic</em>, the \nfirst edition of which appeared in 1662 and the final revised edition\nin 1683. Chapter 2 (which was the first chapter in the first edition)\nopens as follows:</p>", "<blockquote>The art of arranging a series of thoughts properly, either\nfor discovering the truth when we do not know it, or for proving to\nothers what we already know, can generally be called method. \n\n<p>\n\nHence there are two kinds of method, one for discovering the truth, \nwhich is known as <em>analysis</em>, or the <em>method of \nresolution</em>, and which can also be called the <em>method of \ndiscovery</em>. The other is for making the truth understood by \nothers once it is found. This is known as <em>synthesis</em>, or the \n<em>method of composition</em>, and can also be called the <em>method\nof instruction</em>. \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Arnauld\">Fuller Quotations</a>]\n </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThat a number of different methods might be assimilated here is not \nnoted, although the text does go on to distinguish four main types of\n\u2018issues concerning things\u2019: seeking causes by their \neffects, seeking effects by their causes, finding the whole from the \nparts, and looking for another part from the whole and a given part \n(<em>ibid</em>., 234). While the first two involve regressive \nanalysis and synthesis, the third and fourth involve decompositional \nanalysis and synthesis.</p>", "<p>\n\nAs the authors of the <em>Logic</em> make clear, this particular part\nof their text derives from Descartes's <em>Rules for the \nDirection of the Mind</em>, written around 1627, but only published \nposthumously in 1684. The specification of the four types was most \nlikely offered in elaborating Descartes's Rule Thirteen, which \nstates: \u201cIf we perfectly understand a problem we must abstract \nit from every superfluous conception, reduce it to its simplest terms\nand, by means of an enumeration, divide it up into the smallest \npossible parts.\u201d (<em>PW</em>, I, 51. Cf. the editorial \ncomments in <em>PW</em>, I, 54, 77.) The decompositional conception \nof analysis is explicit here, and if we follow this up into the later\n<em>Discourse on Method</em>, published in 1637, the focus has \nclearly shifted from the regressive to the decompositional conception\nof analysis. All the rules offered in the earlier work have now been \nreduced to just four. This is how Descartes reports the rules he says\nhe adopted in his scientific and philosophical work:</p>", "<blockquote>The first was never to accept anything as true if I did not\nhave evident knowledge of its truth: that is, carefully to avoid\nprecipitate conclusions and preconceptions, and to include nothing more\nin my judgements than what presented itself to my mind so clearly and\nso distinctly that I had no occasion to doubt it. \n\n<p>\n\nThe second, to divide each of the difficulties I examined into as \nmany parts as possible and as may be required in order to resolve \nthem better.</p>\n\n<p>\n\nThe third, to direct my thoughts in an orderly manner, by beginning \nwith the simplest and most easily known objects in the order to \nascend little by little, step by step, to knowledge of the most \ncomplex, and by supposing some order even among objects that have no \nnatural order of precedence.</p>\n\n<p>\n\nAnd the last, throughout to make enumerations so complete, and \nreviews so comprehensive, that I could be sure of leaving nothing \nout. (<em>PW</em>, I, 120.)</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThe first two are rules of analysis and the second two rules of \nsynthesis. But although the analysis/synthesis structure remains, \nwhat is involved here is decomposition/composition rather than \nregression/progression. Nevertheless, Descartes insisted that it was \ngeometry that influenced him here: \u201cThose long chains composed \nof very simple and easy reasonings, which geometers customarily use \nto arrive at their most difficult demonstrations, had given me \noccasion to suppose that all the things which can fall under human \nknowledge are interconnected in the same way.\u201d (<em>Ibid</em>. \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Descartes\">Further Quotations</a>])\n </p>", "<p>\n\nDescartes's geometry did indeed involve the breaking down of \ncomplex problems into simpler ones. More significant, however, was \nhis use of algebra in developing \u2018analytic\u2019 geometry as \nit came to be called, which allowed geometrical problems to be \ntransformed into arithmetical ones and more easily solved. In \nrepresenting the \u2018unknown\u2019 to be found by \n\u2018<em>x</em>\u2019, we can see the central role played in \nanalysis by the idea of taking something as \u2018given\u2019 and \nworking back from that, which made it seem appropriate to regard \nalgebra as an \u2018art of analysis\u2019, alluding to the \nregressive conception of the ancients. Illustrated in analytic \ngeometry in its developed form, then, we can see all three of the \nconceptions of analysis outlined in \n <a href=\"#1.1\">Section 1.1</a>\n above, despite Descartes's own emphasis on the decompositional \nconception. For further discussion of this, see the supplementary \nsection on \n <a href=\"s4.html#2\">Descartes and Analytic Geometry</a>.\n </p>", "<p>\n\nDescartes's emphasis on decompositional analysis was not \nwithout precedents, however. Not only was it already involved in \nancient Greek geometry, but it was also implicit in Plato's \nmethod of collection and division. We might explain the shift from \nregressive to decompositional (conceptual) analysis, as well as the \nconnection between the two, in the following way. Consider a simple \nexample, as represented in the diagram below, \n\u2018collecting\u2019 all animals and \u2018dividing\u2019 them \ninto <em>rational</em> and <em>non-rational</em>, in order to define \nhuman beings as rational animals.</p>", "<blockquote><img src=\"Diagplat.jpg\" width=\"295\" alt=\"division\"></blockquote>", "<p>\n\nOn this model, in seeking to define anything, we work back up the \nappropriate classificatory hierarchy to find the higher (i.e., more \nbasic or more general) \u2018Forms\u2019, by means of which we can \nlay down the definition. Although Plato did not himself use the term \n\u2018analysis\u2019\u2014the word for \u2018division\u2019 was \n\u2018<em>dihairesis</em>\u2019\u2014the finding of the \nappropriate \u2018Forms\u2019 is essentially analysis. As an \nelaboration of the Socratic search for definitions, we clearly have \nin this the origins of conceptual analysis. There is little \ndisagreement that \u2018Human beings are rational animals\u2019 is \nthe kind of definition we are seeking, defining one concept, the \nconcept <em>human being</em>, in terms of other concepts, the \nconcepts <em>rational</em> and <em>animal</em>. But the construals \nthat have been offered of this have been more problematic. \nUnderstanding a classificatory hierarchy <em>extensionally</em>, that\nis, in terms of the classes of things denoted, the classes higher up \nare clearly the larger, \u2018containing\u2019 the classes lower \ndown as subclasses (e.g., the class of animals includes the class of \nhuman beings as one of its subclasses). <em>Intensionally</em>, \nhowever, the relationship of \u2018containment\u2019 has been seen \nas holding in the opposite direction. If someone understands the \nconcept <em>human being</em>, at least in the strong sense of knowing\nits definition, then they must understand the concepts \n<em>animal</em> and <em>rational</em>; and it has often then seemed \nnatural to talk of the concept <em>human being</em> as \n\u2018containing\u2019 the concepts <em>rational</em> and \n<em>animal</em>. Working back up the hierarchy in \n\u2018analysis\u2019 (in the regressive sense) could then come to \nbe identified with \u2018unpacking\u2019 or \n\u2018decomposing\u2019 a concept into its \n\u2018constituent\u2019 concepts (\u2018analysis\u2019 in the \ndecompositional sense). Of course, talking of \n\u2018decomposing\u2019 a concept into its \n\u2018constituents\u2019 is, strictly speaking, only a metaphor (as\nQuine was famously to remark in \u00a71 of \u2018Two Dogmas of \nEmpiricism\u2019), but in the early modern period, this began to be \ntaken more literally.</p>", "<p>\n\nFor further discussion, see the supplementary document on</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"s4.html\" name=\"return-4\">Early Modern Conceptions of Analysis</a>,</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nwhich contains sections on Descartes and Analytic Geometry, British \nEmpiricism, Leibniz, and Kant.</p>", "<p>\n\nFor further reading, see the</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"bib4.html\">Annotated Bibliography, \u00a74</a>.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nAs suggested in the supplementary document on \n <a href=\"s4.html#5\">Kant</a>,\n the decompositional conception of analysis found its classic \nstatement in the work of Kant at the end of the eighteenth century. \nBut Kant was only expressing a conception widespread at the time. The\nconception can be found in a very blatant form, for example, in the \nwritings of Moses Mendelssohn, for whom, unlike Kant, it was \napplicable even in the case of geometry \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Mendelssohn\">Quotation</a>].\n Typified in Kant's and Mendelssohn's view of concepts, it\nwas also reflected in scientific practice. Indeed, its popularity was\nfostered by the chemical revolution inaugurated by Lavoisier in the \nlate eighteenth century, the comparison between philosophical \nanalysis and chemical analysis being frequently drawn. As Lichtenberg\nput it, \u201cWhichever way you look at it, philosophy is always \nanalytical chemistry\u201d \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Lichtenberg\">Quotation</a>].\n </p>", "<p>\n\nThis decompositional conception of analysis set the methodological \nagenda for philosophical approaches and debates in the (late) modern \nperiod (nineteenth and twentieth centuries). Responses and \ndevelopments, very broadly, can be divided into two. On the one hand,\nan essentially decompositional conception of analysis was accepted, \nbut a critical attitude was adopted towards it. If analysis simply \ninvolved breaking something down, then it appeared destructive and \nlife-diminishing, and the critique of analysis that this view \nengendered was a common theme in idealism and romanticism in all its \nmain varieties\u2014from German, British and French to North \nAmerican. One finds it reflected, for example, in remarks about the \nnegating and soul-destroying power of analytical thinking by Schiller\n\n [<a href=\"s1.html#Schiller\">Quotation</a>],\n Hegel \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Hegel\">Quotation</a>]\n and de Chardin \n [<a href=\"s1.html#DeChardin\">Quotation</a>],\n in Bradley's doctrine that analysis is falsification \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Bradley\">Quotation</a>],\n and in the emphasis placed by Bergson on \u2018intuition\u2019 \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Bergson\">Quotation</a>].\n </p>", "<p>\n\nOn the other hand, analysis was seen more positively, but the Kantian\nconception underwent a certain degree of modification and \ndevelopment. In the nineteenth century, this was exemplified, in \nparticular, by Bolzano and the neo-Kantians. Bolzano's most \nimportant innovation was the method of variation, which involves \nconsidering what happens to the truth-value of a sentence when a \nconstituent term is substituted by another. This formed the basis for\nhis reconstruction of the analytic/synthetic distinction, \nKant's account of which he found defective. The neo-Kantians \nemphasized the role of structure in conceptualized experience and had\na greater appreciation of forms of analysis in mathematics and \nscience. In many ways, their work attempts to do justice to \nphilosophical and scientific practice while recognizing the central \nidealist claim that analysis is a kind of abstraction that inevitably\ninvolves falsification or distortion. On the neo-Kantian view, the \ncomplexity of experience is a complexity of form and content rather \nthan of separable constituents, requiring analysis into \n\u2018moments\u2019 or \u2018aspects\u2019 rather than \n\u2018elements\u2019 or \u2018parts\u2019. In the 1910s, the idea\nwas articulated with great subtlety by Ernst Cassirer \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Cassirer\">Quotation</a>],\n and became familiar in Gestalt psychology.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn the twentieth century, both analytic philosophy and phenomenology \ncan be seen as developing far more sophisticated conceptions of \nanalysis, which draw on but go beyond mere decompositional analysis. \nThe following \n <a href=\"#6\">Section</a>\n offers an account of analysis in analytic philosophy, illustrating \nthe range and richness of the conceptions and practices that arose. \nBut it is important to see these in the wider context of \ntwentieth-century methodological practices and debates, for it is not\njust in \u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy\u2014despite its \nname\u2014that analytic methods are accorded a central role. \nPhenomenology, in particular, contains its own distinctive set of \nanalytic methods, with similarities and differences to those of \nanalytic philosophy. Phenomenological analysis has frequently been \ncompared to conceptual clarification in the ordinary language \ntradition, for example, and the method of \u2018phenomenological \nreduction\u2019 that Husserl invented in 1905 offers a striking \nparallel to the reductive project opened up by Russell's theory\nof descriptions, which also made its appearance in 1905.</p>", "<p>\n\nJust like Frege and Russell, Husserl's initial concern was with\nthe foundations of mathematics, and in this shared concern we can see\nthe continued influence of the regressive conception of analysis. \nAccording to Husserl, the aim of \u2018eidetic reduction\u2019, as \nhe called it, was to isolate the \u2018essences\u2019 that underlie\nour various forms of thinking, and to apprehend them by \n\u2018essential intuition\u2019 \n(\u2018<em>Wesenserschauung</em>\u2019). The terminology may be \ndifferent, but this resembles Russell's early project to \nidentify the \u2018indefinables\u2019 of philosophical logic, as he\ndescribed it, and to apprehend them by \u2018acquaintance\u2019 \n(cf. <em>POM</em>, xx). Furthermore, in Husserl's later \ndiscussion of \u2018explication\u2019 (cf. <em>EJ</em>, \n\u00a7\u00a7 22-4 \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Husserl\">Quotations</a>]),\n we find appreciation of the \u2018transformative\u2019 dimension of\nanalysis, which can be fruitfully compared with Carnap's \naccount of explication (see the supplementary section on \n <a href=\"s6.html#7\">Carnap and Logical Positivism</a>).\n Carnap himself describes Husserl's idea here as one of \n\u201cthe synthesis of identification between a confused, \nnonarticulated sense and a subsequently intended distinct, \narticulated sense\u201d (1950, 3 \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Carnap\">Quotation</a>]).\n </p>", "<p>\n\nPhenomenology is not the only source of analytic methodologies \noutside those of the analytic tradition. Mention might be made here, \ntoo, of R. G. Collingwood, working within the tradition of British \nidealism, which was still a powerful force prior to the Second World \nWar. In his <em>Essay on Philosophical Method</em> (1933), for \nexample, he criticizes Moorean philosophy, and develops his own \nresponse to what is essentially the paradox of analysis (concerning \nhow an analysis can be both correct and informative), which he \nrecognizes as having its root in Meno's paradox. In his \n<em>Essay on Metaphysics</em> (1940), he puts forward his own \nconception of metaphysical analysis, in direct response to what he \nperceived as the mistaken repudiation of metaphysics by the logical \npositivists. Metaphysical analysis is characterized here as the \ndetection of \u2018absolute presuppositions\u2019, which are taken \nas underlying and shaping the various conceptual practices that can \nbe identified in the history of philosophy and science. Even among \nthose explicitly critical of central strands in analytic philosophy, \nthen, analysis in one form or another can still be seen as alive and \nwell.</p>", "<p>\nFor further reading, see the</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"bib5.html\">Annotated Bibliography, \u00a75</a>.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIf anything characterizes \u2018analytic\u2019 philosophy, then it \nis presumably the emphasis placed on analysis. But as the foregoing \nsections have shown, there is a wide range of conceptions of \nanalysis, so such a characterization says nothing that would \ndistinguish analytic philosophy from much of what has either preceded\nor developed alongside it. Given that the decompositional conception \nis usually offered as the main conception today, it might be thought \nthat it is this that characterizes analytic philosophy. But this \nconception was prevalent in the early modern period, shared by both \nthe British Empiricists and Leibniz, for example. Given that Kant \ndenied the importance of decompositional analysis, however, it might \nbe suggested that what characterizes analytic philosophy is the \n<em>value</em> it places on such analysis. This might be true of \nMoore's early work, and of one strand within analytic \nphilosophy; but it is not generally true. What characterizes analytic\nphilosophy as it was founded by Frege and Russell is the role played \nby <em>logical analysis</em>, which depended on the development of \nmodern logic. Although other and subsequent forms of analysis, such \nas linguistic analysis, were less wedded to systems of formal logic, \nthe central insight motivating logical analysis remained.</p>", "<p>\n\nPappus's account of method in ancient Greek geometry suggests \nthat the regressive conception of analysis was dominant at the \ntime\u2014however much other conceptions may also have been \nimplicitly involved (see the supplementary section on \n <a href=\"s2.html#2\">Ancient Greek Geometry</a>).\n In the early modern period, the decompositional conception became \nwidespread (see \n <a href=\"#4\">Section 4</a>).\n What characterizes analytic philosophy\u2014or at least that central\nstrand that originates in the work of Frege and Russell\u2014is the \nrecognition of what was called earlier the <em>transformative</em> or\n<em>interpretive</em> dimension of analysis (see \n <a href=\"#1.1\">Section 1.1</a>).\n Any analysis presupposes a particular framework of interpretation, \nand work is done in <em>interpreting</em> what we are seeking to \nanalyze as part of the process of regression and decomposition. This \nmay involve <em>transforming</em> it in some way, in order for the \nresources of a given theory or conceptual framework to be brought to \nbear. Euclidean geometry provides a good illustration of this. But it\nis even more obvious in the case of analytic geometry, where the \ngeometrical problem is first \u2018translated\u2019 into the \nlanguage of algebra and arithmetic in order to solve it more easily \n(see the supplementary section on \n <a href=\"s4.html#2\">Descartes and Analytic Geometry</a>).\n What Descartes and Fermat did for analytic geometry, Frege and \nRussell did for analytic philosophy. Analytic philosophy is \n\u2018analytic\u2019 much more in the sense that analytic geometry \nis \u2018analytic\u2019 than in the crude decompositional sense \nthat Kant understood it.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe interpretive dimension of modern philosophical analysis can also \nbe seen as anticipated in medieval scholasticism (see the \nsupplementary section on \n <a href=\"s3.html#1\">Medieval Philosophy</a>),\n and it is remarkable just how much of modern concerns with \npropositions, meaning, reference, and so on, can be found in the \nmedieval literature. Interpretive analysis is also illustrated in the\nnineteenth century by Bentham's conception of \n<em>paraphrasis</em>, which he characterized as \u201cthat sort of \nexposition which may be afforded by transmuting into a proposition, \nhaving for its subject some real entity, a proposition which has not \nfor its subject any other than a fictitious entity\u201d \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Bentham\">Full Quotation</a>].\n He applied the idea in \u2018analyzing away\u2019 talk of \n\u2018obligations\u2019, and the anticipation that we can see here \nof Russell's theory of descriptions has been noted by, among \nothers, Wisdom (1931) and Quine in \u2018Five Milestones of \nEmpiricism\u2019 \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Quine\">Quotation</a>].\n </p>", "<p>\n\nWhat was crucial in the emergence of twentieth-century analytic \nphilosophy, however, was the development of quantificational theory, \nwhich provided a far more powerful interpretive system than anything \nthat had hitherto been available. In the case of Frege and Russell, \nthe system into which statements were \u2018translated\u2019 was \npredicate logic, and the divergence that was thereby opened up \nbetween grammatical and logical form meant that the process of \ntranslation itself became an issue of philosophical concern. This \ninduced greater self-consciousness about our use of language and its \npotential to mislead us, and inevitably raised semantic, \nepistemological and metaphysical questions about the relationships \nbetween language, logic, thought and reality which have been at the \ncore of analytic philosophy ever since.</p>", "<p>\n\nBoth Frege and Russell (after the latter's initial flirtation \nwith idealism) were concerned to show, against Kant, that arithmetic \nis a system of analytic and not synthetic truths. In the \n<em>Grundlagen</em>, Frege had offered a revised conception of \nanalyticity, which arguably endorses and generalizes Kant's \nlogical as opposed to phenomenological criterion, i.e., (AN<font size=\"-2\">L</font>) rather than (AN<font size=\"-2\">O</font>) (see the\nsupplementary section on \n <a href=\"s4.html#5\">Kant</a>):\n </p>", "<blockquote>(AN) A truth is <em>analytic</em> if its proof depends only\non general logical laws and definitions.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThe question of whether arithmetical truths are analytic then comes \ndown to the question of whether they can be derived purely logically.\n(Here we already have \u2018transformation\u2019, at the \ntheoretical level\u2014involving a reinterpretation of the concept \nof analyticity.) To demonstrate this, Frege realized that he needed \nto develop logical theory in order to formalize mathematical \nstatements, which typically involve multiple generality (e.g., \n\u2018Every natural number has a successor\u2019, i.e. \u2018For \nevery natural number <em>x</em> there is another natural number \n<em>y</em> that is the successor of <em>x</em>\u2019). This \ndevelopment, by extending the use of function-argument analysis in \nmathematics to logic and providing a notation for quantification, was\nessentially the achievement of his first book, the \n<em>Begriffsschrift</em> (1879), where he not only created the first \nsystem of predicate logic but also, using it, succeeded in giving a \nlogical analysis of mathematical induction (see Frege <em>FR</em>, \n47-78).</p>", "<p>\n\nIn his second book, <em>Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik</em> (1884), \nFrege went on to provide a logical analysis of number statements. His\ncentral idea was that a number statement contains an assertion about \na concept. A statement such as \u2018Jupiter has four moons\u2019 \nis to be understood not as predicating of Jupiter the property of \nhaving four moons, but as predicating of the concept <em>moon of \nJupiter</em> the second-level property <em>has four instances</em>, \nwhich can be logically defined. The significance of this construal \ncan be brought out by considering negative existential statements \n(which are equivalent to number statements involving the number 0). \nTake the following negative existential statement:</p>", "<blockquote>(0a) Unicorns do not exist.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIf we attempt to analyze this <em>decompositionally</em>, taking its \ngrammatical form to mirror its logical form, then we find ourselves \nasking what these unicorns are that have the property of \nnon-existence. We may then be forced to posit the \n<em>subsistence</em>\u2014as opposed to <em>existence</em>\u2014of \nunicorns, just as Meinong and the early Russell did, in order for \nthere to be something that is the subject of our statement. On the \nFregean account, however, to deny that something exists is to say \nthat the relevant <em>concept</em> has no instances: there is no need\nto posit any mysterious <em>object</em>. The Fregean analysis of (0a)\nconsists in <em>rephrasing</em> it into (0b), which can then be \nreadily formalized in the new logic as (0c):</p>", "<blockquote>(0b) The concept <em>unicorn</em> is not instantiated. \n\n<p>\n\n(0c) ~(\u2203<em>x</em>) <em>Fx</em>.</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nSimilarly, to say that God exists is to say that the concept \n<em>God</em> is (uniquely) instantiated, i.e., to deny that the \nconcept has 0 instances (or 2 or more instances). On this view, \nexistence is no longer seen as a (first-level) predicate, but \ninstead, existential statements are analyzed in terms of the \n(second-level) predicate <em>is instantiated</em>, represented by \nmeans of the existential quantifier. As Frege notes, this offers a \nneat diagnosis of what is wrong with the ontological argument, at \nleast in its traditional form (<em>GL</em>, \u00a753). All the \nproblems that arise if we try to apply decompositional analysis (at \nleast straight off) simply drop away, although an account is still \nneeded, of course, of concepts and quantifiers.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe possibilities that this strategy of \u2018translating\u2019 \ninto a logical language opens up are enormous: we are no longer \nforced to treat the surface grammatical form of a statement as a \nguide to its \u2018real\u2019 form, and are provided with a means \nof representing that form. This is the value of logical analysis: it \nallows us to \u2018analyze away\u2019 problematic linguistic \nexpressions and explain what it is \u2018really\u2019 going on. \nThis strategy was employed, most famously, in Russell's theory \nof descriptions, which was a major motivation behind the ideas of \nWittgenstein's <em>Tractatus</em> (see the supplementary \nsections on \n <a href=\"s6.html#3\">Russell</a>\n and \n <a href=\"s6.html#5\">Wittgenstein</a>).\n Although subsequent philosophers were to question the assumption that\nthere could ever be a definitive logical analysis of a given \nstatement, the idea that ordinary language may be systematically \nmisleading has remained.</p>", "<p>\n\nTo illustrate this, consider the following examples from Ryle's\nclassic 1932 paper, \u2018Systematically Misleading \nExpressions\u2019:</p>", "<blockquote>(Ua) Unpunctuality is reprehensible. \n\n<p>\n\n(Ta) Jones hates the thought of going to hospital.</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIn each case, we might be tempted to make unnecessary reifications, \ntaking \u2018unpunctuality\u2019 and \u2018the thought of going to\nhospital\u2019 as referring to objects. It is because of this that \nRyle describes such expressions as \u2018systematically \nmisleading\u2019. (Ua) and (Ta) must therefore be rephrased:</p>", "<blockquote>(Ub) Whoever is unpunctual deserves that other people\nshould reprove him for being unpunctual. \n\n<p>\n\n(Tb) Jones feels distressed when he thinks of what he will undergo if\nhe goes to hospital.</p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIn these formulations, there is no overt talk at all of \n\u2018unpunctuality\u2019 or \u2018thoughts\u2019, and hence \nnothing to tempt us to posit the existence of any corresponding \nentities. The problems that otherwise arise have thus been \n\u2018analyzed away\u2019.</p>", "<p>\n\nAt the time that Ryle wrote \u2018Systematically Misleading \nExpressions\u2019, he, too, assumed that every statement had an \nunderlying logical form that was to be exhibited in its \n\u2018correct\u2019 formulation \n [<a href=\"s1.html#Ryle\">Quotations</a>].\n But when he gave up this assumption (for reasons indicated in the \nsupplementary section on \n <a href=\"s6.html#6\">The Cambridge School of Analysis</a>),\n he did not give up the motivating idea of logical analysis\u2014to \nshow what is wrong with misleading expressions. In <em>The Concept of\nMind</em> (1949), for example, he sought to explain what he called \nthe \u2018category-mistake\u2019 involved in talk of the mind as a \nkind of \u2018Ghost in the Machine\u2019. His aim, he wrote, was to\n\u201crectify the logical geography of the knowledge which we \nalready possess\u201d (1949, 9), an idea that was to lead to the \narticulation of <em>connective</em> rather than <em>reductive</em> \nconceptions of analysis, the emphasis being placed on elucidating the\nrelationships between concepts without assuming that there is a \nprivileged set of intrinsically basic concepts (see the supplementary\nsection on \n <a href=\"s6.html#8\">Oxford Linguistic Philosophy</a>).\n </p>", "<p>\n\nWhat these various forms of logical analysis suggest, then, is that \nwhat characterizes analysis in analytic philosophy is something far \nricher than the mere \u2018decomposition\u2019 of a concept into \nits \u2018constituents\u2019. But this is not to say that the \ndecompositional conception of analysis plays no role at all. It can \nbe found in the early work of Moore, for example (see the \nsupplementary section on \n <a href=\"s6.html#4\">Moore</a>).\n It might also be seen as reflected in the approach to the analysis of\nconcepts that seeks to specify the necessary and sufficient \nconditions for their correct employment. Conceptual analysis in this \nsense goes back to the Socrates of Plato's early dialogues (see\nthe supplementary section on \n <a href=\"s2.html#3\">Plato</a>).\n But it arguably reached its heyday in the 1950s and 1960s. As \nmentioned in \n <a href=\"#AncConc\">Section 2</a>\n above, the definition of \u2018knowledge\u2019 as \u2018justified \ntrue belief\u2019 is perhaps the most famous example; and this \ndefinition was criticised in Gettier's classic paper of 1963. \n(For details of this, see the entry in this Encyclopedia on \n <a href=\"../knowledge-analysis/\">The Analysis of Knowledge</a>.)\n The specification of necessary and sufficient conditions may no \nlonger be seen as the primary aim of conceptual analysis, especially \nin the case of philosophical concepts such as \n\u2018knowledge\u2019, which are fiercely contested; but \nconsideration of such conditions remains a useful tool in the \nanalytic philosopher's toolbag.</p>", "<p>\n\nFor a more detailed account of the these and related conceptions of \nanalysis, see the supplementary document on</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"s6.html\" name=\"return-6\">Conceptions of Analysis in Analytic Philosophy</a>.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nFor further reading, see the</p>", "<blockquote><a href=\"bib6.html\">Annotated Bibliography, \u00a76</a>.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThe history of philosophy reveals a rich source of conceptions of \nanalysis. Their origin may lie in ancient Greek geometry, and to this\nextent the history of analytic methodologies might be seen as a \nseries of footnotes to Euclid. But analysis developed in different \nthough related ways in the two traditions stemming from Plato and \nAristotle, the former based on the search for definitions and the \nlatter on the idea of regression to first causes. The two poles \nrepresented in these traditions defined methodological space until \nwell into the early modern period, and in some sense is still \nreflected today. The creation of analytic geometry in the seventeenth\ncentury introduced a more reductive form of analysis, and an \nanalogous and even more powerful form was introduced around the turn \nof the twentieth century in the logical work of Frege and Russell. \nAlthough conceptual analysis, construed decompositionally from the \ntime of Leibniz and Kant, and mediated by the work of Moore, is often\nviewed as characteristic of analytic philosophy, logical analysis, \ntaken as involving translation into a logical system, is what \ninaugurated the analytic tradition. Analysis has also frequently been\nseen as reductive, but connective forms of analysis are no less \nimportant. Connective analysis, historically inflected, would seem to\nbe particularly appropriate, for example, in understanding analysis \nitself.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "analysis"]}

She received a First in\nLiterae Humaniores (Classics and Philosophy) in 1941. After her\ngraduation in 1941 she remained for a while at St. Hugh\u2019s as a\nresearch student, later moving to Newnham College, Cambridge in\n1942. In 1946 she was offered a Research Fellowship at Somerville\nCollege, Oxford and then was appointed to a teaching Fellowship there\nin 1964. She moved from Oxford to Cambridge in 1970 when she was\nawarded a Chair of Philosophy at Cambridge\u2014the Chair formerly\noccupied by Ludwig Wittgenstein.

They\nwere married in 1941. They had three sons and four daughters.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe did not avoid controversy. In 1956 she publicly\nopposed Oxford University\u2019s decision to award an honorary degree\nto Harry Truman, whom she considered a mass murderer for his decision\nto use atomic weapons against the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki,\nJapan. She also courted controversy with some of her colleagues\nby coming out in print against contraception (see below).</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe continued to produce original work beyond her\nretirement. Peter Geach, for example, reported in\n<em>Analysis</em> that she had constructed a novel paradox (Geach\n2006, 266\u20137).</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe died in Cambridge on 5 January 2001.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe met Wittgenstein at Cambridge, after her graduation from\nOxford. She attended his lectures and became one of his most\ndevoted students. She believed that it was Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlectures, for example, that freed her from the trap of phenomenalism\n(MPM, ix). When she returned to Oxford she continued to travel to\nCambridge to study with Wittgenstein.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe also became one of Wittgenstein\u2019s good friends and then,\nafter his death in 1951, one of the executors of his literary\nwork. Ray Monk wrote that Anscombe was \u201c\u2026one of\nWittgenstein\u2019s closest friends and one of his most trusted students,\nan exception to his general dislike of academic women and especially\nof female philosophers. She became, in fact, an honorary male,\naddressed by him affectionately as \u2018old man\u2019.\u201d (Monk\n1991, 498).</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe translated Wittgenstein\u2019s <em>Philosophical\nInvestigations</em> (1953), and wrote an introduction to the\n<em>Tractatus</em> in 1959 (the work had originally been published in\n1921). She organized major publications of Wittgenstein\u2019s\nlater work in, for example, <em>Remarks on Color</em> and\n<em>Zettel</em>. She also translated a number of his other works.</p>", "<p>\n\nSome of Anscombe\u2019s most influential work was on the nature of\ncausation. The relation between cause and effect has been\nnotoriously difficult to analyze. Anscombe\u2019s work in\n\u201cCausality and Determination\u201d challenged some of the\nempiricist orthodoxy of Hume\u2019s account. For example, she\nchallenged the view that the causal relation is characterized by\nconstant conjunction in discussing Feynman\u2019s Geiger counter\ncase:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\nAn example of a non-necessitating cause is mentioned by Feynman: a\nbomb is connected to a Geiger counter, so that it will go off if the\nGeiger counter registers a certain reading; whether it will or not is\nnot determined, for it is so placed near some radioactive material\nthat it may or may not register that reading. (255)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nAnd yet, if the bomb explodes it was caused by the Geiger counter\narrangement. Causation does not involve determination, or\nnecessity. Since the radioactive decay was not sufficient for\nthis effect, the case tells against viewing causes as sufficient\nconditions. There is no general causal connection between cause\nand effect.</p>", "<p>\n\nThis challenge to the Humean account would turn out to be very\ninfluential\u2014it helped push philosophers towards the development\nof probabilistic accounts of causation to account for the above type of\ncase.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn terms of categorization, she falls into the singularist camp on\ncausation, since she further rejected the Humean view that causation is\nnot observable in a single instance. On her view the particular cause\nproduces the particular effect. Anscombe produced examples from\nordinary language that seemed to show that we do perceive\ncausation. Such examples are abundant. \u201cI saw her\nclean the dishes\u201d reports the perception of a causal\nprocess. The critic could point out that when we utter\nexpressions such as this we are speaking loosely. Hume certainly\nwouldn\u2019t deny that we say things like this. Rather, the\nclose, probing, examination of a process alone cannot account for\ncausation.</p>", "<p>\n\nHer work on causation demonstrated reliance on ordinary language\nmethodology. Anscombe also directly contributed to the development of\nkey themes in ordinary language philosophy itself\u2014she influenced\nits content, not simply reliance on it methodologically. This is\nevident in her work on first-person expression. In her paper\n\u201cThe First Person\u201d she focuses on Descartes\u2019 use of\n\u2018I\u2019 in developing his philosophical arguments regarding\nthe existence of the self. On the same grounds as Descartes argues\nthat he can doubt \u2018I have a body\u2019 but cannot doubt\n\u2018I exist\u2019 he can doubt \u2018I am Descartes\u2019 but\nnot \u2018I exist.\u2019 \u2018I am Descartes\u2019, then, is not\nan identity statement.  \u2018I\u2019 does not refer like a\nname. In <em>doubting</em> \u201cI am Descartes\u201d he must have\nthe thought \u201cI am not Descartes.\u201d So, in using\n\u201cI,\u201d in this context he is not referring to himself.</p>", "<p>\n\nWe do tend to think of \u2018I\u2019 as simply being that\nexpression people use to refer to themselves. However,\nagain,</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n\u201cWhen John Smith spoke of James Robinson he was speaking of his\nbrother, but he did not know this.\u201d That\u2019s a possible\nsituation. So similarly is \u201cWhen John Smith spoke of John\nHoratio Auberon Smith (named in a will perhaps) he was speaking of\nhimself, but he did not know this.\u201d If so, then \u2018speaking\nof\u2019 or \u2018referring to\u2019 oneself is compatible with not\nknowing that the object one speaks of is oneself.  (47)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThe problem with the reference view of \u2018I\u2019 is that when\nsomeone is ignorant of his or her own identity, \u2018I\u2019 does\nnot capture what the person has in mind. When a person\n\u2018speaks of himself\u2019 when he says \u2018John drank the\npoison\u2019 not knowing that he himself is John, then he speaks of\nhimself in a purely external way, devoid of self-consciousness that we\nassociate with \u2018I\u2019 utterances. So \u2018John drank\nthe poison\u2019 does not come off as the same as \u2018I drank the\npoison\u2019\u2014John would affirm the first but not the\nsecond.</p>", "<p>\n\nAgain, this discussion of self-expression would have a great deal of\ninfluence in philosophy of language and mind. How indexicals work\nand function in language, the nature of self-knowledge and\nself-consciousness, and self-identity.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe\u2019s <em>Intention</em> (1957) is one of the classics of\n20<sup>th</sup> century philosophy. Indeed, it continues to be a\nstandard point of reference for those working in action theory and\nphilosophical psychology. Like Wittgenstein, Anscombe presented her\nideas in succinct points and numbered sections. However, Anscombe\ndeveloped her own distinctive approach to philosophical analysis.\nHer writing is more direct and argumentative than\nWittgenstein\u2019s.</p>", "<p>\n<em>Intention</em> is a work on the nature of agency through an\nunderstanding of intention. John Haldane reports that Anscombe wrote\n<em>Intention</em> after puzzling over supporters of Truman:</p>", "<blockquote>\nPerplexed by defenders of Truman she came to the conclusion that they\nhad failed to understand the nature of his actions, and it was this\nthat led her to write <em>Intention</em>, in which she pointed out\nthat in doing one thing (moving one\u2019s hand) one may\nintentionally be doing another (directing the death of human\nbeings). (Haldane, 2000, 1020)</blockquote>", "<p> Anscombe notes that \u2018intention\u2019 figures into our\nlanguage in a variety of ways, through different locutions. The three\nshe notes are:</p>", "<ol>\n\n<li><em>A</em> is <em>x</em>ing intentionally. [Adverb]</li>\n\n<li><em>A</em> is <em>x</em>ing with the intention of\ndoing <em>y</em>.  [Noun]</li>\n\n<li><em>A</em> intends to do <em>y</em>. [Verb]</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\n\nLocution (3) has to do with intention, and one of Anscombe\u2019s concerns\nwas to articulate the distinction between intention\n\u201c<em>simpliciter</em>\u201d and acting intentionally. One of\nthe really interesting questions she considers has to do with the\ndifference between intentions and predictions. Both are future\ndirected. Both seem to require a <em>belief</em> that a future state\nof affairs will occur. Yet, a crucial difference, it seems, is that\nwhen we justify a prediction\u2014such as \u201cIt will rain\ntomorrow\u201d we use evidence. On the other hand when we justify an\nintention, such as \u201cI will go to the ice cream shop\ntomorrow,\u201d we give reasons, i.e., \u201c\u2026reasons why it\nwould be useful or attractive if the description came true, not by\nevidence that it is true.\u201d (<em>Intention</em>, 6)</p>", "<p>\n\nThis passage raises some very deep issues regarding the nature of\nintention. For example, Anscombe seems to indicate that one kind\nof reason relates to the agent\u2019s <em>desires</em> for a certain\nstate of affairs. If I intend to do <em>y</em> must it be the case that I,\nall things considered, want <em>y</em> to come about; or merely that I all\nthings considered want to do <em>y</em>? Michael Bratman (1987) would\nquery this by noting that the belief/desire model of intention fails to\nadequately model the organizational role intentions play in practical\ndeliberation.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnother of her insights is that when we describe intentional action\nwe are pointing to something for which reasons can be given, and by\n\u2018reasons\u2019 we do not mean \u2018causes.\u2019 So,\nher example is that when someone knocks a glass off of a table he may\ngive an explanation that he saw a face in the window and that made him\njump. This provides a causal explanation for why he knocked the\nglass off the table, but it doesn\u2019t give a reason. The\nknocking of the glass off the table was not intentional, though it was\n<em>caused</em> by his being startled.</p>", "<p>\n\nOn Anscombe\u2019s view a particular action can be intentional\nunder one description, but not intentional under\nanother. When I turn on the coffee machine in the\nmorning it is intentional under the description of \u2018turn on the\ncoffee machine\u2019 that\u2019s what I intend to do. I will\nalso, let\u2019s say, as a side effect, get my husband to come into\nthe kitchen when he hears the coffee machine go on. That is not\nintentional though. The movement of my hand that turns on\nthe coffee machine is not intentional under the description \u2018get\nhusband to come into the kitchen.\u2019 For a bodily movement to\nbe an action it must be intentional under some description.</p>", "<p>\n\nFurther, on her view <em>intentional action</em> is prior to\n<em>intention to act</em>. That is, to understand what it is to\nintend to act one must understand intentional action. In\nperforming an intentional act we act on reasons (specified by\n\u2018why?\u2019 questions, as described above). Anscombe herself\nuses the example of someone who is sawing a plank. In sawing the\nplank his action is intentional under one description, that of\n\u2018sawing the plank,\u2019 though not under the description\n\u2018making noise.\u2019 So, he is intentionally sawing\nthe plank, though not intentionally making noise since he has no\nintention to make the noise (his reasons for performing the action have\nnothing to do with making noise). We get the claim that\nintentions are <em>necessary</em> for intentional action.\nNonetheless there can be unintentional action, but it will be\nintentional under some <em>other</em> description.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe\u2019s account of intention and intentional\naction has informed much of the subsequent literature on the\ntopic. Donald Davidson (1980) expanded on her claims regarding\nact identification and agreed that:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\nIf a person <em>F</em>s by <em>G</em>ing, then her act of\n<em>F</em>ing = her act of <em>G</em>ing.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThis is known as the Davidson/Anscombe thesis (Wilson, 1989; see also\nthe entry on <a href=\"../action/\">action</a>).  Davidson, however,\ndisagreed with Anscombe on the issue of reasons as causes. Davidson,\nunlike Anscombe, argued that reason explanation of an action is also a\nkind of causal explanation of the action.  When one explains an action\none cites the belief and the desire that caused the action. The\nreason, in the sense cited by Anscombe, corresponds to what the agent\ndesired. When I go to the ice cream shop to get an ice cream cone I\ndesire an ice cream cone and I believe that I can get one at the ice\ncream shop. This is what causes the intentional action of going to the\nice cream shop.</p>", "<p>\n\nGeorge Wilson follows Anscombe in that he too believes that an\nexplanation of an action in terms of the reasons for the action is\ngrounded in the intention behind the action (Wilson 1989). This will\nprove problematic when we look at the connection between philosophy of\npsychology and moral psychology.</p>", "<p>\n\nOne of the most significant ideas elaborated on in\n<em>Intention</em> is \u2018direction of fit.\u2019 Though the\nnotion seems to have originated with J.L. Austin, Anscombe is credited\nwith a clear explication of it. \u2018Direction of fit\u2019 was how\nJohn Searle referred to Anscombe\u2019s idea that there are two things\nthat we can do with words\u2014sometimes we try to get the\nwords to match, or fit with, what\u2019s in the world, and other times\nwe try to get the world to fit with the words. This turned out to\nbe important in speech act theory since speech acts exemplify one\ndirection of fit. When one utters a command, for example, one is\nnot trying to describe the world or make an assertion that is supposed\nto match with what is in the world. Rather, the point is to bring\nabout a state of affairs in the\n world.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-1\" id=\"ref-1\">1</a>]</sup></p>", "<p>\n\nConsider this famous passage from <em>Intention</em>:</p>", "<blockquote>Let us consider a man going round a town with a shopping\nlist in his hand. Now it is clear that the relation of this list to the\nthings he actually buys is one and the same whether his wife gave him\nthe list or it is his own list; and that there is a different relation\nwhere a list is made by a detective following him about. If he made the\nlist itself, it was an expression of intention; if his wife gave it to\nhim, it has the role of an order. What then is the identical relation\nto what happens, in the order and the intention, which is not shared by\nthe record? It is precisely this: if the list and the things that the\nman actually buys do not agree, and if this and this alone constitutes\na mistake, then the mistake is not in the list but in the man\u2019s\nperformance (if his wife were to say: \u201cLook, it says butter and\nyou have bought margarine\u201d, he would hardly reply: \u201cWhat a\nmistake! we must put that right\u201d and alter the word on the list\nto \u201cmargarine\u201d); whereas if the detective\u2019s record and what\nthe man actually buys do not agree, then the mistake is in the record.\n(section 32).</blockquote>", "<p>\n\n\u2018Direction-of-fit\u2019 has proven useful to understanding the difference\nbetween mental states like belief and desire. Beliefs describe the\nworld, desires are not descriptive. Desires effect change in the\nworld. Thus, desires themselves are not true or false, though they may\nbe based on beliefs which are true or false.  Thus intuitive way of\ndemarcating the function of belief and desire helps to clarify\ndifferent theories of normativity and what is at stake between those\ntheories. A desire based theory, for example, might not be committed\nto truth or falsity of moral claims.  This is important, too, in\naccounting for differences between speculative, or theoretical,\nknowledge and reasoning and practical knowledge and reasoning.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe applied her views on intention to clarify her own\npositions on controversial claims, such as the condemnation of\ncontraception. One puzzle in Catholic doctrine condemning\ncontraception, and yet allowing for the \u2018rhythm method\u2019 of\navoiding pregnancy, is to reconcile the rationales in a consistent\nway. Many charged the Church with inconsistency, since the\nintention to not get pregnant during intercourse is present in both\ncases. Anscombe claims the intentions differ.</p>", "<blockquote>\n\nThe reason why people are confused about intention, and why they\nsometimes think there is no difference between contraceptive\nintercourse and the use of infertile times to avoid conception, is\nthis: They don\u2019t notice the difference between \u201cintention\u201d\nwhen it means the intentionalness of the thing you\u2019re doing\u2014that\nyou\u2019re doing <em>this</em> on purpose\u2014and when it means\na <em>further</em> or <em>accompanying</em> intention <em>with</em>\nwhich you do the thing. (CC, 135)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nHer claim is that the further intentions that accompany these actions\nare the same, but that the kind of intentional act one is performing\nin each case differs in a very significant way. Her claim is that use\nof contraception, unlike timing intercourse to coincide with infertile\nperiods, is a bad sort of action because in the case of sexual\nintercourse \u201c\u2026to intend such an act is not to intend a\nmarriage act at all, whether or no we\u2019re married\u201d (CC, 136). When one\nengages in sexual intercourse using contraceptives one has the\nintention of rendering oneself infertile, one is not acting with the\nintention of engaging in normal sexual intercourse, just at an\ninfertile time. Even though both types of action have the further aim\nof limiting family size, the basic intentions are different. That is,\nthe intentions that define the acts themselves are different. The\nperversion of the sex act in marriage is, in this one way, like\nwriting a forged check for a good cause, she claims. The further\nintention of, let\u2019s say, helping the needy is a worthy one but does\nnot vindicate the action of forging the check. Needless to say, this\nview was enormously controversial.</p>", "<p>\n\nBernard Williams and Michael Tanner criticized her argument\nfor failing to consider one of her own theses\u2014that actions,\nincluding sorts of actions, can fall under a variety of\ndescriptions. On their view, she is picking and choosing\ndescriptions of actions in order to get the outcome she wants\u2014a\ndistinction between rhythm method and contraception that isn\u2019t\njust a trivial distinction. But, they argue, she cannot do this\nconvincingly. They argue that couples who employ the rhythm\nmethod are taking steps to achieve infertility just as those who take\ncontraception are. Those steps are central to understanding the\nacts themselves, not simply the further purpose of the acts. (Williams\nand Tanner 1972)</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe\u2019s views on intention also figured largely in her defense and\narticulation of the Doctrine of Double Effect, which will be discussed\nin more detail below.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe\u2019s article \u201cModern Moral Philosophy\u201d\nstimulated the development of virtue ethics as an alternative to\nUtilitarianism, Kantian Ethics, and Social Contract theories. Her\nprimary charge in the article is that, as secular approaches to moral\ntheory, they are without foundation. They use concepts such as\n\u2018morally ought,\u2019 \u2018morally obligated,\u2019\n\u2018morally right,\u2019 and so forth that are legalistic and\nrequire a legislator as the source of moral authority. In the\npast God occupied that role, but systems that dispense with God as part\nof the theory are lacking the proper foundation for meaningful\nemployment of those concepts.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere are two ways to read this article. The first is to read it\nstraightforwardly as an indictment of the moral theories prevalent in\nthe 1950s and a subsequent argument for the development of an\nalternative theory of morality that does not postulate a legislator,\nbut then also does not try to keep the defunct legislative structure\nthat naturally falls out of religiously based ethics. On this view we\nneed to develop an alternative that is based on moral psychology,\nmoral virtue, facts of human nature, and an account of the good for\nhumans based on this approach. A major mistake made by modern moral\nphilosophers is that they try to provide an account of \u2018morally\nright or morally wrong\u2019 that really has no content outside of\nthe legislative arena provided by the divine. Anscombe writes:\n\u201cIt would be most reasonable to drop it. It has no reasonable\nsense outside a law conception of ethics; they are not going to\nmaintain such a conception; and you can do ethics without it, as is\nshown by the example of Aristotle. It would be great improvement if,\ninstead of \u2018morally wrong,\u2019 one always named a genus such\nas \u2018untruthful\u2019, \u2018unchaste\u2019,\n\u2018unjust\u2019\u2009\u201d (MMP, 8\u20139).</p>", "<p>\n\nThus, many take her to be arguing for this alternative\u2014the\nalternative that, like Aristotle\u2019s account, relies on richer, or\n\u2018thick\u2019 concepts such as \u2018just\u2019 as opposed to\n\u2018thin\u2019 concepts such as \u2018morally wrong\u2019\nwhich\u2014outside of a certain metaphysical perspective\u2014lacks\ncontent.</p>", "<p>\n\nThis quite naturally then leads to an emphasis on developing a\nvirtue ethics that would be distinct from the modern approaches\nAnscombe attacks in MMP.</p>", "<p>\n\nThis is the prevalent reading of MMP and the reason why it is widely\ninterpreted as encouraging a virtue ethical approach to moral\ntheory. For example, Crisp and Slote note that Anscombe suggests\nthe alternative that \u201c\u2026ethics can be based, instead, on\nthe idea of a virtue\u2026\u201d, but, as they also note, this idea\nitself is also not clear and that what we need to be doing is some\nbasic moral psychology to get clarity on notions such as\n\u2018intention,\u2019 \u2018desire,\u2019 \u2018action,\u2019\nand so forth (1997, 4). Yet another crucial notion, for the sake\nof understanding virtue, is \u2018human flourishing.\u2019\nAnscombe is doubtful we will be able to reach a satisfactory\nunderstanding of this notion.</p>", "<p>\n\nAn alternative reading is as a <em>modus tollens</em> argument\nintended to establish the superiority of a religious based ethics. (For\nmore on a skeptical reading of MMP, see Crisp 2004.) Assume for the\nsake of argument there is no God, and religiously based moral theory is\nincorrect. On Anscombe\u2019s view modern theories such as\nKantian ethics, Utilitarianism, and social contract theory are sorely\ninadequate for a variety of reasons, but one major worry is that they\ntry to adopt the legalistic framework without the right background\nassumptions to ground it. An alternative would be to develop a\nkind of naturalized approach where we carefully consider moral\npsychology as it relates to the human good. However, this\napproach itself is problematic. The prospect of articulating a\ncomplete and plausible account of the human good along these lines is\ndim.</p>", "<p>\n\nHere is the straightforward interpretation in simple <em>modus\nponens</em> form:</p>", "<table class=\"indent vert-top cellpad-medium\">\n<tr>\n<td>(1)</td>\n<td>If religiously based ethics is false, then virtue ethics is the\nway moral philosophy ought to be developed.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>(2a)</td>\n<td>Religious based ethics is false (at least for\nher interlocutors)</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>(3a)</td>\n<td>Therefore, virtue ethics is the way moral philosophy should be\ndeveloped.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>", "<p>\n\nBut one person\u2019s <em>modus ponens</em> is another\nperson\u2019s <em>modus tollens</em>:</p>", "<table class=\"indent vert-top cellpad-medium\">\n<tr>\n<td>(1)</td>\n<td>If religiously based ethics is false, then virtue ethics is the\nway moral philosophy ought to be developed.</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>(2b)</td>\n<td>It is not the case that virtue ethics is the way to develop\nmoral philosophy</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>(3b)</td>\n<td>Therefore, it is not the case that religiously based ethics is\nfalse.</td>\n</tr>\n</table>", "<p>\n\nThus, according to the alternative reading, one can conclude that\nAnscombe is arguing that the only suitable and really viable\nalternative is the religiously based moral theory that keeps the\nlegalistic framework and the associated concepts of\n\u2018obligation.\u2019 This interpretation is more in keeping with\nAnscombe\u2019s religious views and with her other ethical views\nregarding absolute prohibitions. There were plenty of actions she\ntook to be morally wrong, so it seems clear\u2014as Simon Blackburn\nnoted\u2014that she herself was not out to jettison these\nterms. But one can defend an even stronger claim. MMP is a\ncarefully crafted argument intended to show the absurdity of rejecting\nthe religious framework\u2014along with it\u2019s metaphysical\nunderpinnings\u2014when it comes to moral\n authority.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-2\" id=\"ref-2\">2</a>]</sup>\nBut many readers simply\nstuck to the straightforward <em>modus ponens</em> reading of the\nargument. Support for (2b) is provided by her doubts that\nvirtue ethics can really get off the ground as a normative theory using\na distinctly \u2018moral\u2019 ought. In MMP she writes about\npursuing the project of ethics as Plato and Aristotle pursued it, along\nvirtue ethical lines:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\n\u2026but it can be seen that philosophically there is a huge gap,\nat present unfillable as far as we are concerned, which needs to be\nfilled by an account of human nature, human action, the type of\ncharacteristic a virtue is, and, above all of human\n\u2018flourishing\u2019. And it is the last concept that appears the\nmost doubtful. (MMP, 41)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nBut, by and large, MMP was read against a backdrop in which a\nreligious basis for ethics had been discredited. Thus many\nwriters took up the challenge to develop a psychologically rich virtue\nethics rather than abandon secular morality.</p>", "<p>\n\nThe article has clearly had an impact on the development of virtue\nethics. Part of its influence can be traced to its negative\nassessment of the leading theories of the day, particularly\nUtilitarianism and Kantian Ethics. On her view,\nUtilitarianism commits one to endorsing evil deeds, and Kantian ethics,\nwith its notion of \u2018self-legislation\u2019 is just\nincoherent. If the main choices are either evil or incoherent,\nthat\u2019s a serious problem and calls for the development of some\nalternative approach. Unfortunately, perhaps, for\nAnscombe\u2019s overall project, her audience regarded the\nsupernaturalized approach as more problematic than the naturalized . If\nwe are to go back to very early approaches, such as Aristotle\u2019s,\nthen the natural approach to developing the alternatives is as a\n\u2018virtue ethics\u2019 and digging into the messy issue of human\nflourishing and good.</p>", "<p>\n\nMMP also touched a nerve with philosophers who advocated one or the\nother of the condemned views. One reason for this was the rather\ndismissive or moralistic tone she took in some of her criticisms.\nPerhaps one of the more well known is given in the following passage\nwhen she condemns Utilitarianism\u2014or, more\ngenerally\u2014Consequentialism, for leaving open the possibility\nthat it may be morally right in some context to advocate the execution\nof an innocent person.</p>", "<p>\n\nShe wrote:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\nBut if someone really thinks, <em>in advance</em>, that it is open to\nquestion whether such an action as procuring the judicial execution of\nthe innocent should be quite excluded from consideration\u2014I do\nnot want to argue with him; he shows a corrupt\nmind. (MMP, 17)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe is not making a subtle point here, and this comment prodded\nphilosophers such as Jonathan Bennett to defend the view that\nconsequences certainly <em>mattered</em> in determining the moral\nquality of an action\u2014indeed, he questions the adequacy of\naccounts that rely on a dubious act/consequence distinction. This does\nnot by itself get one to Consequentialism. Indeed, Anscombe\u2019s comment\nhere goes beyond a mere condemnation of Consequentialism to a further\ncondemnation of any view in which consequences are weighed in\ndetermining moral rightness or wrongness. She is a moral\nabsolutist. Some things are wrong and ought not to be done, whatever\nthe consequences. So, for example, Bennett was concerned to undercut a\npopular distinction between killing versus letting die which was made\non the basis that killing is just the sort of act that is wrong,\nperiod, no matter what the consequences, whereas letting die is not as\nbad as killing, even if the consequences were the same and were known\nto be the same.</p>", "<blockquote>\n\nWhen the killing/letting-die distinction is stripped of its\nimplications regarding immediacy, intention <em>etc</em>.\u2014which\nlack moral significance or don\u2019t apply to the example\u2014all that\nremains is a distinction having to do with where a set of movements\nlies on the scale which has \u2018the only set of movements which\nwould have produced that upshot\u2019 at one end and \u2018movements\nother than the only set which would have produced that upshot\u2019\nat the other. (Bennett 1966, 95)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThus, a person\u2019s doing <em>a</em> results in an upshot <em>x</em> and\nat one end of the action scale <em>a</em> is the one action that can\nresult in <em>x</em>; refraining from <em>a</em> is compatible with a whole\nrange of alternative actions\u2014walking to the grocery store,\nweeding in the garden, reading a book\u2014all of which\nhave <em>x</em> as a result.  But there is no morally relevant\ndifference, here. There is nothing in the \u2018act itself\u2019 of\nkilling that distinguishes it, in a morally relevant way, from letting\ndie when things like immediacy, intention, and so forth are held\nconstant.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe\u2019s comment on Bennett\u2019s criticism comprises one of the\nbriefest philosophical essays, which I quote in its entirety here:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\nThe nerve of Mr. Bennett\u2019s argument is that if A results from your not\ndoing B, then A results from whatever you do instead of doing B. While\nthere may be much to be said for this view, still it does not seem\nright on the face of it. (Anscombe, 1966)</blockquote>", "<p>\nAside from the profound problem of commending vicious acts, Anscombe\nalso believed that consequentialism failed to capture, indeed, must\nfail to capture, crucial elements of moral psychology.  The theory\ncannot account for backward looking justifications, or reasons, for\nperforming certain actions. Teichmann notes, in his work on Anscombe,\nthat, though it seems superficially intuitive that reasons are\nunderstood in causal terms, this does not, in Anscombe\u2019s opinion,\nwithstand scrutiny. In response to \u201cWhy did you kill him?\u201d\n(using Anscombe\u2019s own example), Teichmann holds that though one\nintuitive reason might be \u201cIn order to get revenge\u201d, it is\nalso the case, in Anscombe\u2019s view, \u201c\u2026the sense of\n\u2018In order to get revenge\u2019 in fact presupposes the force of\nsuch reasons as \u2018Because he killed my brother\u2019, and\nnot <em>vice versa</em>\u201d (Teichmann, 124).</p>", "<p>\nThe absolutist stance informed a good deal of her other work in moral\nphilosophy. In her famous pamphlet <em>Mr. Truman\u2019s Degree</em>\n(1958), Anscombe protested Oxford\u2019s decision to award Harry Truman an\nhonorary doctorate. Her view was that Truman murdered large numbers of\ninnocent persons, civilians, with nuclear weapons in order to get\nJapan to surrender. On her view, the end does not justify the\nmeans. It is not permissible to kill innocents for the sake of some\ngreater good to be realized as a consequence of such action. Some,\nthough it is worth pointing out not all, consequentialists will\ndisagree that such cases are just out of the question (and many\nstraightforward consequentialists could well agree that Truman was not\nan example of someone using means/end reasoning in a justifiable way).\nAnscombe\u2019s discussion, though, informed later discussions of absolute\nprohibitions in wartime such as Thomas Nagel\u2019s discussion of the\nattractive features of the absolutist position in \u201cWar and\nMassacre\u201d (1972).</p>", "<p> Anscombe\u2019s work in ethics dovetailed, in many ways, with the\nwork of contemporaries Philippa Foot and Iris Murdoch.  All were\nopposed to Utilitarianism, and were suspicious of the\n\u2019thin\u2019 evaluative terms that were adopted by the\ntheory. Of course, this criticism was not restricted to\nUtilitarianism.  Any theory predominantly employing thin moral\nconcepts such as \u2019right\u2019 and \u2019wrong\u2019 were\nsubject to this line of criticism.  Thin moral concepts are opposed to\n\u2019thick\u2019 ones.  Bernard Williams famously characterized\nthick concepts this way:</p>", "<blockquote> If a concept of this kind applies, this often provides\nsomeone with a reason for action \u2026 We may say, summarily, that\nsuch concepts are \u201caction-guiding.\u201d \u2026 At the same\ntime, their application is guided by the world.  A concept of this\nsort may be rightly or wrongly applied, and people who have acquired\nit can agree that it applies or fails to apply to some new\nsituation...We can say, then, that the application of these concepts\nis at the same time world-guided and action-guiding. (Williams, 1985,\n140\u20131)</blockquote>", "<p> Virtue terms are thick. To describe an action as\n\u2019cowardly\u2019 provides much more information than to describe\nit as \u2019wrong\u2019. Further, thin terms can lead us astray. In\nMMP, after describing the Utilitarian commitment to be open, in\nprinciple, to \u201c\u2026 judicially punishing a man for what he is\nclearly understood not to have done \u2026\u201d, which is clearly\n\u2019unjust\u2019, she writes:</p>", "<blockquote> And here we see the superiority of the term\n\u2018unjust\u2019 over the terms \u2018morally right\u2019 and\n\u2018morally wrong\u2019.  For in the context of English moral\nphilosophy since Sidgwick it appears legitimate to discuss whether it\nmight be \u2018morally right\u2019 in some circumstances to adopt that\nprocedure; but it cannot be argued that the procedure would in any\ncircumstances be just. (MMP, 16)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe also defended a version of the doctrine of double effect, and\nher commitment to this Doctrine provided a principle she used to try\nto show what was corrupt about Truman\u2019s action. The basic idea is that\nthere is a morally relevant distinction between intended versus merely\nforeseen outcomes. To intend harm is worse than to merely foresee harm\nas a result of one\u2019s action.  This can sometimes be combined with a\nkind of absolutism to hold that intended harms are forbidden whereas\nthe merely foreseen may not be. It is frequently used to try to\nunderwrite a moral distinction between a strategic bomber and a terror\nbomber. What a strategic bomber does in dropping a bomb may be\npermissible because he does not intend to kill innocent civilians even\nthough he foresees that they will die as a result of the bombing. A\nterror bomber, on the other hand, does intend to kill innocent\ncivilians as a way to achieve his aims.</p>", "<p>\n\nAnscombe\u2019s own position varied somewhat over the course of her\ncareer.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn \u201cWar and Murder,\u201d published in 1961, Anscombe notes that\nthe moral permissibility of coercive authority requires a principle\nthat can be used to differentiate the just imposition of harms from\nthe unjust. The Doctrine of Double Effect is one such principle. At\nthe root of the principle is the distinction between intended and\nforeseen consequences of an action. While there is some debate on the\ncorrect specification of the Doctrine, the basic idea is that it is\nworse to intend harm than to merely foresee it. In Anscombe\u2019s opinion,\nsome actions are absolutely forbidden because they involve intentions\nto harm whereas if the harm in question was merely foreseen the action\nwould not be forbidden.</p>", "<p>\n\nBut she was also concerned that the Doctrine of Double Effect was\noften abused. For example, one constraint on the Doctrine holds\nthat one cannot intend the means to the desired end. So, a doctor\nmay administer a drug to alleviate pain though knowing that another\neffect of the drug will be the death of the patient. This is\npermitted. One way to understand how this works is by employing a\ncounterfactual test\u2014if the doctor could alleviate the pain of\nthe patient without administering such strong medication she\nwould. What is not permitted by Double Effect is using the bad\neffect as a means to achieving one\u2019s goal.</p>", "<p>\n\nSome have held the view that one can direct one\u2019s intentions a certain\nway to achieve the desired result with moral impunity. If, for\nexample, one tells oneself that one is only intending <em>x</em> by\ndoing <em>y</em>, then one is off the hook even if <em>y</em> is\nimmoral\u2014and this strikes Anscombe as quite absurd. Her example\nis that of a servant who holds the ladder for his master who is a\nthief and justifies it by telling himself that his intention is simply\nto avoid getting fired. Holding the ladder is his means of avoiding\nthe loss of his job. It is still immoral. Because of the means/end\nconstraint on Double Effect, holding the ladder is not justified. And\nthis misunderstanding of Double Effect was at the basis of Anscombe\u2019s\nproblem with wartime bombing and the flagrant misuse of Double Effect\nto justify it.</p>", "<blockquote>\n\nThe devout Catholic bomber secures by a \u201cdirection of\nintention\u201d that any shedding of innocent blood that occurs is\n\u201caccidental.\u201d I know a Catholic boy who was puzzled at\nbeing told by his schoolmaster that it was an <em>accident</em> that\nthe people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were there to be killed; in fact,\nhowever absurd it seems, such thoughts are common among priests who\nknow that they are forbidden by the divine law to justify the direct\nkilling of the innocent. (WM, 59)</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nAgain, in order to employ DDE one needs the distinction between\nintended and merely foreseen consequences of the \u2018act\nitself.\u2019 On Anscombe\u2019s view some actions are in and of\nthemselves immoral, regardless of the consequences one intends to bring\nabout in the performance of the action, and certainly regardless of\nwhat one foresees as a result of the action. But many\n<em>consequentialists</em> don\u2019t recognize a morally relevant\ndistinction between intention and foresight. Jonathan Bennett,\nfor example, was highly critical of this distinction.</p>", "<p>\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that it can be extremely difficult to parse\ndouble effect. It is often presented in the following way.\nThere is an action that the agent performs which has two effects, one\ngood, one bad. The action may still be permissible given that the\nintended effect that is desired by the agent is good, and given that\nthe bad effect is merely foreseen, and not intended. It appears\nthat the agent voluntarily chooses both effects, but is only fully\naccountable for one. And this strikes some as odd, since it just\nseems obvious that foreseen consequences have to be weighed\u2014it\nwould be irresponsible not to weigh them. So surely they count\ntoo?</p>", "<p>\n\nBut Joseph Boyle makes a maneuver that might help Anscombe\nhere. He argues that the unintended effect is not voluntarily\n<em>chosen</em> (in the morally relevant sense of \u2018chosen\u2019\nfor which we hold people responsible) even though the agent knows that\nit will occur as a result of his actions.  The reason for Boyle is\nthat the foreseen consequences\u2014though definitely factored into\ndeliberation\u2014are not factored in the right way to count as\nvoluntarily <em>chosen</em>. The foreseen effects are not reasons for\naction; rather, as Boyle notes, \u201c\u2026they are sometimes\nconditions <em>in spite of which</em> one acts\u201d (1980,\n535). We can consider another of Anscombe\u2019s famous cases to\nillustrate this. Anscombe publicly protested Oxford University\u2019s\nawarding to an honorary degree to Harry Truman. Truman, on her view,\nwas a mass murderer. As we noted earlier, she was disgusted by the\nattempts of some individuals to excuse Truman by using double\neffect. Truman, she argued, dropped the bomb on those\ncities, <em>not</em> in spite of the civilian population, but at least\nin part because of that population. He could have chosen an isolated\nlocation for a demonstration. There was evidence that the Japanese did\nwant to negotiate. On Anscombe\u2019s view Truman was using the innocent\ncivilians of Hiroshima and Nagasaki to achieve his ends. She believed\nthat their presence entered into his deliberation as a positive\nfactor, not as a detracting factor. This, then, would be a case of\nterror bombing, and of outright murder.</p>", "<p>\n\nWhile it is true that there is a big difference between terror bombing\nand strategic bombing, some question, however, that DDE accounts for\nthat difference. One might argue that to the extent Truman desired the\nevil outcome of the deaths of innocent civilians what he did was\nmurder. This does not rely on acceptance of DDE to account for a\ndifference. Jonathan Bennett points out that it can be really\ndifficult to parse a meaningful difference using DDE. For example, the\ncounterfactual test so many proponents of DDE use doesn\u2019t work to\ndistinguish the terror from the strategic cases. As Bennett notes,\n\u201cThe tactical bomber\u2019s wish for the civilian deaths is a\nreluctant one: if he could, he would destroy the factory without\nkilling civilians. But the terror bomber too, if he could, would drop\nhis bombs in such a way as to lower enemy morale without killing\ncivilians\u201d (Bennett 1995, 222).  If Truman wanted to kill\ncivilians, what he did was wrong, but not\n<em>because of</em> a violation of DDE. It was wrong because he\nintentionally and knowingly caused immense suffering that could have\nbeen avoided through an alternative course of action. Of course, one\ncould still argue that DDE is a very useful heuristic\u2014it tracks\njustification even if it doesn\u2019t itself underwrite that\njustification. However, even this picture of DDE has been attacked by\nresearchers studying our reactions to moral dilemma cases, who hold\nthat we do not consciously employ anything like DDE in making moral\ndecisions (Greene, <i>et al</i>., 2009).</p>", "<p>\n\nG. E. M. Anscombe\u2019s work ranged over many years and many\ndifferent areas in philosophy. The breadth of her work is\nimpressive. She was systematic in her thinking, seeing and\ndeveloping connections between metaphysics, moral psychology, and\nethics that exhibited not simply a grasp of one particular\nproblem, but a world view. Her legacy is one of the broadest and\ndeepest left by a 20<sup>th</sup> century philosopher.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "anscombe"]}

His father, Alexander, a headmaster of\na secondary school for girls, and his mother, Auguste (nee\nBialloblotzky), brought him up in the Lutheran faith. Frege attended\nthe local <em>Gymnasium</em> for 15 years, and after graduation in 1869,\nentered the University of Jena (see Frege 1874, translation in\nMcGuinness (ed.) 1984, 92).</p>", "<p>At Jena, Frege attended lectures by Ernst Karl Abbe, who\nsubsequently became Frege\u2019s mentor and who had a significant\nintellectual and personal influence on Frege\u2019s life.  Frege\ntransferred to the University of G\u00f6ttingen in 1871, and two years\nlater, in 1873, was awarded a Ph.D. in mathematics, having written a\ndissertation under Ernst Schering titled <em>\u00dcber eine\ngeometrische Darstellung der imagin\u00e4ren Gebilde in der Ebene</em>\n(\u201cOn a Geometrical Representation of Imaginary Forms in the\nPlane\u201d). Frege explains the project in his thesis as follows:\n\u201cBy a geometrical representation of imaginary forms in the plane\nwe understand accordingly a kind of correlation in virtue of which\nevery real or imaginary element of the plane has a real, intuitive\nelement corresponding to it\u201d (Frege 1873, translation in\nMcGuinness (ed.)  1984, 3).  Here, by \u2018imaginary\nforms\u2019, Frege is referring to imaginary points, imaginary curves\nand lines, etc.  Interestingly, one section of the thesis concerns the\nrepresentation of complex numbers by magnitudes of angles in the\nplane.</p>", "<p>In 1874, Frege completed his <em>Habilitationsschrift</em>,\nentitled <em>Rechnungsmethoden</em>, <em>die sich auf eine Erweiterung\ndes Gr\u00f6ssenbegriffes gr\u00fcnden</em> (\u201cMethods of\nCalculation Based on an Extension of the Concept of Quantity\u201d).\nImmediately after submitting this thesis, the good offices of\nAbbe led Frege to become a <em>Privatdozent</em> (Lecturer) at\nthe University of Jena.  Library records from the University of Jena\nestablish that, over the next 5 years, Frege checked out texts in\nmechanics, analysis, geometry, Abelian functions, and elliptical\nfunctions (Kreiser 1984, \n 21).<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-1\" id=\"ref-1\">1</a>]</sup> \n No doubt, many of these texts helped him to\nprepare the lectures he is listed as giving by the University of Jena\ncourse bulletin, for these lectures are on topics that often match the\ntexts, i.e., analytic geometry, elliptical and Abelian functions,\nalgebraic analysis, functions of complex variables, etc. (Kratzsch\n1979).<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-2\" id=\"ref-2\">2</a>]</sup></p>", "<p>This course of Frege\u2019s reading and lectures during the period of\n1874\u20131879 dovetailed quite naturally with the interests he\ndisplayed in his <em>Habilitationsschrift</em>. The \u2018extension\nof the concept of quantity\u2019 referred to in the title concerns\nthe fact that our understanding of quantities (e.g., lengths,\nsurfaces, etc.)  has to be extended in the context of complex\nnumbers.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-3\" id=\"ref-3\">3</a>]</sup> He\nsays, right at the beginning of this work:</p>", "<blockquote>\n According to the old conception, length appears as something material\nwhich fills the straight line between its end points and at the same\ntime prevents another thing from penetrating into its space by its\nrigidity. In adding quantities, we are therefore forced to place one\nquantity against another.  Something similar holds for surfaces and\nsolid contents. The introduction of negative quantities made a dent in\nthis conception, and imaginary quantities made it completely\nimpossible. Now all that matters is the point of origin and the end\npoint \u2013 the idea of filling the space has been completely\nlost. All that has remained is certain general properties of addition,\nwhich now emerge as the essential characteristic marks of quantity.\nThe concept has thus gradually freed itself from intuition and made\nitself independent. This is quite unobjectionable, especially since\nits earlier intuitive character was at bottom mere appearance.\nBounded straight lines and planes enclosed by curves can certainly be\nintuited, but what is quantitative about them, what is common to\nlengths and surfaces, escapes our intuition. \u2026 There is\naccordingly a noteworthy difference between geometry and arithmetic in\nthe way in which their fundamental principles are grounded. The\nelements of all geometrical constructions are intuitions, and geometry\nrefers to intuition as the source of its axioms. Since the object of\narithmetic does not have an intuitive character, its fundamental\npropositions cannot stem from intuition\u2026 (Frege 1874,\ntranslation in McGuinness (ed.) 1984, 56)\n </blockquote>", "<p>Here we can see the beginning of two lifelong interests of Frege,\nnamely, (1) in how concepts and definitions developed for one domain\nfare when applied in a wider domain, and (2) in the contrast between\nlegitimate appeals to intuition in geometry and illegitimate appeals\nto intuition in the development of pure number theory. Indeed, some\nrecent scholars have (a) shown how Frege\u2019s work in logic was informed\nin part by his understanding of the analogies and disanalogies between\ngeometry and number theory (Wilson 1992), and (b) shown that Frege was\nintimately familiar with the division among late 19th century\nmathematicians doing complex analysis who split over whether it is\nbetter to use the analytic methods of Weierstrass or the intuitive\ngeometric methods of Riemann (Tappenden 2006). Weierstrass\u2019s 1872\npaper, describing a real-valued function that is continuous\neverywhere but differentiable \n nowhere,<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-4\" id=\"ref-4\">4</a>]</sup>\n was well known and provided an example of an ungraphable functions\nthat places limits on intuition. Yet, at the same time, Frege clearly\naccepted Riemann\u2019s practice and methods derived from taking functions\nas fundamental, as opposed to Weierstrass\u2019s focus on functions that\ncan be represented or analyzed in terms of other mathematical objects\n(e.g., complex power series).</p>", "<p>In 1879, Frege published his first book <em>Begriffsschrift, eine\nder arithmetischen nachgebildete Formelsprache des reinen Denkens</em>\n(<em>Concept Notation: A formula language of pure thought, modelled\nupon that of arithmetic</em>) and was promoted\nto <em>au\u00dferordentlicher Professor</em> (Extraordinarius Professor)\nat Jena.  Although the <em>Begriffsschrift</em> constituted a major\nadvance in logic, it was neither widely understood nor well-received.\nSome scholars have suggested that this was due to the facts that the\nnotation was 2-dimensional instead of linear and that he didn\u2019t build\nupon the work of others but rather presented something radically new\n(e.g., Mendelsohn 2005, 2).  Though our discussion below is framed\nprimarily with an eye towards the system Frege developed in his\ntwo-volume work of 1893/1903 (<em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em>),\nthe principal elements of this later system can be found already in\nthe <em>Begriffsschrift</em> of 1879.</p>", "<p>Frege\u2019s next really significant work was his second book,\n<em>Die Grundlagen der Arithmetik: eine logisch mathematische\nUntersuchung \u00fcber den Begriff der Zahl</em>, published in\n1884. Frege begins this work with criticisms of previous attempts to\ndefine the concept of number, and then offers his own\nanalysis. The <em>Grundlagen</em> contains a variety of insights still\ndiscussed today, such as: (a) the claim that a statement of number\n(e.g., \u2018there are eight planets\u2019) is a higher-order\nassertion about a concept (see Section 2.5 below); (b) his famous\nContext Principle (\u201cnever ask for the meaning of a word in\nisolation, but only in the context of a proposition\u201d), and (c)\nthe formulation of a principle (now called \u2018Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple\u2019 in the secondary literature) that asserts the\nequivalence of the claim \u201cthe number of <em>F</em>s is equal to\nthe number of <em>G</em>s\u201d with the claim that \u201cthere is a\none-to-one correspondence between the objects falling under <em>F</em>\nand the objects falling under <em>G</em>\u201d (see Section 2.5 below).\nMore generally, Frege provides in the <em>Grundlagen</em> a\nnon-technical philosophical justification and outline of the ideas\nthat he was to develop technically in his two-volume\nwork <em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em> (1893/1903).</p>", "<p>In the years 1891\u20131892, Frege published three of his most\nwell-known papers, \u2018Function and Concept\u2019 (1891),\n\u2018On Sense and Reference\u2019 (1892a), and \u2018On Concept\nand Object\u2019 (1892b). Immediately after that, in 1893, he\npublished the first volume of the technical work previously\nmentioned, <em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik</em>.  In 1896, he was\npromoted to <em>ordentlicher Honorarprofessor</em> (regular honorary\nprofessor).  Six years later (on June 16, 1902), as he was preparing\nthe proofs of the second volume of the <em>Grundgesetze</em>, he\nreceived a letter from Bertrand Russell, informing him that one could\nderive a contradiction in the system he had developed in the first\nvolume.  Russell\u2019s letter frames the paradox first in terms of\nthe predicate <em>P</em> = \u2018being a predicate which cannot be predicated\nof itself\u2019, and then in terms of the class of all those classes\nthat are not members of themselves.  Frege, in the Appendix to\nthe second volume, rephrased the paradox in terms of his own \nsystem. </p>", "<p>\nFrege never fully recovered from the fatal flaw discovered in the\nfoundations of his <em>Grundgesetze</em>.  His attempts at salvaging\nthe work by restricting Basic Law V were not successful. However, he\ncontinued teaching at Jena, and from 1903\u20131917, he published six\npapers, including \u2018What is a Function?\u2019 (1904) and\n\u2018On the Foundations of Geometry\u2019 (Frege 1903b and 1906).\nIn the latter, Frege criticized Hilbert\u2019s understanding and use of the\naxiomatic method (see the entry on the\n  <a href=\"../frege-hilbert/\">Frege-Hilbert controversy</a>). From\nthis time period, we have the lecture notes that Rudolf Carnap took as\na student in two of his courses (see Reck and Awodey 2004). In 1917,\nhe retired from the University of Jena.</p>", "<p>In the last phase of Frege\u2019s life, from 1917\u20131925, Frege\npublished three philosophical papers, in a series, with the titles\n\u2018The Thought\u2019, \u2018Negation\u2019, and \u2018Compound\nThoughts\u2019 (Frege 1918a, 1918b, and 1923, respectively).  After\nthat, however, we have only fragments of philosophical works.\nUnfortunately, his last years saw him become more than just\npolitically conservative and right-wing \u2013 his diary for a brief\nperiod in 1924 show sympathies for fascism and anti-Semitism (see\nFrege 1924 [1996], translated by R. Mendelsohn).  He died on July 26,\n1925, in Bad Kleinen (now in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern).</p>", "<p>\n\nFrege provided a foundations for the modern discipline of logic by\ndeveloping a more perspicuous method of formally representing the\nlogic of thoughts and inferences. He did this by developing: (a) a\nsystem allowing one to study inferences formally, (b) an analysis of\ncomplex sentences and quantifier phrases that showed an underlying\nunity to certain classes of inferences, (c) an analysis\nof <em>proof</em> and <em>definition</em>, (d) a theory of extensions\nwhich, though seriously flawed, offered an intriguing picture of the\nfoundations of mathematics, (e) an analysis of statements about number\n(i.e., of answers to the question \u2018How many?\u2019), (f)\ndefinitions and proofs of some of the basic axioms of number theory\nfrom a limited set of logically primitive concepts and axioms, and (g)\na conception of logic as a discipline which has some compelling\nfeatures. We discuss these developments in the following\nsubsections.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn an attempt to realize Leibniz\u2019s ideas for a universal formal\nlanguage and a rational calculus, Frege developed a formal notation\nfor regimenting thought and reasoning. Though this notation was first\noutlined in his <em>Begriffsschrift</em> (1879), the most mature\nstatement of Frege\u2019s system was in his 2-volume <em>Grundgesetze der\nArithmetik</em> (1893/1903). Frege\u2019s two systems are best\ncharacterized as term logics, since all of the complete expressions\nare denoting terms. Frege analyzed ordinary predication in these\nsystems, and so they can also be conceived as predicate calculi. A\npredicate calculus is a formal system (a formal language and a method\nof proof) in which one can represent valid inferences among\npredications, i.e., among statements in which properties are\npredicated of objects.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn this subsection, we shall examine the most basic elements of\nFrege\u2019s 1893/1903 term logic and predicate calculus. These are the\nstatements involving function applications and the simple predications\nwhich fall out as a special case.</p>", "<h4>2.1.1 The Basis of Frege\u2019s Term Logic</h4>", "<p>\n\nIn Frege\u2019s term logic, all of the terms and well-formed formulas\nare denoting expressions. These include: (a) simple names of objects,\nlike \u2018\\(2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(\\pi\\)\u2019, (b) complex terms\nwhich denote objects, like \u2018\\(2^2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(3 +\n1\\)\u2019, and (c) sentences (which are also complex terms). The\ncomplex terms in (b) and (c) are formed with the help of\n\u2018incomplete expressions\u2019 which signify functions, such as\nthe unary squaring function \u2018\\((\\:)^2\\)\u2019 and the binary\naddition function \u2018\\((\\:) + (\\:)\\)\u2019. In these functional\nexpressions, \u2018\\((\\:)\\)\u2019 is used as a placeholder for what\nFrege called the <em>arguments</em> of the function; the placeholder\nreveals that the expressions signifying function are, on Frege\u2019s\nview, incomplete and stand in contrast to complete expressions such as\nthose in (a), (b), and (c). (Though Frege thought it inappropriate to\ncall the incomplete expressions that signify functions\n\u2018names\u2019, we shall sometimes do so in what follows, though\nthe reader should be warned that Frege had reasons for not following\nthis practice.) Thus, a mathematical expression such as\n\u2018\\(2^2\\)\u2019 denotes the result of applying the\nfunction \\((\\:)^2\\) to the number \\(2\\) as argument, namely, the\nnumber \\(4\\). Similarly, the expression \u2018\\(7 + 1\\)\u2019 denotes the\nresult of applying the binary function \\(+((\\:),(\\:))\\) to the\nnumbers \\(7\\) and \\(1\\) as arguments, in that order.</p>", "<p>\n\nEven the sentences of Frege\u2019s mature logical system are\n(complex) denoting terms; they are terms that\ndenote <em>truth-values</em>. Frege distinguished two truth-values,\nThe True and The False, which he took to be objects. The basic\nsentences of Frege\u2019s system are constructed using the expression\n\u2018\\((\\:) = (\\:)\\)\u2019, which signifies a binary function that\nmaps a pair of objects <em>x</em> and\n<em>y</em> to The True if <em>x</em> is identical to <em>y</em> and\nmaps <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> to The False otherwise. A sentence such\nas \u2018\\(2^2 = 4\\)\u2019 therefore denotes the truth-value The\nTrue, while the sentence \u2018\\(2^2 = 6\\)\u2019 denotes The\nFalse.</p>", "<p>\n\nAn important class of these identity statements are statements of the\nform \u2018\\(f(x) = y\\)\u2019, where \\(f(\\:)\\) is any <em>unary</em> function\n(i.e., function of a single variable), \\(x\\) is the argument of the\nfunction, and \\(f(x)\\) is the value of the function for the argument\n\\(x\\). Similarly, \\(f(x,y) = z\\) is an identity statement involving a\n<em>binary</em> function of two variables. And so on, for functions of\nmore than two variables.</p>", "<p>\n\nIf we replace a complete name appearing in a sentence by a\nplaceholder, the result is an incomplete expression that signifies a\nspecial kind of function which Frege called a <em>concept</em>.\n<em>Concepts</em> are functions which map every argument to one of the\ntruth-values. Thus, \u2018\\((\\:) &gt; 2\\)\u2019 denotes the concept\n<em>being greater than</em> \\(2\\), which maps every object greater\nthan \\(2\\) to The True and maps every other object to The\nFalse. Similarly, \u2018\\((\\:)^2 = 4\\)\u2019 denotes the\nconcept <em>that which when squared is identical to</em> \\(4\\). Frege\nwould say that any object that a concept maps to The True <em>falls\nunder</em> the concept. Thus, the number \\(2\\) falls under the\nconcept <em>that which when squared is identical to</em> \\(4\\). In\nwhat follows, we use lower-case expressions like \\(f(\\:)\\) to talk\ngenerally about functions, and upper-case expressions like \\(F(\\:)\\)\nto talk more specifically about those functions which are\nconcepts.</p>", "<p>\n\nFrege supposed that a mathematical claim such as \u2018\\(2\\) is\nprime\u2019 should be formally represented as\n\u2018\\(P(2)\\)\u2019. The verb phrase \u2018is prime\u2019 is\nthereby analyzed as denoting the concept \\(P(\\:)\\) which maps\nprimes to The True and everything else to The False. Thus, a simple\n<em>predication</em> like \u2018\\(2\\) is prime\u2019 becomes\nanalyzed in Frege\u2019s system as a special case of functional\napplication.</p>", "<h4>2.1.2 The Predicate Calculus Within Frege\u2019s Term Logic</h4>", "<p>\n\nThe preceding analysis of simple mathematical predications led Frege\nto extend the applicability of this system to the representation of\nnon-mathematical thoughts and predications. This move formed the basis\nof the modern predicate calculus. Frege analyzed a non-mathematical\npredicate like \u2018is happy\u2019 as signifying a function of one\nvariable which maps its arguments to a truth-value. Thus, \u2018is\nhappy\u2019 denotes a concept which can be represented in the formal\nsystem as \u2018\\(H(\\:)\\)\u2019. \\(H(\\:)\\) maps those arguments\nwhich are happy to The True, and maps everything else to The\nFalse. The sentence \u2018John is happy\u2019, represented as\n\u2018\\(H(j)\\)\u2019, is thereby analyzed as: the object denoted by\n\u2018John\u2019 falls under the concept signified by\n\u2018\\((\\:)\\) is happy\u2019. Thus, a simple predication is\nanalyzed in terms of falling under a concept, which in turn, is\nanalyzed in terms of functions which map their arguments to truth\nvalues. By contrast, in the modern predicate calculus, this last step\nof analyzing predication in terms of functions is not assumed;\npredication is seen as more fundamental than functional application.\nThe sentence \u2018John is happy\u2019 is formally represented as\n\u2018\\(Hj\\)\u2019, where this is a basic form of predication\n(\u2018the object \\(j\\) instantiates or exemplifies the property\n\\(H\\)\u2019). In the modern predicate calculus, functional\napplication is analyzable in terms of predication, as we shall soon\nsee.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn Frege\u2019s analysis, the verb phrase \u2018loves\u2019\nsignifies a binary function of two variables: \\(L((\\:),(\\:))\\). This\nfunction takes a pair of arguments \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) and maps them to\nThe True if \\(x\\) loves \\(y\\) and maps all other pairs of arguments to\nThe False. Although it is a descendent of Frege\u2019s system, the\nmodern predicate calculus analyzes <em>loves</em> as a two-place\nrelation (written: \\(Lxy\\)) rather than a function; some objects stand\nin the relation and others do not. The difference between\nFrege\u2019s understanding of predication and the one manifested by\nthe modern predicate calculus is simply this: in the modern predicate\ncalculus, relations are taken as basic, and functions are defined as a\nspecial case of relation, namely, those relations \\(R\\) such that for\nany objects \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\), if \\(Rxy\\) and \\(Rxz\\), then\n\\(y=z\\). By contrast, Frege took functions to be more basic than\nrelations. His logic is based on functional application rather than\npredication; a binary relation is analyzed as a binary function that\nmaps a pair of arguments to a truth-value.  Thus, a 3-place relation\nlike <em>gives</em> would be analyzed in Frege\u2019s logic as a\nfunction that maps arguments \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\) to an appropriate\ntruth-value depending on whether \\(x\\) gives \\(y\\) to \\(z\\); the\n4-place relation <em>buys</em> would be analyzed as a function that\nmaps the arguments \\(x\\), \\(y\\), \\(z\\), and \\(u\\) to an appropriate\ntruth-value depending on whether \\(x\\) buys \\(y\\) from \\(z\\) for\namount \\(u\\); etc.</p>", "<p>\n So far, we have been discussing Frege\u2019s analysis of\n\u2018atomic\u2019 statements.

In traditional Aristotelian\nlogic, the subject of a sentence and the direct object of a verb are\nnot on a logical par. The rules governing the inferences between\nstatements with different but related subject terms are different from\nthe rules governing the inferences between statements with different\nbut related verb complements. For example, in Aristotelian logic, the\nrule which permits the valid inference from \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019 to \u2018Something loves Mary\u2019 is different from the\nrule which permits the valid inference from \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019 to \u2018John loves something\u2019. The rule governing\nthe first inference is a rule which applies only to subject terms\nwhereas the rule governing the second inference governs reasoning\nwithin the predicate, and thus applies only to the transitive verb\ncomplements (i.e., direct objects). In Aristotelian logic, these\ninferences have nothing in common.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn Frege\u2019s logic, however, a single rule governs both the\ninference from \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 to \u2018Something loves\nMary\u2019 and the inference from \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 to\n\u2018John loves something\u2019. That\u2019s because the subject\nJohn and the direct object Mary are both considered on a logical par,\nas arguments of the function <em>loves</em>. In effect, Frege saw no\nlogical difference between the subject \u2018John\u2019 and the\ndirect object \u2018Mary\u2019. What is logically important is that\n\u2018loves\u2019 denotes a function of two arguments. No matter\nwhether the quantified expression \u2018something\u2019 appears as\nsubject (\u2018Something loves Mary\u2019) or within a predicate\n(\u2018John loves something\u2019), it is to be resolved in the same\nway. In effect, Frege treated these quantified expressions as\nvariable-binding operators. The variable-binding operator \u2018some\n\\(x\\) is such that\u2019 can bind the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 in\nthe open sentence \u2018\\(x\\) loves Mary\u2019 as well as the\nvariable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 in the open sentence \u2018John loves\n\\(x\\)\u2019. Thus, Frege analyzed the above inferences in the\nfollowing general way:</p>", "<ul>\n<li>John loves Mary. Therefore, some \\(x\\) is such that \\(x\\)\nloves Mary.</li>\n\n<li>John loves Mary. Therefore, some \\(x\\) is such that John loves\n\\(x\\).</li>\n\n</ul>", "<p>\n\nBoth inferences are instances of a single valid inference rule. To\nsee this more clearly, here are the formal representations of the above\ninformal arguments:</p>", "<ul>\n<li>\\(Ljm\\) \u2234 \\(\\exists x (Lxm)\\)</li>\n\n<li>\\(Ljm\\) \u2234 \\(\\exists x (Ljx)\\)</li>\n</ul>", "<p>\n\nThe logical axiom which licenses both inferences has the form:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\\(Ra_1 \\ldots a_i \\ldots a_n \\to \\exists x(Ra_1 \\ldots x \\ldots\na_n)\\),</blockquote>", "<p>\n where \\(R\\) is a relation that can take \\(n\\) arguments, \\(a_1,\n\\ldots , a_n\\) are any constants (names), and \\(1 \\leq i \\leq\nn\\). This logical axiom tells us that from a simple predication\ninvolving an \\(n\\)-place relation, one can existentially generalize on\nany argument, and validly derive a existential statement. </p>", "<p>\n\nIndeed, this axiom can be made even more general. If \\(\\phi (a)\\) is\nany statement (formula) in which a constant (name) \\(a\\) appears, and\n\\(\\phi (x)\\) is the result of replacing one or more occurrences of\n\\(a\\) by \\(x\\), then the following is a logical axiom:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\\(\\phi (a) \\to \\exists x \\phi (x)\\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n The inferences which start with the premise \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019, displayed above, both appeal to this axiom for\njustification. This axiom is actually derivable as a theorem from\nFrege\u2019s Basic Law IIa (1893, \u00a747). Basic Law IIa is\nformulated as \\(\\forall x\\phi (x) \\to \\phi (a)\\), where \\(\\phi(a)\\) is\nthe result of substituting \\(a\\) for one or more variables \\(x\\) bound\nby the quantifier (though see below for a more careful discussion of\nthis axiom). So the axiom displayed above for the existential\nquantifier can be derived from IIa using the rules governing\nconditionals, negation, and the definition of \\(\\exists x\\phi\\)\ndiscussed above. </p>", "<p>\n\nThere is one other consequence of Frege\u2019s logic of\nquantification that should be mentioned. Frege took claims of the form\n\\(\\exists x\\phi\\) to be existence claims. He suggested that\n<em>existence</em> is not a concept under which objects fall but\nrather a second-level concept under which first-level concepts fall. A\nconcept \\(F\\) falls under this second-level concept just in case \\(F\\)\nmaps at least one object to The True. So the claim \u2018Martians\ndon\u2019t exist\u2019 is analyzed as an assertion about the\nconcept <em>martian</em>, namely, that nothing falls under it.  Frege\ntherefore took <em>existence</em> to be that second-level concept\nwhich maps a first-level concept \\(F\\) to The True just in case\n\\(\\exists xFx\\). Some philosophers have thought that this analysis\nvalidates Kant\u2019s view that <em>existence</em> is not a (real)\npredicate.</p>", "<h4>2.3.1 Proof</h4>", "<p>\n\nFrege\u2019s system (i.e., his term logic/predicate calculus) consisted\nof a language and an apparatus for proving statements. The latter\nconsisted of a set of logical axioms (statements considered to be\ntruths of logic) and a set of rules of inference that lay out the\nconditions under which certain statements of the language may be\ncorrectly inferred from others. Frege made a point of showing how every\nstep in a proof of a proposition was justified either in terms of one\nof the axioms or in terms of one of the rules of inference or justified\nby a theorem or derived rule that had already been proved.</p>", "<p>\n\nThus, as part of his formal system, Frege developed a strict\nunderstanding of a \u2018proof\u2019. In essence, he defined a proof\nto be any finite sequence of statements such that each statement in the\nsequence either is an axiom or follows from previous members by a valid\nrule of inference. Thus, a proof of a theorem of logic, say \u03c6, is\ntherefore any finite sequence of statements (with \u03c6 the final\nstatement in the sequence) such that each member of the sequence: (a)\nis one of the logical axioms of the formal system, or (b) follows from\nprevious members of the sequence by a rule of inference. These are\nessentially the definitions that logicians still use today.</p>", "<h4>2.3.2 Definition</h4>", "<p>\n\nFrege was extremely careful about the proper description and\ndefinition of logical and mathematical concepts. He developed powerful\nand insightful criticisms of mathematical work which did not meet his\nstandards for clarity. For example, he criticized mathematicians who\ndefined a variable to be a number that varies rather than an expression\nof language which can vary as to which determinate number it may take\nas a value.</p>", "<p>More importantly, however, Frege was the first to claim that a\nproperly formed definition had to have two important metatheoretical\nproperties.  Let us call the new, defined symbol introduced in a\ndefinition the <em>definiendum</em>, and the term that is used to\ndefine the new term the <em>definiens</em>.  Then Frege was the first\nto suggest that proper definitions have to be both <em>eliminable</em>\n(a definendum must always be replaceable by its definiens in any\nformula in which the former occurs) and <em>conservative</em> (a\ndefinition should not make it possible to prove new relationships\namong formulas that were formerly unprovable).  Concerning one of his\ndefinitions in the <em>Begriffsschrift</em> (\u00a724), Frege\nwrites: </p>", "<blockquote>We can do without the notation introduced by this\n  sentence, and hence without the sentence itself as its definition;\n  nothing follows from the sentence that could not also be inferred\n  without it. Our sole purpose in introducing such definitions is to\n  bring about an extrinsic simplificationby stipulating an\n  abbreviation.</blockquote>", "<p>\nFrege later criticized those mathematicians who developed\n\u2018piecemeal\u2019 definitions or \u2018creative\u2019\ndefinitions. In the <em>Grundgesetze der Arithmetik, II</em> (1903,\nSections 56\u201367) Frege criticized the practice of defining a\nconcept on a given range of objects and later redefining the concept\non a wider, more inclusive range of objects. Frequently, this\n\u2018piecemeal\u2019 style of definition led to conflict, since the\nredefined concept did not always reduce to the original concept when\none restricts the range to the original class of objects. In that same\nwork (1903, Sections 139\u2013147), Frege criticized the mathematical\npractice of introducing notation to name (unique) entities without\nfirst proving that there exist (unique) such entities. He pointed out\nthat such \u2018creative definitions\u2019 were simply unjustified.\nCreative definitions fail to be conservative, as this was explained\nabove. </p>", "<h4>2.4.1 Courses-of-Values and Extensions</h4>", "<p>\n\nFrege\u2019s ontology consisted of two fundamentally different types of\nentities, namely, functions and objects (1891, 1892b, 1904). Functions\nare in some sense \u2018unsaturated\u2019; i.e., they are the kind of\nthing which take objects as arguments and map those arguments to a\nvalue. This distinguishes them from objects. As we\u2019ve seen, the domain\nof objects included two special objects, namely, the truth-values The\nTrue and The False.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn his work of 1893/1903, Frege attempted to expand the domain of\nobjects by systematically associating, with each function \\(f\\), an\nobject which he called <em>the course-of-values of</em> \\(f\\). The\ncourse-of-values of a function is a record of the value of the function\nfor each argument. The principle Frege used to systematize\ncourses-of-values is Basic Law V (1893/\u00a720;):</p>", "<blockquote>The course-of-values of the concept \\(f\\) is identical to\nthe course-of-values of the concept \\(g\\) if and only if \\(f\\) and\n\\(g\\) agree on the value of every argument (i.e., if and only if for\nevery object \\(x\\), \\(f(x) = g(x)\\)).</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nFrege used the a Greek epsilon with a smooth breathing mark above it\nas part of the notation for signifying the course-of-values of\nthe function \\(f\\):</p>", "<blockquote>\n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\!f(\\varepsilon)\\) \n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nwhere the first occurrence of the Greek \\(\\varepsilon\\) (with the\nsmooth breathing mark above it) is a \u2018variable-binding\noperator\u2019 which we might read as \u2018the course-of-values\nof\u2019. To avoid the appearance of variable clash, we may also use\na Greek \\(\\alpha\\) (also with a smooth breathing mark above) as a\nvariable-binding operator. Using this notation, Frege formally\nrepresented Basic Law V in his system as:</p>", "<blockquote>\n<strong>Basic Law V</strong> <br> \n\\(\n\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\!f(\\varepsilon) =\n\\, \\stackrel{,}{\\alpha}\\!g(\\alpha) \\equiv \\forall x(f(x) = g(x))\n\\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\n(Actually, Frege used an identity sign instead of the biconditional\nas the main connective of this principle, for reasons described\nabove.)</p>", "<p>\n\nFrege called the course-of-values of a concept \\(F\\) its\n<em>extension</em>. The extension of a concept \\(F\\) records just\nthose objects which \\(F\\) maps to The True. Thus Basic Law V applies\nequally well to the extensions of concepts. Let\n\u2018\\(\\phi(x)\\)\u2019 be an open sentence of any complexity with\nthe free variable \\(x\\) (the variable \\(x\\) may have more than one\noccurrence in \\(\\phi(x)\\), but for simplicity, assume it has only one\noccurrence). Then Frege would use the expression:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\\(\\stackrel{,}{\\varepsilon}\\!\\! \\phi (\\varepsilon)\\),\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nwhere the second epsilon replaces \\(x\\) in \\(\\phi (x)\\), to denote the\nextension of the concept \\(\\phi\\).

For example, the number \\(3\\) is an\nelement of the extension of the concept\n<em>odd number greater than</em> \\(2\\) if and only if this concept\nmaps \\(3\\) to The True.</p>", "<p>\n\nUnfortunately, Basic Law V implies a contradiction, and this was\npointed out to Frege by Bertrand Russell just as the second volume of\nthe <em>Grundgesetze</em> was going to press. Russell recognized that\nsome extensions are elements of themselves and some are not; the\nextension of the concept <em>extension</em> is an element of itself,\nsince that concept would map its own extension to The True. The\nextension of the concept <em>spoon</em> is not an element of itself,\nbecause that concept would map its own extension to The False (since\nextensions aren\u2019t spoons). But now what about the\nconcept <em>extension which is not an element of itself</em>?  Let\n\\(E\\) represent this concept and let \\(e\\) name the extension of\n\\(E\\). Is \\(e\\) an element of itself? Well, \\(e\\) is an element of\nitself if and only if \\(E\\) maps \\(e\\) to The True (by the definition\nof \u2018element of\u2019 given at the end of the previous\nparagraph, where \\(e\\) is the extension of the concept \\(E\\)). But\n\\(E\\) maps \\(e\\) to The True if and only if \\(e\\) is an extension\nwhich is not an element of itself, i.e., if and only if \\(e\\) is not\nan element of itself.

But given that the crucial\ndefinitions of mathematical concepts were stated in terms of\nextensions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V undermined Frege\u2019s attempt\nto establish the thesis of logicism. Few philosophers today believe\nthat mathematics can be reduced to logic in the way Frege had in mind.\nMathematical theories such as set theory seem to require some\nnon-logical concepts (such as set membership) which cannot be defined\nin terms of logical concepts, at least when axiomatized by certain\npowerful non-logical axioms (such as the proper axioms of\nZermelo-Fraenkel set theory).

The leading idea\nis that a statement of number, such as \u2018There are eight\nplanets\u2019 and \u2018There are two authors of <em>Principia\nMathematica</em>\u2019, is really a statement about a concept.

For example, the number of the concept <em>being a square\ncircle</em> is \\(0\\), since nothing falls under it. Similarly, one\ncould define the number \\(1\\) as the extension consisting of all the\nconcepts that satisfy Condition (1) above, and define the number \\(2\\)\nas the extension of all the concepts that satisfy Condition (2) above,\nand so on.  But though this would define a sequence of entities which\nare numbers, this procedure doesn\u2019t actually define the\nconcept <em>natural number</em> (<em>finite number</em>).  Frege,\nhowever, had a deep idea about how to do this.</p>", "<p>\n\nIn order to define the concept of <em>natural number</em>, Frege first\ndefined, for every \\(2\\)-place relation \\(R\\), the general concept\n\u2018\\(x\\) is an ancestor of \\(y\\) in the \\(R\\)-series\u2019. This\nnew relation is called \u2018the ancestral of the relation\n\\(R\\)\u2019. The ancestral of the relation \\(R\\) was first defined in\nFrege\u2019s <em>Begriffsschrift</em> (1879, \u00a726, Proposition\n76; 1884, \u00a779). The intuitive idea is easily grasped if we\nconsider the relation \\(x\\) is the father of \\(y\\). Suppose that \\(a\\)\nis the father of \\(b\\), that \\(b\\) is the father of \\(c\\), and that\n\\(c\\) is the father of \\(d\\). Then Frege\u2019s definition of\n\u2018\\(x\\) is an ancestor of \\(y\\) in the fatherhood-series\u2019\nensures that \\(a\\) is an ancestor of \\(b\\), \\(c\\), and \\(d\\) in this\nseries, that \\(b\\) is an ancestor of \\(c\\) and \\(d\\) in this series,\nand that \\(c\\) is an ancestor of \\(d\\) in this series.</p>", "<p>\n\nMore generally, if given a series of facts of the form \\(aRb\\),\n\\(bRc\\), \\(cRd\\), and so on, Frege showed how to define the relation\n\\(R^*\\), i.e., <em>x is an ancestor of y in the R-series</em>, which\nFrege referred to as: \\(y\\) follows \\(x\\) in the \\(R\\)-series. To\nexploit this definition in the case of natural numbers, Frege had to\ndefine both the relation \\(x\\) <em>precedes</em> \\(y\\) and the\nancestral of this relation, namely, \\(x\\) <em>is an ancestor of</em>\n\\(y\\) <em>in the predecessor-series</em>. He first defined the\nrelational concept \\(x\\) <em>precedes</em> \\(y\\) as follows (1884,\n\u00a776):</p>", "<blockquote>\n\\(x\\) <em>precedes</em> \\(y\\) iff there is a concept \\(F\\) and\nan object \\(z\\) such that: \n\n<ul>\n<li>\\(z\\) falls under \\(F\\),</li>\n\n<li>\\(y\\) is the (cardinal) number of the concept \\(F\\),\nand</li>\n\n<li>\\(x\\) is the (cardinal) number of the concept <em>object falling\nunder</em> \\(F\\) <em>other than</em> \\(z\\)</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIf we again use the notation \\(\\#F\\) to denote the number of \\(F\\)s\nand the \\(\\lambda\\)-notation \\([\\lambda u \\: \\phi]\\) to name the\ncomplex concept <em>being an object</em> \\(u\\) <em>such that</em>\n\\(\\phi\\), Frege\u2019s definition becomes:</p>", "<blockquote>\n \\( \\mathit{Precedes}(x,y) =_\\mathit{df} \n \\exists F \\exists z (Fz \\,\\amp\\, y\\! =\\! \\#F \\,\\amp\\, x\\! =\\!\n \\#[\\lambda u \\: Fu \\amp u\\! \\neq\\! z]) \\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nTo see the intuitive idea behind this definition, consider how the\ndefinition is satisfied in the case of the number 1 preceding the\nnumber \\(2\\): there is a concept \\(F\\) (e.g., let \\(F\\) =\n<em>being an author of Principia Mathematica</em>) and an object \\(z\\)\n(e.g., let \\(z\\) = Alfred North Whitehead) such that:</p>", "<ul>\n<li>Whitehead falls under the concept <em>author of Principia\nMathematica</em>,</li>\n\n<li>\\(2\\) is the (cardinal) number of the concept <em>author of\nPrincipia Mathematica</em>, and</li>\n\n<li>\\(1\\) is the (cardinal) number of the concept <em>author of\nPrincipia Mathematica other than Whitehead</em>.</li>\n</ul>", "<p>\n\nNote that the last conjunct is true because there is exactly 1\nobject (namely, Bertrand Russell) that falls under the concept\n<em>author of Principia Mathematica other than Whitehead</em>.</p>", "<p>\n\nThus, Frege has a definition of <em>precedes</em> which applies to the\nordered pairs \\(\\langle 0,1\\rangle\\), \\(\\langle 1,2\\rangle \\),\n\\(\\langle 2,3\\rangle\\), \u2026\u2009. Frege then defined the\nancestral of this relation, namely, \\(x\\) <em>is an ancestor of</em>\n\\(y\\) <em>in the predecessor-series</em>, or\n\\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*\\). Though the exact definition will not be given\nhere, we note that it has the following consequence: from the facts\nthat \\(10\\) precedes \\(11\\) and \\(11\\) precedes \\(12\\), it follows\nthat \\(10\\) <span class=\"nw\">precedes\\(^*\\)</span> \\(12\\) in the\npredecessor-series. Note, however, that although\n\\(10\\) <span class=\"nw\">precedes\\(^*\\)</span> \\(12\\), \\(10\\) does not\nprecede \\(12\\), for the notion of <em>precedes</em> is that\nof <em>immediately</em> precedes. Note also that by defining the\nancestral of the precedence relation, Frege had in effect defined\n\\(x\\) &lt; \\(y\\) relative to the predecessor-series.</p>", "<p>\n\nRecall that Frege defined the number \\(0\\) as the number of the concept\n<em>being non-self-identical</em>, and that \\(0\\) thereby becomes\nidentified with the extension of all concepts which fail to be\nexemplified. Using this definition, Frege then defined (1884,\n\u00a783) <em>natural number</em> as follows:</p>", "<blockquote>\n   \\(x\\) is a <em>number</em> \u00a0=<sub><em>df</em></sub>\u00a0\n    either \\(x\\! =\\! 0\\) or \\(0\\) is an ancestor of \\(x\\) in the\n    predecessor-series</blockquote>", "<p>which we might represent formally as:</p>", "<blockquote>\n   \\( \\mathit{Number}(x) =_\\mathit{df} x\\! =\\! 0 \u2228\n    \\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,x)\\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIn other words, a natural number is any member of the\npredecessor-series beginning with 0.</p>", "<p>\n\nUsing this definition as a basis, Frege later derived many important\ntheorems of number theory. Philosophers appreciated the importance of\nthis work only relatively recently (C. Parsons 1965, Smiley 1981,\nWright 1983, and Boolos 1987, 1990, 1995). Wright 1983 in particular\nshowed how the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number might be derived from\none of the consistent principles that Frege discussed in 1884, now\nknown as Hume\u2019s Principle (\u201cThe number of \\(F\\)s is equal\nto the number of \\(G\\)s if and only if there is a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between the \\(F\\)s and the \\(G\\)s\u201d). It was\nrecently shown by R. Heck [1993] that, despite the logical\ninconsistency in the system of Frege 1893/1903, Frege himself validly\nderived the Dedekind/Peano axioms from Hume\u2019s\nPrinciple. Although Frege used Basic Law V (which yields an\ninconsistency when added to his second-order logic) to establish\nHume\u2019s Principle, once Hume\u2019s Principle was established,\nthe subsequent derivations of the Dedekind/Peano axioms make no\nfurther essential appeals to Basic Law V.  Following the lead of\nGeorge Boolos, philosophers today call the derivation of the\nDedekind/Peano Axioms from Hume\u2019s Principle \u2018Frege\u2019s\nTheorem\u2019. For a comprehensive introduction to the subtle and\ncomplex logical reasoning involved in this theorem, see the entry\n <a href=\"../frege-theorem/\">Frege\u2019s theorem and foundations for arithmetic</a>.</p>", "<p>\n\nBefore receiving the famous letter from Bertrand Russell informing him\nof the inconsistency in his system, Frege thought that he had shown\nthat arithmetic is reducible to the truths of logic. It is recognized\ntoday, however, that at best Frege showed that arithmetic is reducible\nto second-order logic extended only by Hume\u2019s Principle. Some\nphilosophers think Hume\u2019s Principle is analytically true (i.e., true\nin virtue of the very meanings of its words), while others resist the\nclaim, and there is an interesting debate on this issue in the\nliterature (see, e.g., Boolos 1997, Wright 1999).</p>", "<p>However, for the purposes of this introduction to Frege\u2019s work,\nthere are prior questions on which it is more important to\nfocus. Whereas Frege thought that the truths of arithmetic are\nderivable from analytic truths of logic, Kant thought arithmetic\nprinciples are synthetic, in which case they wouldn\u2019t be derivable\nfrom analytic truths.  Their different conceptions of logic helps to\nexplain why these two philosophers came to such different conclusions.\nIn this section, we therefore turn to the following questions:</p>", "<ol>\n\n<li>How did Frege\u2019s conception of logic differ from Kant\u2019s?\nIn particular:<ul>\n\n <li>What resources (or laws) did Kant and Frege both consider to be\n logical?</li>\n <li>Did Kant and Frege agree about the content and \nsubject matter of logic?</li>\n </ul></li>\n\n<li>How did Frege\u2019s conception of logic differ from that of\nlater logicians?</li>\n\n</ol>", "<p>\nAn answer to the first question sets the stage for answering the\nsecond. </p>", "<h4>2.7.1 How Frege\u2019s Conception of Logic Differed from Kant\u2019s</h4>", "<p>\nOne of the most important differences between Kant and Frege concerns\nthe resources available to logic. Kant\u2019s logic is limited to (a)\nAristotelian term logic with a simple theory of disjunctive and\nhypothetical propositions, and (b) representing inclusion relations\namong concepts (MacFarlane 2002, 26). By contrast, Frege\u2019s logic\nincludes (a) a term-forming operator\n<span class=\"overstrike\"><i>\u03b5</i><span class=\"up\">\u2019</span></span>,\nwhich allows one to form the singular term \n <span class=\"overstrike\"><i>\u03b5</i><span class=\"up\">\u2019</span></span>\u0192(<i>\u03b5</i>)\nfrom the function expression \u0192(<i>\u03be</i>), and (b) a Rule of\nSubstitution, which allows one to substitute complex open formulas for\nfree second-order variables in theorems of logic but also allows one\nto define, and assert the existence of, complex concepts, including\nconcepts defined in terms of quantifiers over concepts.  We\u2019ll\ndiscuss both of these resources below, but first, the discussion needs\nsome context.</p>", "<p>\nThe differences concerning the resources available to logic revolve\naround a key issue, namely, whether the additional resources Frege\nassigns to logic require an appeal to non-logical constructions,\nspecifically to a faculty of \u2018intuition\u2019, that is, an\nextralogical source which presents our minds with phenomena about\nwhich judgments can be formed.  (Recall the discussion above about\nFrege\u2019s early interest in appeals to intuition.)  The debate\nover which resources do and do not require an appeal to intuition is\nan important one. Frege continued a trend started by Bolzano (1817),\nwho eliminated the appeal to intuition in the proof of the\nIntermediate Value Theorem in the calculus (which in its simplest form\nasserts that a continuous function having both positive and negative\nvalues must cross the origin). Bolzano proved this theorem from the\ndefinition of continuity, which had recently been given in terms\nsimilar to the definition of a limit (see Coffa 1991, 27). A Kantian\nmight simply draw a graph of a continuous function which takes values\nabove and below the origin, and thereby \u2018demonstrate\u2019 that\nsuch a function must cross the origin.  But appeal to a graph involves\nan appeal to intuition, and both Bolzano and Frege saw such appeals to\nintuition as potentially introducing logical gaps into a proof. There\nare reasons to be suspicious about such appeals: (1) there are\nfunctions which we can\u2019t graph or otherwise construct for\npresentation to our intuitive faculty, e.g., the function \\(f\\) which\nmaps rational numbers to \\(0\\) and irrational numbers to \\(1\\), or the\nfunctions noted by Weierstrass, which are everywhere continuous but\nnowhere differentiable; (2) once we take certain intuitive notions and\nformalize them in terms of explicit definitions, the formal definition\nmight imply counterintuitive results; and (3) the rules of inference\nfrom statements to constructions and back are not always clear.</p>", "<p>\nFrege dedicated himself to the idea of eliminating appeals to\nintuition in the proofs of the basic propositions of arithmetic.  He\nexplicitly remarked upon this fact in a number of works throughout his\ncareer (1879, Preface/5, Part III/\u00a723; 1884, \u00a7\u00a762, 87;\n1893, \u00a70; and 1903, Appendix). Thus, he would deny Kant\u2019s\ndictum (A51 [B75]), \u2018Without sensibility, no object would be\ngiven to us\u2019, and claim instead that \\(0\\) and \\(1\\) are objects\nbut that they \u2018can\u2019t be given to us in sensation\u2019\n(1884, 101). Frege\u2019s view is that we can understand or grasp\nthem as objects if we (a) define them as extensions of concepts, and\n(b) show that singular terms of the form\n <span class=\"overstrike\"><i>\u03b5</i><span class=\"up\">\u2019</span></span>\u0192(<i>\u03b5</i>))\ncan be axiomatized by an analytic proposition. (The latter was to be\naccomplished by Basic Law V, and so the collapse of this law in light\nof Russell\u2019s paradox undermined this part of his plan for\navoiding appeals to intuition.)</p>", "<p>\nMoreover, philosophers have questioned whether Frege\u2019s Rule of\nSubstitution (<em>Grundgesetze I</em>, 1893, \u00a748, item 9) also\nrequired an appeal to intuition. The Rule of Substitution allows one\nto substitute complex formulas for free second-order variables in\nlogical theorems to produce new logical theorems. Boolos argued (1985,\n336\u2013338) that since Frege\u2019s Rule of Substitution is\nequivalent to a Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it is\nextralogical in character. The Comprehension Principle for Concepts\nasserts \\(\\exists F \\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\phi)\\), provided \\(\\phi\\)\ndoesn\u2019t have a free variable \\(F\\); the proviso blocks the\ninstance \\(\\exists F\\forall x(Fx \\equiv \\neg Fx)\\), from which one can\nquickly derive a contradiction. Thus, the Comprehension Principle for\nConcepts asserts the existence of a concept corresponding to every\nexpressible condition on objects. From Kant\u2019s point of view,\nsuch existence claims were thought to be synthetic and in need of\njustification by the faculty of intuition. So, although it was one of\nFrege\u2019s goals to avoid appeals to the faculty of intuition,\nthere is a question as to whether his system of second-order logic\n(minus Basic Law V), which implies a principle asserting the existence\nof a wide range of concepts, really is limited in its scope to purely\nlogical laws of an analytic nature.</p>", "<p>\nIf we now put aside their differences about logic\u2019s resources\nand the appeal to intuition, there are other ways in which the Kantian\nand Fregean conceptions of logic differ.  Both MacFarlane (2002) and\nLinnebo (2003) point out that one of Kant\u2019s central views about\nlogic is that its axioms and theorems are purely formal in nature\n(i.e., abstracted from all semantic content and concerned only with\nthe <em>forms</em> of judgments) and are applicable across all the\nphysical and mathematical sciences (1781 [1787], A55 [B79], A56 [B80],\nA70 [B95]; and 1800, 15).  And Kant takes the laws of logic to be\nnormative and prescriptive (something one can get wrong), and not just\ndescriptive (1800, 16); they provide <em>constitutive norms</em> of\nthought (MacFarlane 2002, 35; Tolley 2008).  Indeed, Linnebo takes two\ntheses, that logic is formal and provides laws that are constitutive\nnorms of thought, to be distinctive of Kant\u2019s conception\n(Linnebo 2003, 240).</p>", "<p>\nBy contrast, Frege rejects the idea that logic is a purely formal\nenterprise (MacFarlane 2002, 29; Linnebo 2003, 243). He took logic to\nhave its own unique subject matter, which included not only facts\nabout concepts (concerning negation, subsumption, etc.) and identity,\nbut also facts about relations (e.g., their properties and\nancestrals). Frege (1906, 428 [1984, 338]) says:</p>", "<blockquote>\nJust as the concept point belongs to geometry, so logic, too, has its\nown concepts and relations; and it is only in virtue of this that it\ncan have a content. Toward what is thus proper to it, its relation is\nnot at all formal. No science is completely formal; but even\ngravitational mechanics is formal to a certain degree, in so far as\noptical and chemical properties are all the same to it. \u2026 To\nlogic, for example, there belong the following: negation, identity,\nsubsumption, subordination of concepts.</blockquote>", "<p>\nAnd, of course, as we\u2019ve seen, Frege supposed that there is a domain\nof special logical objects (<em>courses of values</em>), among which\nhe defined, and \u2013 until confronted by Russell\u2019s paradox \u2013\ntook himself to have proved facts about, <em>extensions</em>\nand <em>natural numbers</em> (1884, 1893/1903).  Logic, then, is not\npurely formal, from Frege\u2019s point of view, but rather can provide\nsubstantive knowledge of concepts and objects.</p>", "<p>\nThere is some question, however, as to the extent to which Frege took\nlogic to provide constitutive norms of thought.  Linnebo suggests that\nFrege eventually rejected this idea. Though he offers various\narguments for thinking that Frege moved away from the constitutivity\nthesis, his [Linnebo\u2019s] main argument concerns the fact that Frege\nwanted to position Basic Law V as a logical claim, but that Basic Law\nV doesn\u2019t seem to be a constitutive norm of thought (Linnebo 2003,\n247).  This is a persuasive reason, though it does make one wonder\nwhat Frege could have meant, in the second volume\nof <em>Grundgesetze</em> (\u00a7147), when he said, concerning Basic\nLaw V:</p>", "<blockquote>\nIf there are logical objects at all \u2026 then there must also be a\nmeans of apprehending, or recognizing them. This \u2026 is performed\n\u2026 by the fundamental law of logic that permits the\ntransformation of an equality holding generally\n[\\(\\forall x(f(x)\\! =\\! g(x))\\)] into an\nequation\n[<span class=\"overstrike\"><i>\u03b5</i><span class=\"up\">\u2019</span></span>\u0192(<i>\u03b5</i>)\n=\n<span class=\"overstrike\"><i>\u03b1</i><span class=\"up\">\u2019</span></span><em>g</em>(<i>\u03b1</i>)].\n[Authors note: the equations in brackets were added for the sake of\nclarity.] </blockquote>", "<p>\nGiven Frege\u2019s commitment to logical objects as part of the\ncontent of logic, the above passage suggests that he might have\nregarded the law which transformed an equality holding generally into\nan equation as a constitutive norm of thought.</p>", "<p>\nBut many Frege scholars are convinced that Frege took the laws of\nlogic to provide constitutive norms of thought (MacFarlane 2002,\nTaschek 2008, Steinberger 2017).  MacFarlane, in particular, argues\nthat Kant and Frege may have agreed that one of the most important\ncharacteristics of logic is its generality, and that this generality\nconsists in the fact that it provides normative rules and\nprescriptions. He notes that \u201c[t]he generality of logic, for\nFrege as for Kant, is a <em>normative</em> generality: logic is\ngeneral in the sense that it provides constitutive norms for\nthought <em>as such</em>, regardless of its subject matter\u201d\n(2002, 35). So, though they may differ as to which principles are\nlogical, there may be at least one point of reconciliation concerning\nhow Kant and Frege conceived of logic. </p>", "<h4>2.7.2 How Frege\u2019s Conception Differed from Later Logicians</h4>", "<p>\nGiven the constraints of the present entry, we shall not attempt to\ndiscuss this question in any detail; instead, we present only the\nbarest of outlines. After all, modern logicians and philosophers of\nlogic have not yet come to agreement about the proper conception of\nlogic.  Many have a conception of logic that is yet different from\nboth Kant\u2019s and Frege\u2019s, one that was, to some extent,\nanticipated by Bolzano, namely, that logical concepts and laws remain\ninvariant under reinterpretation of the non-logical constants or under\npermutations of the domain of quantification. But since this modern\nconception is still a matter of debate, it may be that elements of\nFrege\u2019s conception will yet play a role in our understanding of\nwhat logic is.</p>", "<p>It is important to recognize just how much Frege took himself to be\nfocusing on the <em>content</em>, as opposed to the <em>form</em>, of\nthoughts. His concern to more precisely represent the content of\nthoughts is stated explicitly in an 1882 lecture before Jena\u2019s\nSociety for Medicine and Natural Science, where he distinguished his\n1879 system from Boole\u2019s logic by saying:</p>", "<blockquote>I was not trying to present an abstract logic in formulas;\nI was trying to express contents in an exacter and more perspicuous\nmanner than is possible in words, by using written symbols. I was\ntrying, in fact, to create a \u201c<em>lingua\ncharacteristica</em>\u201d in the Leibnizian sense, not a mere\n\u201c<em>calculus ratiocinator</em>\u201d\u2014not that I do not\nrecognize such a deductive calculus as a necessary constituent of a\n<em>Begriffsschrift</em>.  [Frege 1882, V.H. Dudman (trans.)\n1968] </blockquote>", "<p>\nSo Frege was not just trying to develop an abstract reasoning system\nfor the precise derivations of theorems from axioms (see van\nHeijenoort 1967 for discussion).  Frege was at least as interested in\nformalizing the <em>content</em> of reasoning as he was in formulating\nthe rules for deriving a given thought from some group of\nthoughts. Frege would <em>not</em> have regarded the logical axioms of\nhis formal systems as axiom <em>schemata</em>, i.e., as a\nmetalinguistic sentence patterns whose instances (i.e., the sentences\nof the object language that match the pattern) are axioms (see\nGoldfarb 2001 for discussion). Nor would he have agreed that the\nlogical axioms of his system were uninterpreted sentences. His unease\nwith the modern conception of an uninterpreted formal system was\nexpressed in his reaction to Hilbert\u2019s <em>Foundations of\nGeometry</em> (Frege 1906, 384 [1984, 315]):</p>", "<blockquote>\nThe word \u2018interpretation\u2019 is objectionable, for when\nproperly expressed, a thought leaves no room for different\ninterpretations. We have seen that ambiguity simply has to be rejected\n\u2026</blockquote>", "<p>\nInstead, Frege thought that his logical axioms are (a) fundamental\ntruths governing negation, conditionalization, quantification,\nidentity, and description, and (b) principles from which other such\nfundamental truths could be derived. Indeed, even though Frege\nsometimes introduces methods for abbreviating these truths, he takes\ngreat pains to insist that these abbreviations are to be understood in\nterms of the full content being expressed.  For example, he summarizes\nthe law of universal instantiation (Basic Law IIa) in 1893/\u00a747\nusing a formula that we would write nowadays as:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\\(\\forall xFx \\to Fy\\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nBut closer inspection of \u00a720, where this principle is first\ndiscussed, and of \u00a717, where he introduces some notational\nconventions used in \u00a720, makes it clear that the above is\nshorthand for:</p>", "<blockquote>\n\\(\\forall F \\forall y(\\forall xFx \\to Fy)\\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThis latter is a sentence; it is not a schema, nor an open formula\nwith a free variable, nor an uninterpreted sentence.  Rather it\nasserts something that Frege takes to be fundamental law, namely: for\nany property \\(F\\) and for any object \\(y\\), if everything\nfalls under \\(F\\), then \\(y\\) falls under \\(F\\).</p>", "<p>\nFrege\u2019s understanding of, and attitude towards, the formulas of\nhis formal language goes a long way towards explaining why his\nposition, in the now famous debate with Hilbert about the status of\nthe axioms in a formal system, is not an unreasonable one. At first\nglance, it looks as if Frege has mistakenly challenged Hilbert\u2019s\nmethod of relative interpretability, whereby one can prove the\nconsistency and independence of axiom systems by re-intepreting, and\nthereby reducing, them to systems assumed to be\nconsistent. Frege\u2019s objections about what exactly has been\nestablished by these relative consistency proofs may seem misguided to\na modern ear.  But since Frege and Hilbert understood the notions\nof <em>consistency</em> and <em>independence</em> differently, they\ndidn\u2019t always directly engage with the other\u2019s ideas.\nBlanchette nicely shows, both in the entry on the\n  <a href=\"../frege-hilbert/\">Frege-Hilbert controversy</a> and in her\nbook (2012, Ch. 5), that if the notions of consistency and\nindependence are understood Hilbert\u2019s way, then Hilbert\u2019s\nmethods do establish what he says they do, but that if these notions\nare understood Frege\u2019s way, they don\u2019t.

He wouldn\u2019t answer the\nquestion, of whether one thought is a logical consequence of another,\nsolely by looking at the form of the sentences that express them, but\nrather by looking at the content of those sentences. Given the meaning\n(content) that \u2018nightmare\u2019 and \u2018dream\u2019 in fact\nhave, \u201c\\(x\\) had a dream\u201d is a logical consequence of\n\u201c\\(x\\) had a nightmare\u201d, for <em>having a nightmare</em>,\ni.e., <em>having a bad dream</em>, logically implies <em>having a\ndream</em>. So, for Frege, this would clearly be a case of logical\nconsequence.</p>", "<p>\nThis analogy might help one to see how Frege and Hilbert might differ\nin their approach to questions of consistency and interpretation.  On\nFrege\u2019s view, the consistency of a group of axioms depends on\ncontent, and if the form of these axioms, under logical analysis,\nsufficiently captures their content, this consistency will be\ninherited by their formal representations as well.  Of course, in\nproving consistency, Hilbert was concerned primarily to determine\nwhether an axiom system entailed a contradiction having the form\n\\(\\phi \\amp \\neg \\phi\\).  So, given this <em>formal</em> goal,\nHilbert\u2019s methods are useful and immune to criticism.</p>", "<p>\nBut this brings us to one final issue that is crucial to Frege\u2019s\nconception of logic, namely, the extent to which his formal\nrepresentations capture the content of the claims being\nanalyzed. This issue is relevant because Frege\u2019s primary tool for\nanalyzing the content of a mathematical or philosophical claim is by\nway of representing the content in a system that <em>axiomatizes</em>\nthe fundamental concepts that are needed for the analysis.  This issue\nis the subject of the first half of Blanchette 2012. To see what is at\nstake, we vary the example from the one used in Blanchette 2012\n(24). Frege would represent the arithmetical law:</p>", "<blockquote>\nNo (natural) number precedes zero\n</blockquote>", "<p>in the first instance, as:</p>", "<blockquote>\n \\( \\neg \\exists x(\\mathit{Number}(x) \\amp \\mathit{Precedes}(x,0)) \\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>Then if we substitute Frege\u2019s definitions of\n\\(\\mathit{Number}(x)\\), \\(\\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)\\), and \\(0\\), as\ndescribed in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 above, his representation of the\narithmetical law becomes:</p>", "<blockquote>\n \\(\\neg \\exists x((x\\! =\\! 0 \\lor \\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,x)) \\amp \\\\ \\\n    \\ \\ \\exists F \\exists z(Fz \\amp 0\\! =\\! \\#F \\amp x\\! =\\!\n    \\#[\\lambda u \\: Fu \\amp u \\! \\neq\\! z])) \\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThough the formal representation could be taken further, if we expand\nthe definitions of \\(\\mathit{Precedes}^*\\), \\(\\#F\\), and \\(\\#[\\lambda\nu \\: Fu \\amp u \\!\\neq\\! z]\\), enough has been said to pose the\nquestion: why think that by deriving the formal representation from\nmore fundamental principles, Frege has derived the arithmetic law that\nno natural number precedes Zero?  This question is tackled in some\ndetail in in the early part of Blanchette 2012, which investigates\nFrege\u2019s understanding of conceptual analysis. Her answer\n(Chapter 4) is that the formal representation of the arithmetic law\nhas to be (self-evidently) logically equivalent to a good analysis of\nthe original. If it is, then notwithstanding Frege\u2019s failed\nreduction of numbers to extensions, a derivation of the formal\nrepresentation from more general logical laws of the kind represented\nin his system would have in fact achieved the goal of reducing\narithmetic to logic. The reader is directed to her work for discussion\nof this important point.</p>", "<p>\n\nWhile pursuing his investigations into mathematics and logic (and\nquite possibly, in order to ground those investigations), Frege was\nled to develop a philosophy of language. His philosophy of language\nhas had just as much, if not more, impact than his contributions to\nlogic and mathematics. Frege\u2019s seminal paper in this field\n\u2018\u00dcber Sinn und Bedeutung\u2019 (\u2018On Sense and\nReference\u2019, 1892a) is now a classic. In this paper, Frege\nconsidered two puzzles about language and noticed, in each case, that\none cannot account for the meaningfulness or logical behavior of\ncertain sentences simply on the basis of the denotations of the terms\n(names and descriptions) in the sentence. One puzzle concerned\nidentity statements and the other concerned sentences with subordinate\nclauses such as propositional attitude reports. To solve these\npuzzles, Frege suggested that the terms of a language have both a\nsense and a denotation, i.e., that at least two semantic relations are\nrequired to explain the significance or meaning of the terms of a\nlanguage. This idea has inspired research in the field for over a\ncentury and we discuss it in what follows.  (See Heck and May 2006 for\nfurther discussion of Frege\u2019s contribution to the philosophy of\nlanguage.)</p>", "<h4>3.1.1 Frege\u2019s Puzzle About Identity Statements</h4>", "<p>\n\nHere are some examples of identity statements:</p>", "<blockquote>\\(117+136 = 253\\).\n<br>\n The morning star is identical to the evening star.\n<br>\n Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens.\n<br>\n Bill is Debbie\u2019s father.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nFrege believed that these statements all have the form\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, where \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(b\\)\u2019 are either names or descriptions that\n<em>denote</em> individuals. He naturally assumed that a sentence of\nthe form \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 is true if and only if the object \\(a\\)\njust is (identical to) the object \\(b\\). For example, the sentence\n\u2018\\(117+136 = 253\\)\u2019 is true if and only if the number \\(117+136\\)\njust is the number \\(253\\). And the statement \u2018Mark Twain is Samuel\nClemens\u2019 is true if and only if the person Mark Twain just is\nthe person Samuel Clemens.</p>", "<p>\n\nBut Frege noticed (1892a) that this account of truth can\u2019t be\nall there is to the meaning of identity statements. The statement\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 has a cognitive significance (or meaning) that\nmust be different from the cognitive significance of\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. We can learn that \u2018Mark Twain = Mark\nTwain\u2019 is true simply by inspecting it; but we can\u2019t learn\nthe truth of \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 simply by\ninspecting it \u2014 you have to examine the world to see whether the\ntwo persons are the same. Similarly, whereas you can learn that\n\u2018\\(117+136 = 117+136\\)\u2019 and \u2018the morning star is\nidentical to the morning star\u2019 are true simply by inspection,\nyou can\u2019t learn the truth of \u2018\\(117+136 = 253\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018the morning star is identical to the evening star\u2019 simply\nby inspection. In the latter cases, you have to do some arithmetical\nwork or astronomical investigation to learn the truth of these\nidentity claims. Now the problem becomes clear: the meaning of\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 clearly differs from the meaning of\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, but given the account of the truth described in\nthe previous paragraph, these two identity statements appear to have\nthe same meaning whenever they are true! For example, \u2018Mark\nTwain = Mark Twain\u2019 is true just in case: the person Mark Twain is\nidentical with the person Mark Twain. And \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel\nClemens\u2019 is true just in case: the person Mark Twain is\nidentical with the person Samuel Clemens. But given that Mark Twain\njust is Samuel Clemens, these two cases are the same case, and that\ndoesn\u2019t explain the difference in meaning between the two\nidentity sentences. And something similar applies to all the other\nexamples of identity statements having the forms\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019.</p>", "<p>\n\nSo the puzzle Frege discovered is: how do we account for the\ndifference in cognitive significance between \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 when they are true?</p>", "<h4>3.1.2 Frege\u2019s Puzzle About Propositional Attitude Reports</h4>", "<p>\n\nFrege is generally credited with identifying the following puzzle\nabout propositional attitude reports, even though he didn\u2019t quite\ndescribe the puzzle in the terms used below. A propositional attitude\nis a psychological relation between a person and a proposition. Belief,\ndesire, intention, discovery, knowledge, etc., are all psychological\nrelationships between persons, on the one hand, and propositions, on\nthe other. When we report the propositional attitudes of others, these\nreports all have a similar logical form:</p>", "<blockquote>\n \\(x\\) believes that \\(p\\)\n<br>\n \\(x\\) desires that \\(p\\)\n<br>\n \\(x\\) intends that \\(p\\)\n<br>\n \\(x\\) discovered that \\(p\\)\n<br>\n \\(x\\) knows that \\(p\\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIf we replace the variable \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 by the name of a person\nand replace the variable \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 with a sentence that\ndescribes the propositional object of their attitude, we get specific\nattitude reports. So by replacing \u2018\\(x\\)\u2019 by\n\u2018John\u2019 and \u2018\\(p\\)\u2019 by \u2018Mark Twain\nwrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>\u2019 in the first example, the\nresult would be the following specific belief report:</p>", "<blockquote>\n John believes that Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>.\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nTo see the problem posed by the analysis of propositional attitude\nreports, consider what appears to be a simple principle of reasoning,\nnamely, the Principle of Identity Substitution (this is not to be\nconfused with the Rule of Substitution discussed earlier). If a name,\nsay \\(n\\), appears in a true sentence \\(S\\), and the identity sentence\n\\(n=m\\) is true, then the Principle of Identity Substitution tells us\nthat the substitution of the name \\(m\\) for the name \\(n\\) in \\(S\\)\ndoes not affect the truth of \\(S\\). For example, let \\(S\\) be the true\nsentence \u2018Mark Twain was an author\u2019, let\n\\(n\\) be the name \u2018Mark Twain\u2019, and let \\(m\\) be\nthe name \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019. Then since the identity\nsentence \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 is true, we can\nsubstitute \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 for \u2018Mark Twain\u2019\nwithout affecting the truth of the sentence. And indeed, the resulting\nsentence \u2018Samuel Clemens was an author\u2019 is true. In other\nwords, the following argument is valid:</p>", "<blockquote>\n Mark Twain was an author.\n<br>\n Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens.\n<br>\n Therefore, Samuel Clemens was an author.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nSimilarly, the following argument is valid.</p>", "<blockquote>\n \\(4 &gt; 3\\)\n<br>\n \\(4 = 8/2\\)\n<br>\nTherefore, \\(8/2 &gt; 3\\)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIn general, then, the Principle of Identity Substitution seems to take\nthe following form, where \\(S\\) is a sentence, \\(n\\) and \\(m\\) are\nnames, and \\(S(n)\\) differs from \\(S(m)\\) only by the fact\nthat at least one occurrence of \\(m\\) replaces \\(n\\):</p>", "<blockquote>\nFrom \\(S(n)\\) and \\(n=m\\), infer \\(S(m)\\).\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThis principle seems to capture the idea that if we say something\ntrue about an object, then even if we change the name by which we refer\nto that object, we should still be saying something true about that\nobject.</p>", "<p>\n\nBut Frege, in effect, noticed the following counterexample to the\nPrinciple of Identity Substitution. Consider the following\nargument:</p>", "<blockquote>\n John believes that Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>.\n<br>\n Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens.\n<br>\n Therefore, John believes that Samuel Clemens wrote <em>Huckleberry\nFinn</em>.\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nThis argument is not valid. There are circumstances in which the\npremises are true and the conclusion false. We have already described\nsuch circumstances, namely, one in which John learns the name\n\u2018Mark Twain\u2019 by reading <em>Huckleberry Finn</em> but\nlearns the name \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 in the context of learning\nabout 19th century American authors (without learning that the name\n\u2018Mark Twain\u2019 was a pseudonym for Samuel Clemens). John may\n<em>not</em> believe that Samuel Clemens wrote <em>Huckleberry\nFinn</em>. The premises of the above argument, therefore, do not\nlogically entail the conclusion. So the Principle of Identity\nSubstitution appears to break down in the context of propositional\nattitude reports.  The puzzle, then, is to say what causes the\nprinciple to fail in these contexts. Why aren\u2019t we still saying\nsomething true about the man in question if all we have done is\nchanged the name by which we refer to him?</p>", "<p>\n\nTo explain these puzzles, Frege suggested (1892a) that in addition to\nhaving a denotation, names and descriptions also express a\n <em>sense</em>.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-5\" id=\"ref-5\">5</a>]</sup> \n The sense of an expression accounts for its\ncognitive significance\u2014it is the way by which one conceives of\nthe denotation of the term. The expressions \u2018\\(4\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(8/2\\)\u2019 have the same denotation but express\ndifferent senses, different ways of conceiving the same number. The\ndescriptions \u2018the morning star\u2019 and \u2018the evening\nstar\u2019 denote the same planet, namely Venus, but express\ndifferent ways of conceiving of Venus and so have different\nsenses. The name \u2018Pegasus\u2019 and the description \u2018the\nmost powerful Greek god\u2019 both have a sense (and their senses are\ndistinct), but neither has a denotation. However, even though the\nnames \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 and \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 denote\nthe same individual, they express different senses. (See May 2006b for\na nice discussion of the question of whether Frege believed that the\nsense of a name varies from person to person.) Using the distinction\nbetween sense and denotation, Frege can account for the difference in\ncognitive significance between identity statements of the form\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and those of the form\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. Since the sense of \u2018\\(a\\)\u2019 differs\nfrom the sense of \u2018\\(b\\)\u2019, the components of the sense of\n\u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and the sense of \u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019 are\ndifferent.  Frege can claim that the sense of the whole expression is\ndifferent in the two cases. Since the sense of an expression accounts\nfor its cognitive significance, Frege has an explanation of the\ndifference in cognitive significance between \u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019, and thus a solution to the first puzzle.</p>", "<p>\n\nMoreover, Frege proposed that when a term (name or description)\nfollows a propositional attitude verb, it no longer denotes what it\nordinarily denotes. Instead, Frege claims that in such contexts, a\nterm denotes its ordinary sense. This explains why the Principle of\nIdentity Substitution fails for terms following the propositional\nattitude verbs in propositional attitude reports. The Principle\nasserts that truth is preserved when we substitute one name for\nanother having the same denotation. But, according to Frege\u2019s\ntheory, the names \u2018Mark Twain\u2019 and \u2018Samuel\nClemens\u2019 denote different senses when they occur in the\nfollowing sentences:</p>", "<blockquote>\nJohn believes that Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>.\n<br>\n John believes that Samuel Clemens wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>.\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nIf they don\u2019t denote the same object, then there is no reason to\nthink that substitution of one name for another would preserve\ntruth.</p>", "<p>\n\nFrege developed the theory of sense and denotation into a\nthoroughgoing philosophy of language. This philosophy can be\nexplained, at least in outline, by considering a simple sentence such\nas \u2018John loves Mary\u2019. In Frege\u2019s view, the words\n\u2018John\u2019 and \u2018Mary\u2019 in this sentence are names,\nthe expression \u2018loves\u2019 signifies a function, and,\nmoreover, the sentence as a whole is a complex name. Each of these\nexpressions has both a sense and a denotation. The sense and\ndenotation of the names are basic; but sense and denotation of the\nsentence as a whole can be described in terms of the sense and\ndenotation of the names and the way in which those words are arranged\nin the sentence alongside the expression \u2018loves\u2019. Let us\nrefer to the denotation and sense of the words as follows:</p>", "<blockquote>\n \\(d[j]\\) refers to the denotation of the name \u2018John\u2019.\n<br>\n \\(d[m]\\) refers to the denotation of the name\n\u2018Mary\u2019.\n<br>\n \\(d[L]\\) refers to the denotation of the expression\n\u2018loves\u2019.\n<br>\n \\(s[j]\\) refers to the sense of the name\n\u2018John\u2019.\n<br>\n \\(s[m]\\) refers to the sense of the name\n\u2018Mary\u2019.\n<br>\n \\(s[L]\\) refers to the sense of the expression\n\u2018loves\u2019.</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nWe now work toward a theoretical description of the denotation of the\nsentence as a whole. On Frege\u2019s view, \\(d[j]\\) and\n\\(d[m]\\) are the real individuals John and Mary,\nrespectively. \\(d[L]\\) is a function that maps\n\\(d[m]\\) (i.e., Mary) to the function (\u00a0)\n<em>loves Mary</em>. This latter function serves as the denotation of\nthe predicate \u2018loves Mary\u2019 and we can use the notation\n\\(d[Lm]\\) to refer to it semantically. Now the function \\(d[Lm]\\) maps\n\\(d[j]\\) (i.e., John) to the denotation of the sentence \u2018John\nloves Mary\u2019.  Let us refer to the denotation of the sentence as\n\\(d[jLm]\\). Frege identifies the denotation of a sentence as one of\nthe two truth values.  Because \\(d[Lm]\\) maps objects to truth values,\nit is a concept. Thus, \\(d[jLm]\\) is the truth value The True if John\nfalls under the concept \\(d[Lm]\\); otherwise it is the truth value The\nFalse. So, on Frege\u2019s view, the sentence \u2018John loves\nMary\u2019 names a truth \nvalue.<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-6\" id=\"ref-6\">6</a>]</sup></p>", "<p>\n\nThe sentence \u2018John loves Mary\u2019 also expresses a sense.\nIts sense may be described as follows. Although Frege doesn\u2019t\nappear to have explicitly said so, his work suggests that \\(s[L]\\)\n(the sense of the expression \u2018loves\u2019) is a function. This\nfunction would map \\(s[m]\\) (the sense of the name \u2018Mary\u2019)\nto the sense of the predicate \u2018loves Mary\u2019. Let us refer\nto the sense of \u2018loves Mary\u2019 as \\(s[Lm]\\). Now again,\nFrege\u2019s work seems to imply that we should regard \\(s[Lm]\\) as a\nfunction which maps \\(s[j]\\) (the sense of the name\n\u2018John\u2019) to the sense of the whole sentence. Let us call\nthe sense of the entire sentence\n \\(s[jLm]\\).<sup>[<a href=\"notes.html#note-7\" id=\"ref-7\">7</a>]</sup>\n Frege calls the sense of a sentence a\n<em>thought</em>, and whereas there are only two truth values, he\nsupposes that there are an infinite number of thoughts.</p>", "<p>\n\nWith this description of language, Frege can give a general account of\nthe difference in the cognitive significance between identity\nstatements of the form \u2018\\(a=a\\)\u2019 and\n\u2018\\(a=b\\)\u2019. The cognitive significance is not accounted for\nat the level of denotation. On Frege\u2019s view, the sentences\n\u2018\\(4=8/2\\)\u2019 and \u2018\\(4=4\\)\u2019 both denote\nthe same truth value. The function \\((\\:)=(\\:)\\) maps \\(4\\) and\n\\(8/2\\) to The True, i.e., maps \\(4\\) and \\(4\\) to The\nTrue. So \\(d[4=8/2]\\) is identical to \\(d[4=4]\\); they are\nboth The True. However, the two sentences in question express\ndifferent thoughts. That is because \\(s[4]\\) is different from\n\\(s[8/2]\\). So the thought \\(s[4=8/2]\\) is distinct\nfrom the thought \\(s[4=4]\\). Similarly, \u2018Mark Twain = Mark\nTwain\u2019 and \u2018Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens\u2019 denote the\nsame truth value. However, given that \\(s\\)[Mark Twain] is distinct\nfrom \\(s\\)[Samuel Clemens], Frege would claim that the thought\n\\(s\\)[Mark Twain = Mark Twain] is distinct from the thought\n\\(s\\)[Mark Twain = Samuel Clemens].</p>", "<p>\n\nFurthermore, recall that Frege proposed that terms following\npropositional attitude verbs denote not their ordinary denotations but\nrather the senses they ordinarily express. In fact, in the following\npropositional attitude report, not only do the words \u2018Mark\nTwain\u2019, \u2018wrote\u2019 and \u2018<em>Huckleberry Finn</em>\n\u2019 denote their ordinary senses, but the entire sentence\n\u2018Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>\u2019 also denotes\nits ordinary sense (namely, a thought):</p>", "<blockquote>\nJohn believes that Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>.\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nFrege, therefore, would analyze this attitude report as follows:\n\u2018believes that\u2019 denotes a function that maps the denotation\nof the sentence \u2018Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry\nFinn</em>\u2019 to a concept. In this case, however, the denotation of\nthe sentence \u2018Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>\u2019\nis not a truth value but rather a thought. The thought it denotes is\ndifferent from the thought denoted by \u2018Samuel Clemens wrote\n<em>Huckleberry Finn</em>\u2019 in the following propositional\nattitude report:</p>", "<blockquote>\nJohn believes that Samuel Clemens wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>.\n</blockquote>", "<p>\n\nSince the thought denoted by \u2018Samuel Clemens wrote\n<em>Huckleberry Finn</em>\u2019 in this context differs from the\nthought denoted by \u2018Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry\nFinn</em>\u2019 in the same context, the concept denoted by\n\u2018believes that Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>\u2019\nis a different concept from the one denoted by \u2018believes that\nSamuel Clemens wrote <em>Huckleberry Finn</em>\u2019. One may\nconsistently suppose that the concept denoted by the former predicate\nmaps John to The True whereas the concept denoted by the latter\npredicate does not. Frege\u2019s analysis therefore preserves our\nintuition that John can believe that Mark Twain wrote <em>Huckleberry\nFinn</em> without believing that Samuel Clemens did. It also preserves\nthe Principle of Identity Substitution\u2014the fact that one cannot\nsubstitute \u2018Samuel Clemens\u2019 for \u2018Mark Twain\u2019\nwhen these names occur after propositional attitude verbs does not\nconstitute evidence against the Principle.

What distinguishes these works from valuable\ncollections like Schilpp 1963, Hintikka 1975 and Achinstein and Barker\n1979 is that the unspoken assumption, to have understood Vienna Circle\nphilosophy correctly enough so as to consider its consequences\nstraightforward, is questioned in the more recent\nscholarship. Many other pieces of new Vienna Circle scholarship are\nspread throughout philosophical journals and essay collections with\nmore systematic or wider historical scope; important work has also\nbeen done in German, Italian and French language publications but here\nmust remain unreferenced.)</p>", "<p>\nTwo facts must be clearly recognized if a proper evaluation of the\nVienna Circle is to be attempted. The first is, that, despite its\nrelatively short existence, even some of the most central theses of\nthe Vienna Circle underwent radical changes. The second is that its\nmembers were by no means of one mind in all important matters;\noccasionally they espoused perspectives so radically at variance with\neach other that even their ostensive agreements cannot remain wholly\nunquestioned. Behind the rather thin public front, then, quite\ndifferent philosophical projects were being pursued by the leading\nparticipants with, moreover, changing alliances. One way of taking\naccount of this is by speaking (as above) explicitly of the\nphilosophies (in the plural) of the Vienna Circle (and to avoid the\nsingular definite description) while using the expression\n\u201cVienna Circle philosophy\u201d (without an article) in a\nneutral generic sense.</p>", "<p>\nRecent scholarship has provided what the received view of Viennese\nneopositivism lacks: recognition and documentation of the sometimes\nsharply differentiated positions behind the generic surface. This does\nnot invalidate all previous scholarship, including some fundamental\ncriticisms of its positions, but it restores a depth to Vienna Circle\nphilosophy that was absent from the standard histories. The value of\nthis development must not be underestimated, for the recognition of\nthe Vienna Circle\u2019s sophisticated engagement with aspects of the\nphilosophical tradition and contemporaneous challenges calls into\nquestion unwarranted certainties of our own self-consciously\npost-positivist era. While there remains support for the view that\nphilosophical doctrines were held in the Vienna Circle that wholly\nmerited many of the standard criticisms to be cited below, there is\nnow also support for the view that in nearly all such cases, these\ndoctrines were already in their day opposed within the Circle itself.\nWhile some of the Vienna Circle philosophies are dated and may even\nbe, as John Passmore once put it, as dead as philosophies can be,\nothers show signs of surprising vitality. Which ones these are,\nhowever, remains a matter of debate.</p>", "<p>\nThe lead pursued in this article is provided by the comments of a\nlong-time associate of the Vienna Circle, C.G. Hempel, made in\n1991:</p>", "<blockquote>\nWhen people these days talk about logical positivism or the Vienna\nCircle and say that its ideas are pass\u00e9, this is just wrong.\nThis overlooks the fact that there were two quite different schools of\nlogical empiricism, namely the one of Carnap and Schlick and so on and\nthen the quite different one of Otto Neurath, who advocates a\ncompletely pragmatic conception of the philosophy of science\u2026.\nAnd this form of empiricism is in no way affected by any of the\nfundamental objections against logical positivism\u2026. (quoted in\nWolters 2003, 117)\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nWhile differing with Hempel\u2019s specific claim about how\nthe two \u201cschools\u201d divide, the aim here is to fill out his suggestive\npicture by indicating what Schlick, Carnap and Neurath stand for\nphilosophically and why the different wings of the Vienna Circle \nrequire differentiated assessments. After reviewing the basic facts\nand providing an overall outline of Vienna Circle philosophy (in sect.\n2), this article considers various doctrines in greater detail by way\nof discussing standard criticisms with the appropriate distinctions in\nmind (in sect. 3). No comprehensive assessment of the Vienna Circle\nand the work of its members can be attempted here, but some basic\nconclusions will be drawn (in sect. 4).</p>", "<p>\nThe Vienna Circle was a group of scientifically trained philosophers\nand philosophically interested scientists who met under the (nominal)\nleadership of Moritz Schlick for often weekly discussions of problems\nin the philosophy of science during academic terms in the years from\n1924 to 1936. As is not uncommon with such groups, its identity is\nblurred along several edges. Not all of those who ever attended the\ndiscussions can be called members, and not all who attended did so\nover the entire period. Typically, attention is focused on long-term\nregulars who gained prominence through their philosophical\npublications, but even these do not in all cases fall into the period\nof the Vienna Circle proper. It is natural, nevertheless, to consider\nunder the heading \u201cVienna Circle\u201d also the later work of\nleading members who were still active in the 1940s, 50s and 60s.\nFinally, there is the so-called periphery of international contacts\nand visitors that prefigured the post-World War II network of\nanalytical philosophers of science. In the present article the\nemphasis will be placed on the long-term regulars whose contributions\nwill be followed, selectively, into the post-Schlick era.</p>", "<p>\nAccording to its unofficial manifesto (see section 2.3 below), the\nCircle had \u201cmembers\u201d and recognized others as\n\u201csympathetic\u201d to its aims. It included as members, besides\nSchlick who had been appointed to Mach\u2019s old chair in Philosophy\nof the Inductive Sciences at the University of Vienna in 1922, the\nmathematician Hans Hahn, the physicist Philipp Frank, the social\nscientist Otto Neurath, his wife, the mathematician Olga Hahn-Neurath,\nthe philosopher Viktor Kraft, the mathematicians Theodor Radacovic and\nGustav Bergmann and, since 1926, the philosopher and logician Rudolf\nCarnap. (Even before World War I, there existed a similarly oriented\ndiscussion circle that included Frank, Hahn and Neurath. During the\ntime of the Schlick Circle, Frank resided in Prague throughout, Carnap\ndid so from 1931.) Further members were recruited among\nSchlick\u2019s students, like Friedrich Waismann, Herbert Feigl and\nMarcel Natkin, others were recruited among Hahn\u2019s students, like\nKarl Menger and Kurt G\u00f6del. Though listed as members in the\nmanifesto, Menger and Kraft later wanted to be known only as as\nsympathetic associates, like, all along, the mathematician Kurt\nReidemeister and the philosopher and historian of science Edgar\nZilsel. (Karl Popper was never a member or associate of the Circle,\nthough he studied with Hahn in the 1920s and in the early 1930s\ndiscussed its doctrines with Feigl and Carnap.) Over the years, other\nparticipants (not listed in the manifesto) included other students of\nSchlick\u2019s and Hahn\u2019s like Bela von Juhos, Josef\nSch\u00e4chter, Walter Hollitscher, Heinrich Neider, Rose Rand, Josef\nRauscher and K\u00e4the Steinhardt, a secondary teacher, Robert\nNeumann, and, as notable thinkers with independent connections, the\njurist and philosopher Felix Kaufmann (also a member of F.A. von\nHayek\u2019s \u201cGeistkreis\u201d) and the innovative\npsychologist Egon Brunswik (coming, like the even more loosely\nassociated sociologists Paul Lazarsfeld and Marie Jahoda, from the\npioneering Karl B\u00fchler\u2019s University Institute of\nPsychology).</p>", "<p>\nDespite its prominent position in the rich, if fragile, intellectual\nculture of inter-war Vienna and most likely due to its radical\ndoctrines, the Vienna Circle found itself virtually isolated in most\nof German speaking philosophy. The one exception was its contact and\ncooperation with the Berlin Society for Empirical (later: Scientific)\nPhilosophy (the other point of origin of logical empiricism). The\nmembers of the Berlin Society sported a broadly similar outlook and\nincluded, besides the philosopher Hans Reichenbach, the logicians Kurt\nGrelling and Walter Dubislav, the psychologist Kurt Lewin, the surgeon\nFriedrich Kraus and the mathematician Richard von Mises. (Its leading\nmembers Reichenbach, Grelling and Dubislav were listed in the\nCircle\u2019s manifesto as sympathisers.) At the same time, members\nof the Vienna Circle also engaged directly, if selectively, with the\nWarsaw logicians (Tarski visited Vienna in 1930, Carnap later that\nyear visited Warsaw and Tarski returned to Vienna in 1935). Probably\npartly because of its firebrand reputation, the Circle attracted also\na series of visiting younger researchers and students including Carl\nGustav Hempel from Berlin, Hasso H\u00e4rlen from Stuttgart, Ludovico\nGeymonat from Italy, J\u00f8rgen J\u00f8rgensen, Eino Kaila, Arne\nNaess and Ake Petzall from Scandinavia, A.J. Ayer from the UK, Albert\nBlumberg, Charles Morris, Ernest Nagel and W.V.O. Quine from the USA,\nH.A. Lindemann from Argentina and Tscha Hung from China. (The reports\nand recollections of these former visitors\u2014e.g. Nagel\n1936\u2014are of interest in complementing the Circle\u2019s\nin-house histories and recollections which start with the unofficial\nmanifesto\u2014Carnap, Hahn and Neurath 1929\u2014and extend through\nNeurath 1936, Frank 1941, 1949a and Feigl 1943 to the memoirs by\nCarnap 1963, Feigl 1969a, 1969b, Bergmann 1987, Menger 1994.)</p>", "<p>\nThe aforementioned social and political engagement of members of the\nVienna Circle and of Vienna Circle philosophy for Enlightenment reason\nhad never made the advancement of its associates or proteg\u00e9es\neasy in Viennese academia. From 1934 onwards, with anti-semitism\ninstitutionalized and irrationalism increasingly dominating public\ndiscourse, this engagement began to cost the Circle still more dearly.\nNot only was the Verein Ernst Mach closed down early that year for\npolitical reasons, but the ongoing dispersal of Circle members by\nemigration, forced exile and death meant that after the murder of\nSchlick in 1936 only a small rump was able to continue meetings for\nanother two years in Vienna. (1931: Feigl emigrated to USA; 1934: Hahn\ndied, Neurath fled to Holland, 1940 to UK; 1935: Carnap emigrated to\nUSA; 1936: Schlick murdered; 1937: Menger emigrated to USA, Waismann\nto UK; 1938: Frank, Kaufmann, Brunswik, Bergmann emigrated to USA;\nZilsel, Rand to UK, later to USA; Hollitscher fled to Switzerland,\nlater to UK; Sch\u00e4chter emigrated to Palestine; 1940: G\u00f6del\nemigrated to USA; see Dahms 1995 for a chronology of the exodus.) But\nthe end of the Vienna Circle as such did not mean the end of its\ninfluence due to the continuing development of the philosophy of\nformer members (and the work of Kraft in post-World War II Vienna; on\nthis see Stadler 2008). Particularly through their work in American\nexile (esp. Carnap at Harvard, Chicago and UCLA; Feigl at Iowa and\nMinnesota; less so Frank at Harvard) and that of earlier American\nvisitors (esp. Quine, Nagel), as well as through the work of fellow\nemigr\u00e9es from the Berlin Society (esp. Reichenbach, Hempel) and\ntheir students (Hilary Putnam, Wesley Salmon), logical empiricism\nstrongly influenced the post-World War II development of analytic\nphilosophy of science. By contrast, Waismann had little influence in\nthe UK where Neurath, already marginalized, had died in 1945. (The\nfull story of logical empiricism\u2019s acculturation in the English\nspeaking world remains to be written, but see Howard 2003, Reisch\n2005, Uebel 2005a, 2010, Douglas 2009, and Romizi 2012 for considerations of\naspects of Vienna Circle philosophy early and/or late that were neglected in the process\nand remained long forgotten.)</p>", "<p>\nAfter its formative phase which was confined to the Thursday evening\ndiscussions, the Circle went public in 1928 and 1929 when it seemed\nthat the time had come for their emerging philosophy to play a\ndistinctive role not only in the academic but also the public sphere.\nIn November 1928, at its founding session, Schlick accepted the\npresidency of the newly formed Verein Ernst Mach (Association Ernst\nMach), Hahn accepted one of its vice-presidencies and Neurath and\nCarnap joined its secretariat. Originally proposed by the Austrian\nFreidenkerbund (Free Thinker Association), the Verein Ernst Mach was\ndedicated to the dissemination of scientific ways of thought and so\nprovided a forum for popular lectures on the new scientific\nphilosophy. In the following year the Circle stepped out under its own\nname (invented by Neurath) with a manifesto and a special conference.\nThe publication of \u201cThe Scientific World Conception: The Vienna\nCircle\u201d, signed by Carnap, Hahn and Neurath and dedicated to\nSchlick, coincided with the \u201cFirst Conference for the\nEpistemology of the Exact Sciences\u201d in mid-September 1929,\norganised jointly with the Berlin Society as an adjunct to the Fifth\nCongress of German Physicists and Mathematicians in Prague (where\nFrank played a prominent role in the local organising committee). (On\nthe production history and early reception of the manifesto see Uebel\n2008.) A distinct philosophical school appeared to be emerging, one\nthat was dedicated to ending the previous disputes of philosophical\nschools by dismissing them, controversially, as strictly speaking\nmeaningless.</p>", "<p>\nThroughout the early and mid-1930s the Circle kept a high and\nincreasingly international profile with its numerous publications and\nconferences. In 1930, the Circle took over, again together with the\nBerlin Society, the journal <em>Annalen der Philosophie</em> and\nrestarted it under the name of <em>Erkenntnis</em> with Carnap and\nReichenbach as co-editors. (Besides publishing original articles and\nsustaining lengthy debates, this journal featured selected proceedings\nof their early conferences and documented the lecture series of the\nVerein Ernst Mach and the Berlin Society as well as their\ninternational congresses.) In addition, from 1928 until 1936, Schlick\nand Frank served as editors of their book series \u201cSchriften zur\nwissenschaftlichen Weltauffassung\u201d (\u201cWritings on the\nScientific World Conception\u201d), which published major works by\nleading members and early critics like Popper, while Neurath\nedited, from 1933 until 1939, the series\n\u201cEinheitswissenschaft\u201d (\u201cUnified Science\u201d),\nwhich published more introductory essays by leading members and\nsympathisers. Conference-wise, the Circle organized, again with the\nBerlin Society, a \u201cSecond Conference for the Epistemology of the\nExact Sciences\u201d as an adjunct to the Sixth Congress of German\nPhysicists and Mathematicians in K\u00f6nigsberg in September 1930\n(where Reidemeister played a prominent role in the organization and\nG\u00f6del first announced his incompleteness result in the\ndiscussion) and then began the series of International Congresses on\nthe Unity of Science with a \u201cPre-Conference\u201d just prior to\nthe start of the Eighth International Congress of Philosophy in Prague\nin September 1934. This, their last conference in Central Europe, was\nfollowed by the International Congresses of various sizes in Paris\n(September 1935, July 1937), Copenhagen (June 1936), Cambridge,\nEngland (July 1938), Cambridge, Mass. (September 1939), all in the\nmain organized by Neurath; a smaller last gathering was held in\nChicago in September 1941. By 1938 their collective publication\nactivity began to centre on a monumentally planned <em>International\nEncyclopedia of Unified Science</em>, with Neurath as editor-in-chief\nand Carnap and Charles Morris as co-editors; by the time of\nNeurath\u2019s death in 1945, only 10 monographs had appeared and the\nseries was wound up in 1970 numbering 20 monographs under the title\n\u201cFoundations of the Unity of Science\u201d (notably containing\nThomas Kuhn\u2019s <em>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em>\namongst them).</p>", "<p>\nIndividually, the members of the Vienna Circle published extensively\nbefore, during and after the years of the Circle around Schlick. For\nsome (Frank, Hahn, Menger, Neurath), philosophy was only part of their\nscientific output, with numerous monographs and articles in their\nrespective disciplines (mathematics, physics and social science);\nothers (Schlick, Carnap, Feigl, Waismann) concentrated on philosophy,\nbut even their output cared relatively little for traditional concerns\nof the field. Here it must be noted that two early monographs by\nSchlick (1918/25) and Carnap (1928a), commonly associated with the\nVienna Circle, mostly predate their authors\u2019 participation there\nand exhibit a variety of influences not typically associated with\nlogical positivism (see section 3.7 below). Moreover, important\nmonographs by Frank (1932), Neurath (1931a), Carnap (1934/37) and\nMenger (1934) in the first half of the 1930s represent moves away from\npositions that had been held in the Circle before and contradict its\northodox profile. Yet the Circle\u2019s orthodoxy, as it were, is not\neasily pinned down either. Schlick himself was critical of the\nmanifesto of 1929 and gave a brief vision statement of his own in\n\u201cThe Turning Point in Philosophy\u201d (1930). A long-planned\nbook by Waismann of updates on Wittgenstein\u2019s thought, to which\nSchlick was extremely sympathetic, was never completed as originally\nplanned and only appeared posthumously (Waismann 1965; for earlier\nmaterial see Baker 2003). Comparison with rough transcripts of the\nCircle\u2019s discussions in the early 1930s (for transcripts from\nbetween December 1930 and July 1931 see Stadler 1997 [2015,\n69\u2013123]) suggest that Waismann\u2019s Wittgensteinian\n\u201cTheses\u201d, dated\nto \u201caround 1930\u201d (Waismann 1967 [1979, Appendix B]), come closest\nto an elaboration of the orthodox Circle position at that time (but\nwhich remained not undisputed even then). Again, what needs to be\nstressed is that all of the Circle\u2019s publications are to be\nunderstood as contributions to ongoing discussions among its members\nand associates.</p>", "<p>\nDespite the pluralism of the Vienna Circle\u2019s views, there did\nexist a minimal consensus which may be put as follows. A theory of\nscientific knowledge was propagated which sought to renew empiricism\nby freeing it from the impossible task of justifying the claims of the\nformal sciences. It will be noted that this updating did not leave\nempiricism unchanged.</p>", "<p>\nFollowing the logicism of Frege and Russell, the Circle considered\nlogic and mathematics to be analytic in nature. Extending\nWittgenstein\u2019s insight about logical truths to mathematical ones\nas well, the Circle considered both to be tautological. Like true\nstatements of logic, mathematical statements did not express factual\ntruths: devoid of empirical content they only concerned ways of\nrepresenting the world, spelling out implication relations between\nstatements. The knowledge claims of logic and mathematics gained their\njustification on purely formal grounds, by proof of their derivability\nby stated rules from stated axioms and premises. (Depending on the\nstanding of these axioms and premises, justification was conditional\nor unconditional.) Thus defanged of appeals to rational intuition, the\ncontribution of pure reason to human knowledge (in the form of logic\nand mathematics) was thought easily integrated into the empiricist\nframework. (Carnap sought to accommodate G\u00f6del\u2019s\nincompleteness results by separating analyticity from effective\nprovability and by postulating that arithmetic consisted of an\ninfinite series of ever richer arithmetical languages; see the\ndiscussion and references in section 3.2 below.)</p>", "<p>\nThe synthetic statements of the empirical sciences meanwhile were held\nto be cognitively meaningful if and only if they were empirically\ntestable in some sense. They derived their justification as knowledge\nclaims from successful tests. Here the Circle appealed to a criterion of meaningfulness\n(cognitive significance) the correct formulation of which was problematical and much\ndebated (and will be discussed in greater detail in section 3.1\nbelow). Roughly, if synthetic statements failed testability in\nprinciple they were considered to be cognitively meaningless and to\ngive rise only to pseudo-problems. No third category of significance\nbesides that of <em>a priori</em> analytical and <em>a posteriori</em>\nsynthetic statements was admitted: in particular, Kant\u2019s\nsynthetic <em>a priori</em> was banned as having been refuted by the\nprogress of science itself. (The theory of relativity showed what had\nbeen held to be an example of the synthetic <em>a priori</em>, namely\nEuclidean geometry, to be false as the geometry of physical space.)\nThus the Circle rejected the knowledge claims of metaphysics as being\nneither analytic and <em>a priori</em> nor empirical and synthetic.\n(On related but different grounds, they also rejected the knowledge\nclaims of normative ethics: whereas conditional norms could be\ngrounded in means-ends relations, unconditional norms remained\nunprovable in empirical terms and so depended crucially on the\ndisputed substantive <em>a priori</em> intuition.)</p>", "<p>\nGiven their empiricism, all of the members of the Vienna Circle also\ncalled into question the principled separation of the natural and the\nhuman sciences. They were happy enough to admit to differences in\ntheir object domains, but denied the categorical difference in both\ntheir overarching methodologies and ultimate goals in inquiry, which\nthe historicist tradition in the still only emerging social sciences\nand the idealist tradition in philosophy insisted on. The\nCircle\u2019s own methodologically monist position was sometimes\nrepresented under the heading of \u201cunified science\u201d.\nPrecisely how such a unification of the sciences was to be effected or\nunderstood remained a matter for further discussion (see section 3.3\nbelow).</p>", "<p>\nIt is easy to see that, combined with the rejection of rational\nintuition, the Vienna Circle\u2019s exclusive apportionment of reason\ninto either formal <em>a priori</em> reasoning, issuing in analytic\ntruths (or contradictions), and substantive <em>a posteriori</em>\nreasoning, issuing in synthetic truths (or falsehoods), severely\nchallenged the traditional understanding of philosophy. All members of\nthe Circle hailed the end of distinctive philosophical system\nbuilding. In line with the <em>Tractatus</em> claim that all\nphilosophy is really a critique of language, the Vienna Circle took\nthe so-called linguistic turn, the turn to representation as the\nproper subject matter of philosophy. Philosophy itself was denied a\nseparate first-order domain of expertise and declared a second-order\ninquiry. Whether the once queen of the sciences was thereby reduced to\nthe mere handmaiden of the latter was still left open. It remained a\nmatter of disagreement what type of distinctively\nphilosophical insight, if any, would remain legitimate. Just as\nimportantly, however, the tools of modern logic were employed also for\nmetatheoretical construction, not just for the reduction of empirical\nclaims to their observational base or, more generally, for the\nderivation of their observational consequences. For the price of\nabandoning foundationalist certainty this allowed for an enormous\nexpansion of the domain of empirical discourse. Ultimately, it opened\nthe space for the still ongoing discussions of scientific realism and\nits alternatives (see section 3.4 below).</p>", "<p>\nThe Circle\u2019s leading protagonists differed in how they\nconceptualized this reflexive second-order inquiry that the linguistic\nturn had inaugurated. Nevertheless, they all agreed broadly that the\nways of representing the world were largely determined by convention.\nA multitude of ideas hide behind this invocation of conventionality.\nOne particularly radical one is the denial of the apodicity of all\napriority, the denial of the claim that knowledge justified through\nreason alone represents truths that are unconditionally necessary.\nAnother one is the imputation of agency in the construction of the\nlogico-linguistic frameworks that make human cognition possible, the\ndenial that conventionality could only mean acquiescence in tradition.\nWhether such ideas were followed by individual members of the Circle,\nhowever, depended on their own interests and influences. It is these\noften overlooked or misunderstood differences that hold the key to\nunderstanding the interplay of occasionally incompatible positions\nthat make up Vienna Circle philosophy. (As can be seen from some of\ntheir internal disputes, moreover, these differences were also not\nalways obvious to the protagonists themselves.)</p>", "<p>\nTo see a striking example, consider their overarching conceptions of\nphilosophy itself. Some protagonists retained the idea that philosophy\npossessed a separate disciplinary identity from science and, like\nSchlick, turned philosophy into a distinctive, albeit non-formal\nactivity of meaning determination. Others, like Carnap, agreed on the\ndistinction between philosophy and science but turned philosophy into\na purely formal enterprise, the so-called logic of science. Still\nothers went even further and, like Neurath under the banner of\n\u201cunified science\u201d, also rejected philosophy as a separate\ndiscipline and treated what remained of it, after the rejection of\nmetaphysics, as its partly empirical meta-theory, to be set beside the logic of science. With Schlick, then,\nphilosophy became the activity of achieving a much clarified and\ndeepened understanding of the cognitive and linguistic practices\nactually already employed in science and everyday discourse. By\ncontrast, for Carnap, philosophy investigated and reconstructed\nexisting language fragments, developed new logico-linguistic\nframeworks and suggested possible formal conventions for science,\nwhile, for Neurath, the investigation of science was pursued by an\ninterdisciplinary meta-theory that encompassed empirical disciplines,\nagain with a pragmatic orientation. Thus we find in apparent\ncompetition different conceptions of post-metaphysical philosophy: the\nprojects of experiential meaning determination, of formal rational\nreconstruction and of naturalistic explications of leading theoretical\nand methodological notions. (For roughly representative early\nessay-length statements of their positions see Schlick 1930, Carnap\n1932a and Neurath 1932a; later restatements are given in Schlick 1937,\nCarnap 1936b and Neurath 1936b.) In the more detailed discussions\nbelow these differences of overall approach will figure repeatedly\n(see also section 3.6 below).</p>", "<p>\nCriticisms of the basic positions adopted in the Vienna Circle are\nlegion, though it may be questioned whether most of them took account\nof the sophisticated variations on offer. (Sometimes the\nCircle\u2019s own writings are disregarded altogether and\n\u201clogical positivism\u201d is discussed only via the proxy of\nAyer\u2019s popular exposition; see, e.g., Soames 2003.) But some\nNeo-Kantians like Ernst Cassirer may claim that they too accepted\ndevelopments like the merely relative <em>a priori</em> and an\nappropriate conception of the historical development of science.\nLikewise, Wittgensteinians may claim that Wittgenstein\u2019s own\nopposition to metaphysics only concerned false attempts to render it\nintelligible: his merely ineffable but uneliminated metaphysics\nconcerned precisely what for him were essentials of ways of\nrepresenting the world. The commonest criticisms, however, concerned\nnot the uniqueness of the Vienna Circle\u2019s doctrines, or their\nfaithfulness to their supposed sources, but whether they were tenable\nat all. Prominent objects of this type of criticism include the\nverificationist theory of meaning and its claimed anti-metaphysical\nand non-cognitivist consequences as well as its own significance; the\nreductionism in phenomenalist or physicalist guises that appeared to\nattend the Circle\u2019s attempted operationalisation of the logical\natomism of Russell and Wittgenstein; and the Circle\u2019s alleged\nscientism in general and their formalist and a-historical conception\nof scientific cognition in particular. These criticisms are discussed\nin some detail below in order to assess why which of the associated\ndoctrines remain of what importance.</p>", "<p>\nAs noted, the Vienna Circle did not last long: its philosophical\nrevolution came at a cost. Yet what was so socially, indeed\npolitically, explosive about what appears on first sight to be a\nparticularly arid, if not astringent, doctrine of specialist\nscientific knowledge? To a large part, precisely what made it so\ncontroversial philosophically: its claim to refute opponents not by\nproving their statements to be false but by showing them to be\n(cognitively) meaningless. Whatever the niceties of their\nphilosophical argument here, the socio-political impact of the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s philosophies of science was obvious and profound. All\nof them opposed the increasing groundswell of radically mistaken,\nindeed irrational, ways of thinking about thought and its place in the\nworld. In their time and place, the mere demand that public discourse\nbe perspicuous, in particular, that reasoning be valid and premises\ntrue\u2014a demand implicit in their general ideal of\nreason\u2014placed them in the middle of crucial socio-political\nstruggles. Some members and sympathisers of the Circle also actively\nopposed the then increasingly popular <em>v\u00f6lkisch</em>\nsupra-individual holism in social science as a dangerous intellectual\naberration. Not only did such ideas support racism and fascism in\npolitics, but such ideas themselves were supported only by radically\nmistaken arguments concerning the nature and explanation of organic\nand unorganic matter. So the first thing that made all of the Vienna\nCircle philosophies politically relevant was the contingent fact that\nin their day much political discourse exhibited striking epistemic\ndeficits. That some of the members of the Circle went, without logical\nblunders, still further by arguing that socio-political considerations\ncan play a legitimate role in some instances of theory choice due to\nunderdetermination is yet another matter. This particular issue will\nnot be pursued further here (see references at the end of section 2.1\nabove), nor the general topic of the Circle\u2019s embedding in\nmodernism and the discourse of modernity (see Putnam 1981b for a\nreductionist, Galison 1990 for a foundationalist, Uebel 1996 for a\nconstructivist reading of their modernism, Dahms 2004 for an account\nof personal relations with representatives of modernism in art and\narchitecture).</p>", "<p>\nGiven only the outlines of Vienna Circle philosophy, its controversial\ncharacter is evident. The boldness of its claims made it attractive\nbut that boldness also seemed to be its undoing. Turning to the\nquestions of how far and, if at all, which forms of Vienna Circle\nphilosophy stand up to some common criticisms, both the synchronic\nvariations and the diachronic trajectories of its variants must be\ntaken into account. This will be attempted in the sections below.</p>", "<p>\nBefore expectations are raised too high, however, it must also\nremembered that in this article only the views of members of the\nVienna Circle can be discussed, even though the problematic issues\nwere pervasive in logical empiricism generally. (Compare the SEP article \u201cLogical Empiricism\u201d; for articles on\nReichenbach see, e.g, Spohn 1991 and Salmon and Wolters 1994,\nRichardson 2005, 2006, and, for the Berlin Group as a whole, Milkov and Peckhaus 2013.) Moreover, here\nthe emphasis must lie on the main protagonists: Schlick, Carnap and\nNeurath. (Neither Hahn or Frank, nor Waismann or Feigl, for instance,\ncan be discussed here as extensively as their work deserves; see,\ne.g., Uebel 2005b, 2011b, McGuinness 2011, Haller 2003, respectively.)\nWhat will be noted, however, is that Vienna Circle philosophy was by\nno means identical with the post-World War II logical empiricism that\nhas come to be known as the \u201creceived view\u201d of scientific\ntheories, even though it would be hard to imagine the latter without\nthe former. (For a systematic if schematic critical discussion of the\nreceived view, see Suppe 1977, for a partial defense Mormann\n2007a.)</p>", "<p>\nTo deepen the somewhat cursory overview of Vienna Circle philosophy\ngiven above, we now turn to the discussion of the following issues:\nfirst, the viability of the conceptions of empirical significance\nemployed by the Vienna Circle in its classical period; second, its uses of\nthe analytic-synthetic distinction; third, its supposedly reductionist\ndesigns and foundationalist ambitions for philosophy; fourth, its\nstances in the debate about realism or anti-realism with regard to the\ntheoretical terms in science; fifth, Carnap\u2019s later ideas in\nresponse to some of the problems encountered; sixth, the issue of the\nstatus of the meaning criterion itself (variably referred to also as \u201ccriterion of significance\u201d or \u201ccriterion of empirical significance\u201d) and of the point of their\ncritique of metaphysics; seventh, the Vienna Circle\u2019s attitude\ntowards history and of their own place in the history of\nphilosophy.</p>", "<p>\nThese topics have been chosen for the light their investigation throws\non the Circle\u2019s own agendas and the reception of its doctrines\namongst philosophers at large, as well as for the relative ease with\nwhich their discussion allows its development and legacy to be\ncharted. There can be little doubt about the enormous impact that the\nmembers of the Vienna Circle had on the development of\ntwentieth-century philosophy. What is less clear is whether any of its\ndistinctive doctrines are left standing once the dust of their\ndiscussion has settled or whether those of its teachings that were\ndeemed defensible merged seamlessly into the broad church that\nanalytic philosophy has become (and, if so, what those surviving\ndoctrines and teachings may be).</p>", "<p>\nIt must be noted, then, that the topics chosen for this article do not\nexhaust the issues concerning which the members of the Vienna Circle\nmade significant contributions (which continue to stimulate work in\nthe history of philosophy of science). Important topics like that of\nthe theory and practice of unified science, of the nature of the\nempirical basis of science (the so-called protocol-sentence debate)\nand of the general structure of the theories of individual sciences\ncan only be touched upon selectively. Likewise, while the general\ntopic of ethical non-cognitivism receives only passing mentions, the\nCircle\u2019s varied approaches to value theory cannot be discussed\nhere (for an overview see Rutte 1986, for detailed analyses see Siegetsleitner 2014). Other matters, like the\ncontributions made by Vienna Circle members to the development of\nprobability theory and inductive logic, the philosophy of logic and\nmathematics (apart from the guiding ideas of Carnap) and to the\nphilosophy of individual empirical sciences (physics, biology,\npsychology, social science), cannot be discussed at all (see Creath\nand Friedman 2007 and Richardson and Uebel 2007 for relevant essays with further references).\nBut it may be noted that with his \u201clogic of science\u201d\nCarnap counts among the pioneers of what nowadays is called\n\u201cformal epistemology\u201d.</p>", "<p>\nNot surprisingly, it was the Circle\u2019s rejection of metaphysics\nby means of their seemingly devastating criterion of cognitive\nsignificance that attracted immediate opposition. (That they did not\ndeny all meaning to statements thus ruled out of court was freely\nadmitted from early on, but this \u201cexpressive\u201d surplus was\nconsidered secondary to so-called \u201ccognitive\u201d meaning and\ndiscountable in science (see Carnap 1928b, 1932a).) Notwithstanding\nthe metaphysicans\u2019 thunder, however, the most telling criticisms\nof the criterion came from within the Circle or broadly sympathetic\nphilosophers. When it was protested that failure to meet an empiricist\ncriterion of significance did not make philosophical statements\nmeaningless, members of the Circle simply asked for an account of what\nthis non-empirical and presumably non-emotive meaning consisted in and\ntypically received no convincing answer. The weakness of their\nposition was rather that their own criterion of empirical significance\nseemed to resist an acceptable formal characterization.</p>", "<p>\nTo start with, it must be noted that long before the verification\nprinciple proper entered the Circle\u2019s discourse in the late 1920s,\nthe thought expressed by Mach\u2019s dictum that \u201cwhere neither\nconfirmation nor refutation is possible, science is not\nconcerned\u201d (1883 [1960, 587]) was accepted as a basic precept of\ncritical reflection about science. Responsiveness to evidence for and\nagainst a claim was the hallmark of scientific discourse.\n(Particularly the group Frank-Hahn-Neurath, who formed part of a\npre-World War I discussion group (Frank 1941, 1949a) sometimes called\nthe \u201cFirst Vienna Circle\u201d (Haller 1985, Uebel 2003), can\nbe presumed to be familiar with Mach\u2019s criterion.) Beyond this,\nstill in the 1920s, Schlick (1926) convicted metaphysics for falsely\ntrying to express as logically structured cognition what is but the\ninexpressible qualitative content of experience. Already then,\nhowever, Carnap (1928b, \u00a77) edged towards a formal criterion by\nrequiring empirically significant statements to be such that\nexperiential support for them or for their negation is at least\nconceivable. Meaningfulness meant the possession of \u201cfactual\ncontent\u201d which could not, on pain of rendering many scientific\nhypotheses meaningless, be reduced to actual testability. Instead, the\nempirical significance of a statement had to be conceived of as\npossession of the potential to receive direct or indirect experiential\nsupport (via deductive or inductive reasoning).</p>", "<p>\nIn 1930, considerations of this sort appeared to receive a\nconsiderable boost due to Waismann\u2019s reports of\nWittgenstein\u2019s meetings with him and Schlick. Wittgenstein had\ndiscussed the thesis \u201cThe sense of a proposition is [the method of] its\nverification\u201d in conversations with Schlick and Waismann on 22\nDecember 1929 and 2 January 1930 (see Waismann 1967 [1979, 47 and 79]) and Waismann elaborated it in his \u201cTheses\u201d which were presented to the Circle as\nWittgenstein\u2019s considered views. While Wittgenstein appears to have\nthought of his dictum primarily as a constitutive principle of meaning, in the Circle it was put to work mainly as a demarcation criterion against metaphysics. Whether it was always noted that Wittgenstein\u2019s thesis and the criterion of cognitive significance must be distinguished (the former entails the latter, but not vice versa) may be doubted, but striking differences emerged all the same. Like Carnap\u2019s criterion of significance of 1928, the version of the criterion which followed from Wittgenstein\u2019s dictum also allowed for\nverifiability in principle (and did not demand actual\nverifiability): like Carnap\u2019s notion of experiential support, it worked with the mere conceivability of verifiability. Yet Wittgenstein\u2019s criterion required conclusive verifiability which Carnap\u2019s did not. (The demand for conclusive verifiability was discussed in the meetings\nwith Wittgenstein.) By 1931, however, it had become clear to some that\nthis would not do. What Carnap later called the \u201cliberalization\nof empiricism\u201d was underway and different camps became\ndiscernible within the Circle. It was over this issue that the\nso-called \u201cleft wing\u201d with Carnap, Hahn, Frank and Neurath\nfirst distinguished itself from the \u201cmore conservative\nwing\u201d around Schlick. (See Carnap 1936\u201337, 422 and 1963a,\n\u00a79. Carnap 1936\u201337, 37n dated the opposition to strict\nverificationism to \u201cabout 1931\u201d.)</p>", "<p>\nIn the first place, this liberalization meant the accommodation of\nuniversally quantified statements and the return, as it were, to\nsalient aspects of Carnap\u2019s 1928 conception. Everybody had noted\nthat Wittgenstein\u2019s criterion rendered\nuniversally quantified statements meaningless. Schlick (1931) thus\nfollowed Wittgenstein\u2019s own suggestion to treat \u201chypotheses\u201d instead as\nrepresenting rules for the formation of verifiable singular\nstatements. (His abandonment of conclusive verifiability is indicated\nonly in Schlick 1936a.) By contrast, Hahn (1933, drawn from lectures\nin 1932) pointed out that hypotheses should be counted as properly\nmeaningful as well and that the criterion be weakened to allow for\nless than conclusive verifiability. But other elements played into\nthis liberalization as well. One that began to do so soon was the\nrecognition of the problem of the irreducibility of disposition terms\nto observation terms (more on this presently). A third element was\nthat disagreement arose as to whether the in-principle verifiability\nor support turned on what was merely logically possible or on what was\nnomologically possible, as a matter of physical law etc. A fourth\nelement, finally, was that differences emerged as to whether the\ncriterion of significance was to apply to all languages or whether it\nwas to apply primarily to constructed, formal languages. Schlick\nretained the focus on logical possibility and natural languages\nthroughout, but Carnap had firmly settled his focus on nomological\npossibility and constructed languages by the mid-thirties. Concerned\nwith natural language, Schlick (1932, 1936a) deemed all statements\nmeaningful for which it was logically possible to conceive of a\nprocedure of verification; concerned with constructed languages only,\nCarnap (1936\u201337) deemed meaningful only statements for whom it\nwas nomologically possible to conceive of a procedure of confirmation\nof disconfirmation.</p>", "<p>\nMany of these issues were openly discussed at the Paris congress in\n1935. Already in 1932 Carnap had sought to sharpen his previous\ncriterion by stipulating that those statements were meaningful that\nwere syntactically well-formed and whose non-logical terms were\nreducible to terms occurring in the basic observational evidence\nstatements of science. While Carnap\u2019s focus on the reduction of\ndescriptive terms allows for the conclusive verification of some\nstatements, it must be noted that his criterion also allowed\nuniversally quantified statements to be meaningful in general, provided they were\nsyntactically and terminologically correct (1932a, \u00a72). It was\nnot until one of his Paris addresses, however, that Carnap officially\ndeclared the criterion of cognitive significance to be mere confirmability.\nCarnap\u2019s new criterion required neither verification nor\nfalsification but only partial testability so as now to include not\nonly universal statements but also the disposition statements of\nscience (see Carnap 1936\u201337; the English translation of the\noriginal Paris address (1936a [1949]) combines it with extraneous\nmaterial). These disposition terms were thought to be linked to\nobservation statements by a variety of reduction postulates or longer\nreduction chains, all of which provided only partial definitions\n(despite their name they provided no eliminative reductions). Though\nplausible initially, the device of introducing non-observational terms\nin this way gave rise to a number of difficulties which impugned the\nsupposedly clear distinctions between logical and empirical matters\nand analytic and synthetic statements (Hempel 1951, 1963).\nIndependently, Carnap himself (1939) soon gave up the hope that all\ntheoretical terms of science could be related to an observational base\nby such reduction chains. This admission raised a serious problem for\nthe formulation of a criterion of cognitive significance: how was one to rule out\nunwanted metaphysical claims while admitting as significant highly\nabstract scientific claims?</p>", "<p>\nConsider that Carnap (1939, 1956b) admitted as legitimate theoretical\nterms that are implicitly defined in calculi that are\nonly partially interpreted by correspondence rules between\nsome select calculus terms and expressions belonging to an\nobservational language (via non-eliminative reductions). The problem\nwas that mere confirmability was simply too weak a criterion\nto rule out some putative metaphysical claims. Moreover, this problem\narose for both the statement-based approach to the criterion (taken by\nCarnap in 1928, by Wittgenstein in 1929/30, and by Ayer both in the\nfirst (1936) and the second editions (1946) of <em>Language Truth and\nLogic</em>) and for the term-based approach (taken by Carnap since\n1932). For the former approach, the problem was that the empirical\nlegitimacy of statements obtained via indirect testing also\ntransferred to any expressions that could be truth-functionally\nconjoined to them (for instance, by the rule of\n\u2018or\u2019-introduction). Statements thus became empirically\nsignificant, however vacuous they had been on their own. For the\nterm-based approach, the problem was that, given the non-eliminability\nof dispositional and theoretical terms, empirical significance was no\nlonger ascribable to individual expressions in isolation but became a\nholistic affair, with little guarantee in turn for the empiricist\nlegitimacy of all the terms now involved.</p>", "<p>\nFor most critics (even within the ranks of logical empiricism), the\nproblem of ruling out metaphysical statements while retaining the\nterms of high theory remained unsolved. By 1950, in response to the\ntroubles of Ayer\u2019s two attempts to account for the indirect\ntesting of theoretical statements via their consequences, Hempel\nconceded that it was \u201cuseless to continue to search for an\nadequate criterion of testability in terms of deductive relationships\nto observation sentences\u201d (1950 [1959, 116]). The following\nyear, Hempel also abandoned the idea of using, as a criterion of\nempirical significance, Carnap\u2019s method of translatability into\nan antecedently determined empirical language consisting only of\nobservational non-logical vocabulary. Precisely because it was\nsuitably liberalized to allow abstract scientific theories with merely\npartial interpretations, its anti-metaphysical edge was blunted: it\nallowed for combination with \u201csome set of metaphysical\npropositions, even if the latter have no empirical interpretation at\nall\u201d (1951, 70). Hempel drew the holistic conclusion that the\nunits of empirical significance were entire theories and that the\nmeasure of empirical significance itself was multi-criterial and,\nmoreover, allowed for degrees of significance. To many, this amounted\nto the demise of the Circle\u2019s anti-metaphysical campaign. By\ncontrast, Feigl\u2019s reaction (1956) was to reduce the ambition of\nthe criterion of significance to the mere provision of necessary\nconditions.</p>", "<p>\nSome further work was undertaken on rescuing and, again, debunking a\nversion of the statement-based criterion, but mostly not by (former) members\nof the Vienna Circle. However, in response to the problem of how to\nformulate a meaning criterion that suitably distinguished between\nempirically significant and insignificant non-observational terms,\nCarnap proposed a new solution in 1956. We\nwill return to discuss it separately (see section 3.5 below); for\nnow we need only note that these proposals were highly technical and\napplied only to axiomatized theories in formal languages. They too,\nhowever, found not much favor amongst philosophers. Yet whatever the\nproblems that may or may not beset them, it would seem that far more\ngeneral philosophical considerations contributed to the disappearance\nof the problem of the criterion of cognitive significance from most philosophical\ndiscussions since the early 1960s (other than as an example of\nmistaken positivism). These include the increasing opposition to the\ndistinctions between analytic and synthetic statements and\nobservational and theoretical terms as well as a general sense of\ndissatisfaction with Carnap\u2019s approach to philosophy which began\nto seem both too formalist in execution and too deflationary in\nambition. The entire philosophical program of which the search for a\nprecise criterion of empirical significance was a part had begun to\nfall out of favor (and with it technical discussions about the\ncriterion\u2019s latest version).</p>", "<p>\nThe widely perceived collapse of the classical Viennese project to\nfind in an empiricist meaning criterion a demarcation criterion\nagainst metaphysics\u2014we reserve judgement about Carnap\u2019s\nlast two proposals here\u2014can be interpreted in a variety of ways.\nIt strongly suggests that cognitive significance cannot be reduced to\nwhat is directly observable, whether that be interpreted in\nphenomenalist or intersubjective, physicalist terms. In that important\nbut somewhat subsidiary sense, the collapse spelt the failure of many\nof the reductivist projects typically ascribed to Viennese\nneopositivism (but see section 3.3 below). Beyond that, what actually\nhad failed was the attempt to characterize for natural languages the\nclass of cognitively significant propositions by recursive definitions\nin purely logical terms, either by relations of deducibility or\ntranslatability. What failed, in other words, was the attempt to apply\na general conception of philosophical analysis as purely formal,\npursued also in other areas, to the problem of characterizing\nmeaningfulness.</p>", "<p>\nThis general conception can be considered formalist in several senses.\nIt was formalist, first, in demanding the analysis of the meaning of\nconcepts and propositions in terms of logically necessary and\nsufficient conditions: it was precise and brooked no exceptions. And\nit was formalist, second, in demanding that such analyses be given\nsolely in terms of the logical relations of these concepts and\npropositions to other concepts and propositions: it used the tools of\nformal logic. There is also a third sense that is, however, applicable\npredominantly to the philosophical project in Carnap\u2019s hands, in\nthat it was formalist since it concentrated on the analysis of\ncontested concepts via their explication in formal languages.\n(Discussion of its viability must be deferred until sections 3.5 and\n3.6 below, since what\u2019s at issue currently is only the formalist\nproject as applied to concepts in natural language.) The question\narises whether all Vienna Circle philosophers concerned with empirical\nsignificance in natural language were equally affected, for the\ncollapse of the formalist project may leave as yet untouched other\nways of sustaining the objection that metaphysics is, in some relevant\nsense, cognitively insignificant. (Such philosophers in turn would\nhave to answer the charge, of course, that only the formalist project\nof showing metaphysics strictly meaningless rendered the Viennese\nanti-metaphysics distinctive.)</p>", "<p>\nEven though the formalist project became identified with mainstream\nlogical empiricism generally (consider its prominence in confirmation\ntheory and in the theory of explanation), it was not universally\nsubscribed to in the Vienna Circle itself. In different ways, neither\nSchlick nor Neurath or Frank adhered to it. As noted in the overview\nabove, Schlick\u2019s attempts to exhibit natural language meaning\nabjured efforts to characterize it in explicitly formal terms, even\nthough he accepted the demand for necessary and sufficient conditions\nof significance. In the end, moreover, Schlick turned away from his\ncolleagues\u2019 search for a criterion of empirical significance. In\nallowing talk of life after death as meaningful (1936a), for the very\nreason that what speaks against it is only the empirical impossibility\nof verifying such talk, Schlick\u2019s final criterion clearly left\nempiricist strictures behind.</p>", "<p>\nBy contrast, Neurath and Frank kept their focus on empirical\nsignificance. While they rarely discussed these matters explicitly,\ntheir writings give the impression that Neurath and Frank chose to\nadopt (if not retain) a contextual, exemplar-based approach to\ncharacterizing the criterion of meaninglessness and so decided to\nforego the enumeration of necessary and sufficient conditions.\nMach\u2019s precept cited earlier is an example of such a pragmatic\napproach, as is, it should be noted, Peirce\u2019s criterion of\nsignificance, endorsed by Quine (1969), which claims that significance\nconsists in making a discernible difference whether a proposition is\nlikely to be true or false. Mach\u2019s pragmatic approach had been\nchampioned already before verificationism proper by Neurath, Frank and\nHahn who became, like Carnap, early opponents of conclusive\nverifiability. (Indeed, it is doubtful whether Neurath\u2019s radical\nfallibilism, most clearly expressed already in 1913, ever wavered.)\nThis pragmatic understanding found clear expression in Neurath\u2019s\nadoption (1935a, 1938) of K. Reach\u2019s formulation of metaphysical\nstatements as \u201cisolated\u201d ones, as statements that do not\nderive from and hold no consequences for those statements that we do\naccept on the basis of empirical evidence or for logical reasons.\n(Hempel\u2019s dismissal, in 1951, of this pragmatic indicator\npresupposes the desiderata of the formalist project.) Finally, there\nis Frank\u2019s suggestion (1963), coupled with his longstanding\nadvice to combine logical empiricism with pragmatism, that\nCarnap\u2019s purely logical critique of metaphysics in (1932a) was\nbound to remain ineffective as long as the actual use of metaphysics\nremained unexamined. It would be worth investigating whether\u2014if\nthe critique of the alleged reductionist ambitions of their philosophy\ncould also be deflected (see section 3.3 below)\u2014the impetus of\nthe anti-verificationist critique can be absorbed by those with a\npragmatic approach to the demarcation against metaphysics. Much as\nwith Quine\u2019s Peirce, such a criterion rules out as without\ninterest for epistemic activity all concepts and propositions whose\ntruth or falsity make no appreciable difference to the sets of\nconcepts and propositions we do accept already.</p>", "<p>\nAn entirely different moral was drawn by Reichenbach (1938) and\nthinkers indebted to his probabilistic conception of meaning and his\nprobabilistic version of verificationism, which escaped the criticisms\nsurveyed above by vagaries of its own. Such theorists perceive the\nfailure of the formalist model to accommodate the empirical\nsignificance of theoretical terms to stem from its so-called deductive\nchauvinism. In place of the exclusive reliance on the\nhypothetical-deductive method these theorists employ non-demonstrative\nanalogical and causal inductive reasoning to ground theoretical\nstatements empirically. Like Salmon, these theorists adopt a form of\n\u201cnon-linguistic empiricism\u201d which they sharply\ndifferentiate from the empiricism of the Vienna Circle (Salmon 1985,\n2003 and Parrini 1998).</p>", "<p>\nNow against both the pragmatic and the post-linguistic responses to\nthe perceived failure of the attempt to provide a precise formal\ncriterion of significance serious worries can be raised. Thus it must\nbe asked whether without a precise way of determining when a statement\n\u2018makes an appreciable difference\u2019, criticism of\nmetaphysics based on such a criterion may be not be considered as a\nbiased dismissal rather than a demonstration of fact and so fall short\nof what is needed. Likewise in the case of the anti-deductivist\nresponse, it must be noted that a criterion based on analogical\nreasoning will only be as effective as the strength of the analogy\nwhich can always be criticized as inapt (and similarly for appeals to\ncausal reasoning). The very point of exact philosophy in a scientific\nspirit\u2014for many the very point of Vienna Circle philosophy\nitself\u2014seems threatened by such maneuvres. Acquiescence in the\nperceived failure of the proposed criteria of significance thus comes\nwith a price: if not that of abandoning Vienna Circle philosophy\naltogether, then at least that of formulating an alternative\nunderstanding to how some of its ambitions ought to be understood.\n(Recent reconstructive work on Carnap, Neurath and Frank may be\nregarded in this light.)</p>", "<p>\nA still different response\u2014but one emblematic for the\nphilosophical public at large\u2014is that of another of\nReichenbach\u2019s former students, Putnam, who came to reject\nthe anti-metaphysical project that powered verificationism in its\nentirety. Repeatedly in his later years, Putnam called for a\nrefashioning of analytic philosophy as such, providing, as it were, a\nphilosophically conservative counterweight to Rorty\u2019s turn to\npostmodernism. Putnam\u2019s reasons (the alleged self-refutation of\nthe meaning criterion) are still different from those surveyed above\nand will be discussed when we return to reconsider the very point of\nthe Circle\u2019s campaign against metaphysics (see section 3.6\nbelow).</p>", "<p>\nWhether the verificationist agenda was pursued in a formalist or\npragmatic vein, however, all members shared the belief that meaningful\nstatements divided exclusively into analytic and synthetic statements\nwhich, when asserted, were strictly matched with <em>a priori</em> and\n<em>a posteriori</em> reasoning for their support. The Vienna Circle\nwielded this pairing of epistemic and semantic notions as a weapon not\nonly against the substantive <em>a priori</em> of the Schoolmen but\nalso against Kant\u2019s synthetic <em>a priori</em>. Moreover, their\nnotion of analyticity comprized both logical and mathematical truths,\nthereby extending Wittgenstein\u2019s understanding of the former as\n\u201ctautological\u201d in support of a broadly logicist\nprogram.</p>", "<p>\nIt is well known that this central component of the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s arsenal, the analytic/synthetic distinction, came under\nsharp criticism from Quine in his \u201cTwo Dogmas of\nEmpiricism\u201d (1951a), less so that the criticism can only be\nsustained by relying on objections of a type first published by\nTarski. The argument is more complex, but here is a very rough sketch.\nSo as to discard the analytic/synthetic distinction as an unwarranted\ndogma, Quine in \u201cTwo Dogmas\u201d argued for the in-principle\nrevisability of all knowledge claims and criticised the impossibility\nof defining analyticity in a non-circular fashion. The first argument\ntells against the apodictic <em>a priori</em> of old (the eternal\nconceptual verities), but, as we shall see, it is unclear whether it\ntells against at least some of the notions of the <em>a priori</em>\nheld in the Vienna Circle. The second argument presupposes a\ncommitment to extensionalism that likewise can be argued not to have\nbeen shared by all in the Circle. By contrast, Tarski had merely\nobserved that, at a still more fundamental level, he knew of no basis\nfor a sharp distinction between logical and non-logical terms. (For\nrelevant primary source materials see also Quine 1935, 1951b, 1963,\nCarnap 1950, 1955, 1963b, their correspondence and related previously\nunpublished lectures and writings in Creath 1990, the memoir Quine\n1991, and Tarski 1936.)</p>", "<p>\nThe central role on the Vienna Circle\u2019s side in this discussion\nfalls to Carnap and the reorientation of philosophy he sought to\neffect in <em>Logical Syntax</em> (1934/37). It was the notion of the\nmerely relative and therefore non-apodictic <em>a priori</em> that\ndeeply conditioned his notion of analyticity and allowed him to\nsidestep Quine\u2019s fallibilist argument in a most instructive\nfashion. In doing so Carnap built on an idea behind\nReichenbach\u2019s early attempt (1920) to comprehend the general\ntheory of relativity by means of the notion of a merely constitutive\n<em>a priori</em>. Now Schlick had objected to the residual idealism\nof this proposal (see Oberdan 2009) and prefered talk of conventions\ninstead and Reichenbach soon followed him in this (see Coffa 1991, Ch.\n10). Carnap too did not speak of the relative <em>a priori</em> as\nsuch (in returning to this terminology present discussions follow\nFriedman 1994), but his pluralism of logico-linguistic frameworks\nfurnishes precisely that.</p>", "<p>\nFirst consider Schlick as a contrast class. Schlick (1934) appeared to\nshow little awareness of the language-relativity of the\nanalytic/synthetic distinction and spoke of analytic truths as\nconceptual necessities that can be conclusively surveyed. This would\nsuggest that Schlick rejected Kant\u2019s apodictic synthetic <em>a\npriori</em> but not the apodicity of analytic statements. Clearly, if\nthat were so, Quine\u2019s argument from universal fallibilism would\nfind a target here. Matters are not quite so clear-cut, however.\nSchlick had long accepted the doctrine of semantic conventionalism\nthat the same facts could be captured by different conceptual systems\n(1915): this would suggest that his analytic truths were conventions that were\nframework-relative and as such necessary only in the very frameworks\nthey helped to constitute. Yet Schlick did not countenance\nthe possibility of incommensurable conceptual frameworks:\nany fact was potentially expressible in any framework (1936b). As a\nresult, Schlick did not accept the possibility that after the adoption\nof a new framework the analytic truths of the old one may be no longer\nassertable, that they could be discarded as no longer applicable even\nin translation, as it were. Herein lay a point that Quine\u2019s\nargument could exploit: Schlick\u2019s analytic truths remained\nunassailable despite their language-relativity.</p>", "<p>\nNow Carnap, under the banner of the principle of logical tolerance\n(1934/37, \u00a717), abandoned the idea of the one universal logic\nwhich had informed Frege, Russell and Wittgenstein before him.\nInstead, he recognized a plurality of logics and languages whose\nconsistency was an objective matter even though axioms and logical\nrules were fixed entirely by convention. Already due to this logical\npluralism, the framework-relativity of analytic statements went deeper\nfor Carnap than it did for Schlick. But Carnap also accepted the\npossibility of incommensurability between seemingly similar\ndescriptive terms and between entire conceptual systems (1936a).\nAccepting the analytic truths of the framework of our best physical\ntheory may thus be incompatible with accepting those of an earlier\none, even if the same logic is employed in both. Carnapian\nanalyticities do not therefore express propositions that we hold to be\ntrue unconditionally, but only propositions true relative to their own\nframework: they are no longer held to be\npotentially translatable across all frameworks. Quine\u2019s charge of\nuniversal revisability (which itself needs some modification; see\nPutnam 1978) thus misses its mark against them. (Quine, of course, also\nrejected Carnap\u2019s ultimately intensionalist accommodation of radical\nfallibilism via the notion of language change.)</p>", "<p>\nConcerning the criticism of the circular nature of the definition of\nanalyticity, Carnap responded that it pertained primarily to the idea\nof analyticity in natural language whereas he was interested in\n\u201cexplications\u201d as provided by the logic of science (or\nbetter, a logic of science, since there existed no unique logic of\nscience for Carnap). Explications are reconstructions in a formal\nlanguage of selected aspects of complex terms that should not be\nexpected to model the original in all respects (1950b, Ch.1).\nMoreover, Carnap held that explication of the notion of analyticity in\nformal languages yielded the kind of precision that rendered the\ncomplaint of circularity irrelevant: vague intuitions of meaning were\nno longer relied upon. Those propositions of a given language were\nanalytic that followed from its axioms and, once the syntactic\nlimitations of the <em>Logical Syntax</em> period had been left\nbehind, from its definitions and meaning postulates, by application of\nits rules: no ambiguity obtained.</p>", "<p>\nSo it may appear that the notion of analyticity is easily delimitable\nin Carnap\u2019s explicational approach: analytic propositions would\nbe those that constitute a logico-linguistic framework. But\ncomplications arose from the fact that, on Carnap\u2019s\nunderstanding, not all propositions defining a logico-linguistic\nframework need be analytic ones (1934/37, \u00a751). It was possible\nfor a framework to consist not only of L-rules, whose entirety\ndetermines the notion of logical consequence, but also of P-rules,\nwhich represent presumed physical laws. So let analytic propositions\nbe those framework propositions whose negations are\nself-contradictory. Here a problem arose once the syntactic\nconstraints were dropped by Carnap after <em>Logical Syntax</em> so as\nto allow semantic reasoning and the introduction of so-called meaning\npostulates: now the class of analytic propositions was widened to\ninclude not only logical and mathematical truths but also those\nobtained by substitution of semantically equivalent expressions. How\nwas one now to explicate the idea that there can be non-analytic\nframework propositions (whose negations are not self-contradictory)?\nConsider that for opponents like Quine, responding that the negations\nof non-analytic framework propositions do not contradict meaning\npostulates, was merely to dress up a presupposed notion of meaning in\npseudo-formal garb: while it provided what looked like formal\ncriteria, Carnap\u2019s method did not leave the circle of\nintensional notions behind and so seemed to beg the question. Meaning\npostulates (Carnap 1952), after all, could only be identified by\nappearing on a list headed \u201cmeaning postulates\u201d (as Quine\nadded in reprints of 1951a).</p>", "<p>\nHere one must note that in <em>Logical Syntax</em>, Carnap also\nmodified the thesis of extensionality he had previously defended\nalongside Russell and Wittgenstein: now it merely claimed the\npossibility of purely extensional languages and no longer demanded\nthat intensional languages be reduced to them (<em>ibid.</em>,\n\u00a767). Of course, the mere claim that the language of science can\nbe extensional still proves troublesome enough, given that in such a\nlanguage a distinction between laws and accidentally true universal\npropositions cannot be drawn (the notion of a counterfactual\nconditional, needed to distinguish the former, is an intensional one).\nEven so, this opening of Carnap\u2019s towards intensionalism already\nat the height of his syntacticism\u2014to say nothing of his explicit\nintensionalism in <em>Meaning and Necessity</em> (1947)\u2014seems\nenough to thwart Quine\u2019s second complaint in \u201cTwo\nDogmas\u201d. Carnap did not share Quine\u2019s extensionalist\nagenda, so the need to break out of the circle of intensional notions\nonce these were clearly defined in his formal languages did not apply.\nThat theirs were in fact different empiricist research programmes was\ninsufficiently stressed, it would appear, by Quine and Quinean critics\nof Carnap (as noted pointedly by Stein 1992; cf. Ricketts 1982, 2003, Creath 1991, 2004,\nRichardson 1997).</p>", "<p>\nTo sustain his critique, Quine had to revive his and Tarski\u2019s\nearly doubts about Carnap\u2019s methodological apparatus and dig\neven deeper. (Tarski also shared Quine\u2019s misgivings about\nanalyticity when they discussed these issues with Carnap at Harvard;\nsee Mancosu 2005, Frost-Arnold 2013.) Their scepticism found its\ntarget in Carnap\u2019s ingenious measures in <em>Logical Syntax</em>\ntaken to preserve the thesis that mathematics is analytic from the\nravages of G\u00f6del\u2019s incompleteness theorems. G\u00f6del\nproved that every formal system strong enough to represent number\ntheory contains a formula that is true but neither itself or its\nnegation is provable in that system; such formulae\u2014known since\nas G\u00f6del sentences\u2014are provable in a still stronger system\nwhich, however, also contains a formula of its own that is true but\nnot provable in it (and neither is its negation). Commonly,\nG\u00f6del\u2019s proof is taken to have undermined the thesis of the\nanalyticity of arithmetic. (For discussions of this challenge to\nCarnap\u2019s logical syntax project, see Friedman 1988, 1999a, 2009,\nGoldfarb and Ricketts 1992, Richardson 1994, Awodey and Carus 2003,\n2004.) Carnap responded by stating that arithmetic demands an infinite\nsequence of ever richer languages and by declaring analytic statements\nto be provable by non-finite reasoning (1934/37, \u00a760a-d). This\nlooked like fitting the bill on purely technical grounds, but it is\nquestionable whether such reasoning may still count as syntactic.\nNowadays, it is computational effectiveness that is taken to\ndistinguish purely formal from non-formal, material reasoning.\n(Carnap\u2019s move highlights the tension within <em>Logical\nSyntax</em> between formal and crypto-semantic reasoning: that the rigid\nsyntacticism officially advertised there was at the same time\nundermined as its failings were being compensated\u2014illegitimately so\nby official standards, e.g., by considering translatability a\nsyntactic notion\u2014points ahead to his acceptance of semantics in 1935, only one\nyear after the publication of <em>Logical Syntax</em> and contrary to\nhis disparagement of the notion of synthetic truth there. For a discussion of Carnap\u2019s moves, see Coffa\n1978, Ricketts 1996, Goldfarb 1997, Creath 1996, 1999.) It is no\ncriticism that Carnap\u2019s reconstruction of arithmetic was not\nstandard logicism, but that Carnap unduly stretched the idea of formal\nreasoning is. Was he saved by his shift to semantics?</p>", "<p>\nTarski (1936) granted the language-relativity of the reconstructed\nnotion of analyticity in <em>Logical Syntax</em>. He also did not\nobject that Carnap\u2019s procedure of circumventing the problem\nwhich the G\u00f6del sentences presented to the thesis of the\nanalyticity of arithmetic was illegitimate. Tarski rather questioned\nwhether there were \u201cobjective reasons\u201d for the sharp\ndistinction between logical and non-logical terms and he pointed out\nthat Carnap\u2019s distinction between the logical and the empirical\nwas not a hard and fast one. Since noting that the distinction between\nlogical and non-logical was not a sharp one and arguing that no\nprincipled distinction could be upheld between them are two quite\ndifferent reactions, however, Tarski\u2019s point on its own does not\nfully support the Quinean critique. Quine\u2019s conclusion (1940,\n\u00a760) that the notion of logical truth itself is\n\u201cinformal\u201d rather reflects the moral that he drew from\nTarski\u2019s observation. It appears that what motivated him (after\na nominalistic interlude in the 1940s) to develop his naturalistic alternative to\nCarnap\u2019s conception of philosophy was his considered rejection\nof Carnap\u2019s accommodation of the thesis that arithmetic is\nanalytic to G\u00f6del\u2019s result.</p>", "<p>\nDifferent strands of Quine\u2019s criticism of the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction must thus be distinguished. While Quine\u2019s criticisms\nin \u201cTwo Dogmas\u201d on their own clearly did not undermine all\nforms of the distinction that were defended in the Vienna\nCircle\u2014Carnap\u2019s reconstructions of the notion of\nanalyticity did not express unconditionally necessary and unrevisable\npropositions\u2014they do gain in plausibility even against\nCarnap\u2019s once it is recognized that the deepest ground of\ncontestation lies elsewhere: not in the notion of analyticity widely\nunderstood but in that of logical truth narrowly understood. Read in\nthis way, Quine can be seen to argue that the notion of L-consequence\nas explication of analytic truth\u2014as opposed to P-consequence as\nnon-analytic, mere framework entailments\u2014traded not only on the\nidea of non-finitary notions of proof but also on a distinction of\nlogical from descriptive expressions that itself only proceeded on the\nbasis of a finite enumeration of the former (compare Carnap 1934/37,\n\u00a7\u00a751\u201352). (This deficit was not repaired in\nCarnap\u2019s later work either; see Awodey 2007.) What Quine\ncriticized was precisely the fact that Carnap could ground the\ndistinction between logical and non-logical terms no deeper than by\nthe enumeration of the former in a given framework: was the\ndistinction therefore not quite arbitrary? </p>", "<p>\nQuine\u2019s direct arguments against the distinction between logical\nand empirical truth (1963) have been found to beg the question against\nCarnap and his way of conceiving of philosophy (Creath 2003). This way\nof responding to Quine\u2019s objection requires us to specify still\nmore precisely just what Carnap thought he was doing when he employed\nthe distinction between analytic and synthetic propositions. To be\nsure, in (1955) he gave broadly behavioural criteria for when meaning\nascriptions could be deemed accepted in linguistic practice, but he also noted that this was not a general requirement for the\nacceptability of explicatory discourse. To repeat, explications did\nnot seek to model natural language concepts in their tension-filled\nvividness, but to make proposals for future use and to extract and\nsystematize certain aspects for constructive purposes. Thus Carnap\nclarified (1963b, \u00a732) that he regarded the distinction between\nanalytic and synthetic statements\u2014just like the distinction\nbetween descriptive or factual and prescriptive or evaluative\nstatements\u2014not as descriptive of natural language practices, but\nas a constructive tool for logico-linguistic analysis and theory\nconstruction. It is difficult to overstress the significance of this\nstance of Carnap\u2019s for the evaluation of his version of the\nphilosophical project of the Vienna Circle. Carnap\u2019s\nunderstanding of philosophy has thus been aptly described as the\n\u201cscience of possibilities\u201d (Mormann 2000). </p>", "<p>\nAs Carnap understood the analytic/synthetic distinction, it was a\ndistinction drawn by a logician to enable greater theoretical\nsystematicity in the reconstructive understanding of a given symbol\nsystem, typically a fragment of a historically developed one. That\nfully determinative objective criteria of what to regard as a logical\nand what as a non-logical term cannot be assumed to be pre-given does\nnot then in and of itself invalidate the use of that distinction by\nCarnap. On the contrary, it has been convincingly argued that Carnap\nhimself did not hold to a notion of what is a factual and what is a\nformal expression or statement that was independent of the\nspecification of the language in question (Ricketts 1994). The\nultimate ungroundedness of his basic semantic explicatory categories,\nthis suggests instead, was a fact that his own theories fully\nrecognized and consciously exploited. (Somewhat analogously, that we\ncannot define science independently of the practice of scientists of\n\u201cour culture\u201d was admitted by Neurath 1932a, Carnap 1932d\nand Hempel 1935, much to the exasperation of Zilsel 1932 and Schlick\n1935a.)</p>", "<p>\nIt remained open for Carnap then to declare his notion of analyticity\nto be only operationally defined for constructed languages and to let\nthat notion be judged entirely in terms of its utility for\nmeta-theoretical reflection. Just on that account, however, a last\nhurdle remains: finding a suitable criterion of significance for\ntheoretical terms that allows the distinction between analytic and\nsynthetic statements to be drawn in the non-observational, theoretical\nlanguages of science. (This was a problem ever since the\nnon-eliminative reducibility of disposition terms had been accepted\nand one that still held for Carnap\u2019s 1956 criterion; see section\n3.5 below). Only if that can be done, we must therefore add, can\nCarnap claim his formalist explicationist project to emerge unscathed\nfrom the criticisms of both Tarski and Quine.</p>", "<p>\nAn important related though independently pursued line of criticism\nmay be noted here. It finds its origin in Saunders Mac Lane\u2019s\nreview (1937) of Carnap\u2019s <em>Logical Syntax</em> and focusses\nless on the analytic/synthetic distinction than on Carnap\u2019s\nfailure to give a formally correct definition of logic. It challenges\nthe ambition to have accounted for the formal sciences but declines to\nembrace a naturalistic alternative. Further research along these lines\nhas suggested to some that by extending Carnap\u2019s approach and\nframework it can be linked to attempts in category theory to provide\nthe missing definition (see Awodey 2012, 2017), while a different response to Mac Lane\u2019s as well as Quine\u2019s criticisms defends Carnap\u2019s inability, frankly admitted in (1942, 57) to define logical terms as such in full generality (Creath 2017).</p>", "<p>\nNone of the above considerations should lead one to deny, however,\nthat one can find understandings of the term \u201canalytic\u201d by\nmembers of the Vienna Circle (like Schlick) that do fall victim to the\ncriticisms of Quine more easily. Nor should one discount the fact that\nCarnap\u2019s logic of science emerges as wilfully ill-equipped to\ndeal with the problems that exercise the traditional metaphysics or\nepistemologies that deal in analyticities. (Of course, unlike his\ndetractors, Carnap considered this to be a merit of his approach.)\nLastly, it must be noted that Carnap\u2019s intensionalist logic of\nscience holds out the promise of practical utility only for the price\nof a pragmatic story that remains to be told. Of what nature are the\npractical considerations and decisions that, as Carnap so freely\nconceded (1950a), are called for when choosing logico-linguistic\nframeworks? (Such conventional choices do not respond to truth or\nfalsity, but instead to whatever is taken to measure convenience.)\nThat Carnap rightly may have considered such pragmatic questions\nbeyond his own specific brief as a logician of science does not\nobviate the need for an answer to the question itself. (Carus 2007\nargues that in this broadly pragmatic dimension lies the very point of\nCarnap\u2019s explicationism.) On this issue, too, it would have been\nhelpful if there had been more collaboration with Neurath and Frank,\nwho were sympathetic to Carnap\u2019s explication of analyticity but\ndid not refer to it much in their own, more practice-oriented\ninvestigations (see section 3.6 below).</p>", "<p>\nAs it happens, anti-verificationism has two aspects: opposition to\nmeaning reductionism and opposition to the formalist project. Turning\nto the former, we must distinguish two forms of reductionism,\nphenomenalist and physicalist reductionism. Phenomenalism holds\nstatements to be cognitively significant if they can be reduced to\nstatements about one\u2019s experience, be it outer (senses) or inner\n(introspection). Physicalism holds statements to be cognitively\nsignificant if they can be reduced or evidentially related to\nstatements about physical states of affairs. Here it must be noted not\nonly that the Vienna Circle is typically remembered in terms of the\napparently phenomenalist ambitions of Carnap\u2019s <em>Aufbau</em>\nof 1928, but also that already by the early 1930s some form of\nphysicalism was favoured by some leading members including Carnap\n(1932b) and that already in the <em>Aufbau</em> the possibility of a\ndifferent basis for a conceptual genealogy than the phenomenal one actually chosen had been indicated. Thus one\nmust not only ask about the reductionism in the <em>Aufbau</em> but\nalso consider just how reductivist in intent the physicalism was meant\nto be.</p>", "<p>\nConsiderations can begin with an early critique that has given rise in\nsome quarters to a sharp distinction between Viennese logical\npositivism and German logical empiricism, with the former accused of\nreductionism and the latter praised for their anti-reductionism, a\ndistinction which falsely discounts the changing nature and variety of\nVienna Circle doctrines. Reichenbach\u2019s defense of empiricism\n(1938) turned on the replacement of the criterion of strict\nverifiability with one demanding only that the degree of probability\nof meaningful statements be determinable. This involved opposition\nalso to demands for the eliminative reduction of non-observational to\nobservational statements: both phenomenalism and reductive physicalism\nwere viewed as untenable and a correspondentist realism was advanced\nin their stead. Now it is true that of the members of the Vienna\nCircle only Feigl ever showed sympathies for scientific realism, but\nit is incorrect that all opposition to it in the Circle depended on\nthe naive semantics of early verificationism. Again, of course, some\nVienna Circle positions were liable to Reichenbach\u2019s\ncriticism.</p>", "<p>\nAnother misunderstanding to guard against is that the Vienna\nCircle\u2019s ongoing concern with \u201cfoundational issues\u201d\nand the \u201cfoundations of science\u201d does in itself betoken\nfoundationalism. (In the Vienna Circle\u2019s days, foundationalism\nhad it that the basic items of knowledge upon which all others\ndepended were independent of each other, concerned phenomenal states\nof affairs and were infallible; nowadays, foundationalists drop\nphenomenalism and infallibility.) Already the manifesto sought to make\nclear the Circle\u2019s opposition when it claimed that \u201cthe\nwork of \u2018philosophic\u2019 or \u2018foundational\u2019\ninvestigations remains important in accord with the scientific world\nconception. For the logical clarification of scientific concepts,\nstatements and methods liberates one from inhibiting prejudices.\nLogical and epistemological analysis does not wish to set barriers to\nscientific enquiry; on the contrary, analysis provides science with as\ncomplete a range of formal possibilities as is possible, from which to\nselect what best fits each empirical finding (example: non-Euclidean\ngeometries and the theory of relativity).\u201d (Carnap-Hahn-Neurath\n1929 [1973, 316]) This passage can be read as an early articulation of\nthe project of a critical-constructivist meta-theory of science that\nabjures a special authority of its own beyond that stemming from the\napplication of the methods of the empirical and formal sciences to\nscience itself, but instead remains open to what the actual practice\nof these sciences demands.</p>", "<p>\nHow then can Vienna Circle philosophy be absolved of foundationalism? As\nnoted, it is the <em>Aufbau</em> (and echoes of it in the manifesto)\nthat invites the charge of phenomenalist reductionism. To begin with,\none must distinguish between the strategy of reductionism and the\nambition of foundationalism. Concerning the <em>Aufbau</em> it has\nbeen argued that its strategy of reconstructing empirical knowledge\nfrom the position of methodological solipsism (phenomenalism without\nits ontological commitments and some of its epistemological ambitions)\nis owed not to foundationalist aims but to the ease by which this\nposition seemed to allow the demonstration of the interlocking and\nstructural nature of our system of empirical concepts, a system that\nexhibited unity and afforded objectivity, which was Carnap\u2019s\nmain concern. (See Friedman\u2019s path-breaking 1987 and 1992, and Richardson 1990, 1998, Ryckman\n1991, Pincock 2002, 2005. For the wide variety of influences on the\n<em>Aufbau</em> more generally, see Damb\u00f6ck 2016.) However, it is\nhard to deny categorically that Carnap ever harbored foundationalist\nambitions. Not only did Carnap locate his <em>Aufbau</em> very close\nto foundationalism in retrospect (1963a), but a passage in his (1930)\nled Uebel (2007, Ch.6) to claim that around 1929/30 Carnap was motivated by\nfoundationalist principles and reinterpreted his own <em>Aufbau</em>\nalong these lines (around the same time that Wittgenstein\nentertained a psychologistic reinterpretation of his own\n<em>Tractatus</em> that was reported back to the Circle by Waismann).\nTo correct this foundationalist aberration was the task of the\nCircle\u2019s subsequent protocol-sentence debate about the content,\nform and status of the evidence statements of science.</p>", "<p>\nThis concession to the foundationalist misinterpretation of Vienna\nCircle philosophies generally must not, however, be taken to tell\nagainst the new reading of the <em>Aufbau</em> or the epistemologies\ndeveloped from 1930 onwards on the physicalist wing of the Circle. In fact, the <em>Aufbau</em> itself fails when it is read as\na foundationalist project, as it was by Quine (1951a) who pointed out\nthat no eliminative definition of the relation \u2018is at\u2019 was\nprovided (required for locating objects of consciousness in physical\nspace). Yet other failures of reduction were detected by Richardson (1998, Ch.3), further questioning the <em>Aufbau\u2019s</em> supposed foundationalist intent. Ultimately it was a still different failure of reduction that prompted Carnap to abandon as\nmistaken reconstructions of the scientific language on the basis of\nmethodological solipsism (though not logical investigations of such languages for their own sake, as noted in his 1961a). Initially Carnap had not been prepared to draw this conclusion even though Neurath (1931b, 1932a) argued that such a type of\nrational reconstruction traded on objectionable\ncounterfactual presuppositions (methodological solipsism did not\nprovide a correct description of the reasoning involved in cognitive\ncommerce with the world around us). At the time Carnap\nmerely conceded that it was more \u201cconvenient\u201d to\nreconstruct the language of science on a physicalistic basis (1932e). Only the failure of reducing dispositional predicates to observational ones convinced him to abandon the methodologically solipsist approach (1936\u201337, 464 and 10) and to adopt an exclusively physicalist basis for his reconstructions of the language of science from then on (a decision explicitly reaffirmed in 1963b). \nCarnap\u2019s initial reluctance to draw this conclusion is best interpreted, not as hankering after epistemological foundations, but as indicating the growing conviction that philosophical methodology had to be built on logical reasons and should not be \u201centangled with psychological\nquestions\u201d (1934/37, \u00a772). Moreover, already Carnap\u2019s initial hope for a phenomenalist reduction in the <em>Aufbau</em> as well as his decision in (1932e) to loosen the methodologically solipsist claim on epistemology were motivated by logical considerations, the former by mistaken ideas in <em>Untersuchungen zur allgemeinen Axiomatik</em> (2000, unpublished at the time) and the latter partly as a consequence of G\u00f6del\u2019s advice on a faulty definition of analyticity in a draft of <em>Logical Syntax</em> (see Ricketts 2010 and Awodey and Carus 2007 respectively).</p>", "<p>\nIt could likewise be asked concerning physicalism whether it represented, on a different basis, the pursuit of a\nfoundationalist agenda. But that Carnap later in\n(1936/37) called his non-eliminative definitions of disposition\nterms \u201creduction sentences\u201d already indicates that it was enough\nfor him to provide a basis for the applicability of these terms by\nmerely sufficient but not necessary conditions. Likewise,\nCarnap\u2019s proposal (1939) to conceive of theoretical terms as\ndefined by implicit definition in a non-interpreted language, selected terms of which were, however, linked via non-eliminative\nreductive chain to the observational language, suggests that what concerned him\nprimarily was the capture of indicator relations to sustain in\nprinciple testability of statements containing the terms in question.\nThis is best understood as an attempt to preserve the empirical\napplicability of the formal languages constructed for high-level theory, but\nnot as reductivism with regard to some foundational given.</p>", "<p>\nBy contrast, Neurath never advocated methodological solipsism. Consider that his\ncomplex conception of the form of protocol statements (1932b)\nexplicated the concept of observational evidence in terms that\nexpressly reflected debts to empirical assumptions which called for\ntheoretical elaboration in turn. For unlike the logician of science\nCarnap, who left it to psychology and brain science to determine more\nprecisely what the class observational predicates were that could\nfeature in protocol statements (1936/37), the empirically oriented\nmeta-theoretician of science Neurath was concerned to encompass and\ncomprehend the practical complexities of reliance on scientific\ntestimony: the different clauses (embeddings) of his proposed protocol\nstatements stand for conditions on the acceptance of such testimony\n(see Uebel 2009). In addition, Neurath\u2019s theory of protocol\nstatements also makes clear that his understanding of physicalism did\nnot entail the eliminative reduction of the phenomenon of\nintentionality but, like Carnap (1932c), merely sought its integration\ninto empiricist discourse.</p>", "<p>\nGiven these different emphases of their respective physicalisms,\nmention must also be made of the significant differences between\nCarnap\u2019s and Neurath\u2019s conceptions of unified science:\nwhere the formalist Carnap once preferred a hierarchical ordering of\nfinitely axiomatized theoretical languages that allowed at least\npartial cross-language definitions and derivations\u2014these\nrequirements were liberalized over the years (1936b), (1938),\n(1939)\u2014the pragmatist Neurath opted from the start to demand\nonly the interconnectability of predictions made in the different\nindividual sciences (1935a), (1936c), (1944). (Metereology, botany and\nsociology must be combinable to predict the consequences of a forest\nfire, say, even though each may have its own autonomous theoretical\nvocabulary.) Here too it must be remembered that, unlike Carnap,\nNeurath only rarely addressed issues in the formal logic of science\nbut mainly concerned himself with the partly contextually fixed\npragmatics of science. (One exception is his 1935b, a coda to his\nprevious contributions to the socialist calculation debate with Ludwig\nvon Mises and others.) Not surprisingly, at times the priorities set\nby Neurath for the pragmatics of science seemed to conflict with those\nof Carnap\u2019s logic of science. (These tensions often were\npalpable in the grand publication project undertaken by Carnap and\nNeurath in conjunction with Morris, the International Encyclopedia of\nthe Unity of Science; see Reisch 2003.) That said, however, note that\nCarnap\u2019s more hierarchical approach to the unity of science also\ndoes not support the attribution of foundationalist ambitions.</p>", "<p>\nBut for a brief lapse around 1929/30 and perhaps in some pre-Vienna years, then,\nCarnap fully represents the position of Vienna Circle\nanti-foundationalism. In this he joined Neurath whose long-standing\nanti-foundationalism is evident from his famous simile, first used in\n1913, that likens scientists to sailors who have to repair their boat\nwithout ever being able to pull into dry dock (1932b). Their positions\ncontrasted at least <em>prima facie</em> with that of Schlick (1934)\nwho explicitly defended the idea of foundations in the Circle\u2019s\nprotocol-sentence debate. Even Schlick conceded, however, that all\nscientific statements were fallible ones, so his position on\nfoundationalism was by no means the traditional one. The point of his\n\u201cfoundations\u201d remained less than wholly clear and\ndifferent interpretation of it have been put forward (e.g., Oberdan 1998, Uebel 1996, 2020). (On the protocol\nsentence debate as a whole, which included not only the debate between\nCarnap and Neurath but also debates between the physicalists and Schlick and other occasional participants,\nsee, e.g., the differently centered accounts of Uebel 1992, 2007,\nOberdan 1993, Cirera 1994.) While all in the Circle thus recognized as\nfutile the attempt to restore certainty to scientific knowledge\nclaims, not all members embraced positions that rejected\nfoundationalism <em>tout court</em>. Clearly, however, attributing\nfoundationalist ambitions to the Circle as a whole constitutes a total\nmisunderstanding of its internal dynamics and historical development,\nif it does not bespeak wilfull ignorance. At most, a foundationalist\nfaction around Schlick can be distinguished from the so-called left\nwing whose members pioneered anti-foundationalism with regard to both\nthe empirical and formal sciences.</p>", "<p>\nYet even if it be conceded that the members of the Vienna Circle did\nnot harbour undue reductionist-foundationalist ambitions, the question\nremains open whether they were able to deal with the complexities of\nscientific theory building.</p>", "<p>\nHere the prominent role of Schlick must be mentioned, whose\n<em>General Theory of Knowledge</em> (1918, second edition 1925) was\none of the first publications by (future) members of the Vienna Circle\nto introduce the so-called two-languages model of scientific theories.\nAccording to this model, scientific theories comprised an\nobservational part formulated with observational predicates as\ncustomarily interpreted, in which observations and experiential laws\nwere stated, and a theoretical part which consisted of theoretical\nlaws the terms of which were merely implicitly defined, namely, in\nterms of the roles they played in the laws in which they figured. Both\nparts were connected in virtue of a correlation that could be\nestablished between selected terms of the theoretical part and\nobservational terms. In the second half of the 1920s, however,\nSchlick\u2019s model, involving separate conceptual systems, was put\naside in favor of a more streamlined conception of scientific theories\nalong lines as suggested by the <em>Aufbau</em>. Clearly, however,\nSchlick\u2019s model represents an early form of the conception of\nscientific theories as uninterpreted calculi connected to observation\nby potentially complicated correspondence rules that Carnap\nreintroduced in (1939) and that became standard in the \u201creceived\nview\u201d. (Another, albeit faint precursor was the idea contained\nin a 1910 remark of Frank\u2019s pointing out the applicability of\nHilbert\u2019s method of implicit definition to the reconstruction\nempirical scientific theories as conceived, also along the lines of\ntwo distinct languages, by the French conventionalists Rey and Duhem;\nsee Uebel 2003.)</p>", "<p>\nEven granted the model in outline, questions arise both concerning its\nobservational base as well as its theoretical superstructure. We\nalready discussed one aspect of the former topic, the issue of\nprotocols, in the previous section; let\u2019s here turn to the\nlatter topic. Talk of correspondence rules only masks the problem that\nis raised by theoretical terms. One of the pressing issues concerns\ntheir so-called surplus meaning over and above their observational\nconsequences. This issue is closely related to the problem of\nscientific realism: are there truth-evaluatable matters of fact for\nscientific theories beyond their empirical, observational adequacy?\nEven though the moniker \u201cneo-positivism\u201d would seem to\nprescribe an easy answer as to what the Vienna Circle\u2019s position\nwas, it must be noted that just as there is no consensus discernible\ntoday there was none in the Circle beyond certain basics that left the\nmatter undecided.</p>", "<p>\nAll in the Vienna Circle followed Carnap\u2019s judgement in\n<em>Pseudoproblems of Philosophy</em> (1928b) and Schlick\u2019s\ncontention in his response to Planck\u2019s renewal of anti-Machian\npolemics (1932) that questions like that of the reality of the\nexternal world were not well-formed ones but only constituted\npseudo-questions. While this left the observables of empirical reality\nclearly in place, theoretical entities remained problematical: were\nthey really only computational fictions introduced for the ease with\nwhich they they allowed complex predictive reasoning, as Frank (1932)\nheld? This hardly seems to do justice to the surplus meaning of\ntheoretical terms over and above their computational utility: theories\nemploying them seem to tell us about non-observable features of the\nworld. This indeed was Feigl\u2019s complaint (1950) in what must\ncount as the first of very few forays into \u201csemantical\nrealism\u201d (scientific realism by another word) by a former member\nof the Vienna Circle\u2014and one that was quickly opposed by\nFrank\u2019s instrumentalist rejoinder (1950). Carnap sought to remain\naloof on this as on other ontological questions. So while in the\nheyday of the Vienna Circle itself the issue had not yet come into\nclear focus, by mid-century one could distinguish amongst its\nsurviving members both realists (Feigl) and anti-realists (Frank) as\nwell as ontological deflationists (Carnap).</p>", "<p>\nCarnap\u2019s general recipe for avoiding undue commitments (while\npursuing his investigations of various language forms, including the\nintensional ones Quine frowned upon) was given in terms of the\ndistinction between so-called internal and external questions (1950a).\nGiven the adoption of a logico-linguistic framework, we can state the\nfacts in accordance with what that framework allows us to say. Given\nany of the languages of arithmetic, say, we can state as arithmetical\nfact whatever we can prove in them; to say that there are\nnumbers, however, is at best to express the fact that numbers are a\nbasic category of that framework (irrespective of whether they are\nlogically derived from a still more basic category). As to whether\ncertain special types of numbers exist (in the deflated sense), that\ndepends on the expressive power of the framework at hand and on\nwhether the relevant facts can be proven. Analogous considerations\napply to the existence of physical things (the external world) given\nthe logico-linguistic frameworks of everyday discourse and empirical\nscience. (The near-tautologous nature of these categorical claims in\nCarnap\u2019s hands echoes his earlier diagnosis of metaphysical\nclaims as pseudo-statements; see also 1934/37, Part V.A.) Unlike such\ninternal questions, however, external questions, questions whether\nnumbers or electrons \u201creally exist\u201d irrespective of any\nframework, are ruled out as illegitimate and meaningless. The only way\nin which sense could be given to them was to read them as pragmatic\nquestions concerned with the utility of talk about numbers or\nelectrons, of adopting certain frameworks. Carnap clearly retained his\nbasic position: existence claims remain the\nprovince of science and there must be seen as mediated by the\navailable conceptual tools of inquiry. Logicians of science are in no\nposition to double-guess the scientists in their own proper\ndomain. (Needless to say, Quine 1951b opposed the internal/external distinction as much as his 1951a opposed the analytic/synthetic distinction.)</p>", "<p>\nMatters came to a head with the discovery of a proof (see Craig 1956)\nthat the theoretical terms of a scientific theory are dispensable in\nthe sense of it being possible to devise a functionally equivalent\ntheory that does not make use of them. Did this not rob theoretical\nterms of their distinctive role and so support instrumentalism? The\nnegative answer was twofold. As regards defending their utility,\nCarnap (1963b, \u00a724) agreed with Hempel (1958) that in practice\ntheoretical terms were indispensible in facilitating inductive\nrelations between observational data. As regards the defense of their\ncognitive legitimacy, Carnap held that this demanded determining what\nhe called their \u201cexperiential import\u201d, namely, determining\nwhat specifically their empirical significance consisted in. It was\nfor this purpose that Carnap came to employ Ramsey\u2019s method of\nregimenting theoretical terms. Nowadays this so-called ramseyfication\nis often discussed as a means for expressing a position of\n\u201cstructural realism\u201d, a position midway between\nfully-blown scientific realism and anti-realism and so sometimes\nthought to be of interest to Carnap. Carnap\u2019s own concern with\nramseyfication throws into relief not only the question of the\nviability of one of the Vienna Circle\u2019s most forward-looking\nstances in the debate about theoretical terms\u2014intending to avoid\nboth realism and anti-realism\u2014but also several other issues that\nbear on the question of which, if any, forms of Vienna Circle\nphilosophy remain viable.</p>", "<p>\nNote that the issue of realism vis-\u00e0-vis theoretical terms is\nclosely related to two other issues central to the development of\nVienna Circle philosophy: Carnap\u2019s further attempts to develop a\ncriterion of empiricist significance for the terms of the theoretical\nlanguages of science and his attempts to defend the distinction\nbetween synthetic and analytic statements with regard to such\ntheoretical languages.</p>", "<p>\nIn 1956 Carnap introduced a new criterion of significance specifically\nfor theoretical terms (1956b). This criterion was explicitly\ntheory-relative. Roughly, Carnap first defined the concept of the\n\u201crelative significance\u201d of a theoretical term. A term is\nrelatively significant if and only if there exists a statement in the\ntheoretical language that contains it as the only non-logical term and\nfrom which, in conjunction with another theoretical statement and the\nsets of theoretical postulates and correspondence rules, an\nobservational statement is derivable that is not derivable from that\nother theoretical statement and the sets of theoretical postulates and\ncorrespondence rules alone. Then Carnap defined the\n\u201csignificance\u201d of a theoretical term in terms of it\nbelonging to a sequence of such terms such that each is relatively\nsignificant to the class of those terms that precede it in the\nsequence. Now those theoretical statements were legitimate and\ncognitively significant that were well-formed and whose descriptive\nconstants were significant the sense just specified. It is clear that\nby the stepwise introduction of theoretical terms as specified, Carnap\nsought to avoid the deleterious situations that rendered Ayer\u2019s\ncriterion false (and his own of 1928). Nevertheless, this proposal too\nwas subjected to criticism (e.g., Rozeboom 1960, Kaplan 1975a). A\ncommon impression amongst philosophers appears to be that this\ncriterion failed as well, but this judgement is by no means\nuniversally shared (for the majority view see Glymour 1980, for a\ncontrary assessment see Sarkar 2001). Thus it has been argued that\nsubject to some further refinements, Carnap\u2019s proposal can be\nmade to work (see for discussion Creath 1976, Justus 2014, Lutz 2017)\u2014as long as the sharp\ndistinction between observational and theoretical terms can be\nsustained. (In light of the objections to the latter distinction one\nwants to add: or by a dichotomy of terms functionally equivalent to\nit.)</p>", "<p>\nCarnap\u2019s own position on his 1956 criterion appears somewhat\nambiguous. While he is reported to have accepted one set of criticisms\n(Kaplan 1975b), he also asserted even after they had been put to him\nthat he thought his 1956 criterion remained adequate (1963b,\n\u00a724b). Yet Carnap there also advised investigation of\nwhether still another, then entirely new approach to theoretical terms\nthat he was developing would allow for an improved criterion of significance\nfor them. So when Carnap offered \u201cthe Ramsey method\u201d as a\nmethod of characterizing the \u201cempirical meaning of theoretical\nterms\u201d it was not their empirical significance as such but the\nspecific empirical import of theoretical terms that he considered\n(1966, Ch. 26). What prompted him to undertake his investigations of\nramseyfications was not dissatisfaction with his 1956 proposal as a\ncriterion of significance for theoretical terms, but the fact that it still proved\nimpossible with this model to draw the distinction between synthetic and analytic\nstatements in the theoretical language. The reason for this was that\nthe postulates for the theoretical language also specify factual\nrelations between phenomena that fall under the concepts that are\nimplicitly defined by them. (As noted, a similar problem already had\nplagued Carnap\u2019s analyses of disposition terms ever since he\nallowed for non-eliminative reduction chains.)</p>", "<p>\nCarnap\u2019s attempt to address this problem by ramseyfication was\npublished in several places from 1958 onwards. (See Carnap 1958, 1963,\n\u00a724C-D and the popular exposition 1966, Chs. 26 and 28; compare\nRamsey 1929 and see Psillos 1999, Ch.3. This proposal and a variant of\nit (1961b) were both presented in his 1959 Santa Barbara lecture\n(published in Psillos 2000a); as it happened, Kaplan presented his\ncriticism (1975a) of Carnap\u2019s 1956 criterion at the same\nconference.) With ramseyfication Carnap adverted again to entire\ntheories as the unit of assessment. Ramseyfication consists in the\nreplacement of the theoretical terms of a finitely axiomatized theory\nby bound higher-order variables. This involves combining all the\ntheoretical postulates which define theoretical terms (call this\nconjunction <em>T</em>) and correspondence rules of a theory which\nlink some of these theoretical terms with observational ones (call\nthis <em>C</em>) in one long sentence (call this <em>TC</em>) and then\nreplacing all the theoretical predicates that occur in it by bound\nhigher-order variables (call this <em><sup>R</sup>TC</em>). This is\nthe so-called Ramsey-sentence of the entire theory; in it no\ntheoretical terms appear, but it possesses the same explanatory and\npredictive power as the original theory: it has the same observational\nconsequences. However, Carnap stressed that the Ramsey sentence cannot\nbe said to be expressed in a \u201csimple\u201d but only an\n\u201cextended\u201d observational language, for due to its\nhigher-order quantificational apparatus it includes \u201can advanced\ncomplicated logic embracing virtually the whole of mathematics\u201d\n(1966, [1996, 253]).</p>", "<p>\nTo distinguish between analytic and synthetic statements in the\ntheoretical language Carnap made the following proposal. Let the\nRamsey sentence of the conjunction of all theoretical postulates and\nthe conjunction of all correspondence rules of that theory be\nconsidered as expressing the entire factual, synthetic content of the\nscientific theory and its terms in their entirety. By contrast, the\nstatement \u201c<em><sup>R</sup>TC</em> \u2192 <em>TC</em>\u201d\nexpressed the purely analytic component of the theory, its\n\u201cA-postulate\u201d (or so-called Carnap sentence). This\n\u201cA-postulate states that if entities exist (referred to by the\nexistential quantifiers of the Ramsey sentence) that are of a kind\nbound together by all the relations expressed in the theoretical\npostulates of the theory and that are related to observational\nentities by all the relations specified by the correspondence\npostulates of the theory, then the theory itself is true.\u201d Or\ndifferently put, the A-postulate \u201csays only that if the world is\nthis way, then the theoretical terms must be understood as satisfying\nthe theory\u201d (1966 [1996, 271]). With <em><sup>R</sup>TC</em>\n\u2192 <em>TC</em> expressing a meaning postulate Carnap\nclaimed to have separated the analytic and synthetic components of a\nscientific theory.</p>", "<p>\nCarnap\u2019s adoption of the Ramsey method met mainly with criticism\n(Psillos 1999, ch.3, 2000b, Demopoulos 2003, 2017), even though\nramseyfications continue to be discussed as a method of characterizing\ntheoretical terms in a realist vein (albeit with conditions not yet\nintroduced by Carnap, as in Lewis 1970, Papineau 1996). With\nCarnap\u2019s ramseyfications, however, we do not get the answer that what exists is the structure that the ramseyfication at hand\nidentifies. Given the absence of a clause requiring unique\nrealizability, ramseyfications counseled modesty: the structure that\nis identified remains indeterminate to just that degree to which\ntheoretical terms remain incompletely interpreted (Carnap 1961b). To\nthis we must add that for Carnap ramseyfications of theoretical terms\ncan support only internal existence claims: he explicitly reaffirmed\nhis confidence in the distinction between internal and external\nquestion to defuse the realism/anti-realism issue (1966 [1996, 256]).\nThis strongly suggests that with these proposals Carnap did not intend\nto deviate from his deflationist approach to ontology.</p>", "<p>\nWhat must be considered, however, is that Carnap\u2019s proposal to\nreconstruct the contribution of theoretical terms by ramseyfication\nfalls foul of arguments deriving from M.H.A. Newman\u2019s objection\nto Russell\u2019s structuralism in <em>Analysis of Matter</em> (see\nDemopoulos and Friedman 1985). This objection says that once they are\nempirically adequate, ramseyfied theories are trivially true, given\nthe nature of their reconstruction of original theories. Russell held\nthat \u201cnothing but the structure of the external world is\nknown\u201d. But if nothing is known about the generating relation\nthat produces the structure, then the claim that there exists such a\nstructure is vacuous, Newman claimed. \u201cAny collection of things\ncan be organised so as to have the structure <em>W</em>, provided\nthere are the right number of them.\u201d (Newman 1928, 144) To see\nhow this so-called cardinality constraint applies to ramseyfications\nof theories, note that in Carnap\u2019s hands, the non-observational\npart of reconstructed theories, their theoretical entities, were\nrepresented by \u201cpurely logico-mathematical entities, e.g.\nnatural numbers, classes of such, classes of classes, etc.\u201d For\nhim the Ramsey sentence asserted that \u201cobservable events in the\nworld are such that there are numbers, classes of such, etc., which\nare correlated with events in a prescribed way and which have among\nthemselves certain relations\u201d, this being \u201cclearly a\nfactual statement about the world\u201d (Carnap 1963b, 963). Carnap\nhere had mathematical physics in mind where space-time points are\nrepresented by quadruples of real numbers and physical properties like\nelectrical charge-density or mass-density are represented as functions\nof such quadruples of real numbers.</p>", "<p>\nThe problem that arises from this for Carnap is not the\nfailure to single out the intended interpretation of the theory: as\nnoted, Carnap clearly thought it an advantage of the method that it\nremained suitably indeterminate. The problem for Carnap is rather\nthat, subject to its empirical adequacy, the truth conditions of the\nRamsey-sentences are fulfilled trivially on logico-mathematical\ngrounds alone. As he stated, Ramsey-sentences demand that there be a\nstructure of entities that is correlated with observable events in the\nway described. Yet given the amount of mathematics that went into the\nramseyfied theory\u2014\u201cvirtually the whole of\nmathematics\u201d\u2014some such structure as demanded by the\nRamsey-sentence is bound to be found among those entities presupposed\nby its representational apparatus. (Here the cardinality constraint is no\nconstraint at all.) That any theory is trivially true for purely\nformal reasons (as long as it is empirically adequate) therefore is held against\nCarnap\u2019s proposal to use Ramsey sentences as reconstructions of\nthe synthetic content of the theoretical part of empirical scientific\ntheories. Given that with ramseyfications \u201cthe truth of physical\ntheory reduces to the truth of its observational consequences\u201d\n(Demopoulos and Friedman 1985, 635), this is a problem for\nCarnap\u2019s project on its own terms: any surplus empirical meaning\nof theoretical terms that Carnap sought to capture simply evaporates\n(Demopoulos 2003).</p>", "<p>\nThis result casts its shadow over Carnap\u2019s last treatment of\ntheoretical terms in its entirety and threatens further consequences.\nIf the reconstruction of empirical theories by ramseyfication in\nCarnap\u2019s fashion is unacceptable, then all explications that\nbuild on this are called into question: explications of theoretical\nanalyticity as much as explications of the experiential import of\ntheories. If no justice has been done to the experiential\nimport of theoretical terms, then one must ask whether\nthe analytic components of a theoretical language have been correctly\nidentified. If they have not, then the meta-theoretical utility of the\nsynthetic/analytic distinction is once again be called into\nquestion.</p>", "<p>\nOne is lead to wonder whether Carnap would not be well advised to\nreturn to his 1956 position. This allowed for a criterion of empirical\nsignificance for theoretical terms but not for the analytic/synthetic\ndistinction to be sustained with regard to the theoretical language.\nAccording to Carnap\u2019s fall-back position before he hit upon\nramseyfication, it was thought possible to distinguish narrow logical\ntruth from factual truth in the theoretical language (1966, Ch. 28).\nYet it is difficult to silence the suspicion that an\nanalytic/synthetic distinction that applies only to observational\nlanguages\u2014and admits inescapable semantical holism for\ntheoretical languages\u2014is not what the debate between Carnap and\nQuine was all about. Attempts have thus been undertaken\nto provide interpretations of Carnap\u2019s\nramseyfications that contain or mitigate the effects of the Newman\nobjection (Friedman 2008, 2011, Uebel 2011b, Creath 2012). What has become clear, in any case,\nis that much is at stake for Carnap\u2019s formal explicationism,\nindeed for the standard logical empiricist model of scientific\ntheories (see below).</p>", "<p>\nWe are now in a position to return to a final criticism of the search\nfor a criterion of empiricist significance. Much has been made of the\nvery status of the criterion itself (however it may be put in the\nend): was it empirically testable? It is common to claim that it is\nnot and therefore to consign it to insignificance in turn, following\nPutnam (1981a, 1981b). The question arises whether this is to overlook the fact \nthat the criterion of significance was put forward not as an empirical\nclaim but as a meta-theoretical proposal for how to delimit empiricist\nlanguages from non-empiricist ones. Again, pursuing this line of\ninquiry is not to deny that the meaning\ncriterion may have been understood by some members of the Circle in such a way that it became liable\nto charges of self-refutation. Even if that were the case, the reason\nfor this may be found not in the very idea of such a criterion, but\nin the contradictory status of the Tractarian \u201celucidations\u201d to which\nthe criterion was likened. (The legitimacy of these elucidations was\nat issue already in the debates that divided the Circle in the early\n1930s; see, e.g., Neurath 1932a.) What will be considered here is primarily the view of Carnap, who from 1932 onwards put his\nphilosophical theses in the form of \u201cproposals\u201d for\nalternative language forms, but how the pragmatist alternative fares\nwill also be considered. Finally, we will consider where this does\nleave neopositivist anti-metaphysics.</p>", "<p>\nFor Carnap, the empiricist criterion of significance was an analytic\nprinciple, but in a very special sense. As a convention, the criterion\nhad the standing of an analytic statement, but it was not a formally\nspecifiable framework principle of the language <em>L<sub>n</sub></em>\nto which it pertained. Properly formulated, it was a semantic\nprinciple concerning <em>L<sub>n</sub></em> that was statable only in\nits meta-language <em>L</em><sub><em>n</em>+1</sub>. To argue that the\ncriterion itself is meaningless because it has no standing in\n<em>L<sub>n</sub></em> is to commit a category mistake, for\nmeta-linguistic assertions need not have counterparts in their object\nlanguages (Goldfarb 1997, Creath 2004, Richardson 2004). Nor would it\nbe correct to claim that the criterion hides circular reasoning,\nallegedly because its rejection of the meaningless depends on an\nunquestioned notion of experiential fact as self-explanatory (when\nsuch fact is still to be constituted). Importantly, Carnap\u2019s\nlanguage constructor does not start with fixed notions of what is\nempirical (rather than formal) or what is given (rather than assumed\nor inferred), but from the beginning allows a plurality of\nperspectives on these distinctions (Ricketts 1994). Carnap\u2019s\nempiricist criterion of significance is precisely this: an\nexplication, a proposal for how empiricists may wish to speak. It is\nnot an explanation of how meaning arises from what is not meaningful\nin itself. Unlike theorists who wish to explain how meaning itself is\nconstituted, explicationists can remain untroubled by the regress of\nformal semantics with Tarskian strictures. For them, the lack of\nformal closure (the incompleteness of arithmetic and the\ninapplicability of the truth predicate to its own language) only\nbetokens the fact that our very own home languages cannot ever be\nfully explicated.</p>", "<p>\nIt may be wondered whether such considerations have not become\npointless, given the troubles that attempts to provide a criterion of\nsignificance ran into. However, as we saw, Carnap\u2019s 1956\ncriterion for constructed languages remains in play. Moreover, there\nalso remains the informal, pragmatic approach that can be applied even\nmore widely. Thus it is not without importance to see that pragmatic\nprinciples delineating empirical significance (like Mach\u2019s or\nQuine\u2019s Peircean insight) are not ruled out from the start\neither. The reason for this is different however. For pragmatists, the\nanti-metaphysical demarcation criterion is not strictly speaking a\nmeaning criterion. The pragmatic criterion of significance is\nexpressly epistemic, not semantic: it speaks of relevance with regard\nto an established cognitive practice, not in-principle\ntruth-evaluability. This criterion is most easily expressed as a\nconditional norm, alongside other methodological maxims. (If you want\nyour reasoning to be responsible to evidence, then avoid statements\nthat experience can neither confirm or disconfirm, however\nindirectly.) So the suggestion that the criterion of empirical\nsignificance can be regarded as a proposal for how to treat the\nlanguage of science cannot be brushed aside but for the persistent\nneglect of the philosophical projects of Carnap or the non-formalist\nleft Vienna Circle.</p>", "<p>\nStill, some readers may wonder whether in the course of responding to\nthe various counter-criticisms, the Vienna Circle\u2019s position has\nnot shifted considerably. This indeed is true: the attempt to show\nmetaphysics strictly meaningless once and for all did not succeed. For\neven if Carnap\u2019s 1956 criterion and the pragmatic approach work,\nthey do not achieve that: Carnap\u2019s criterion only works for\nconstructed languages and the pragmatic one does not address the\nsemantic issue and only works case by case. But it can be argued that\nwhile this debilitates the Vienna Circle\u2019s most notorious claim\n(if understood without qualifications), it does not debilitate their\nentire program. That was, we recall, to defend Enlightenment reason\nand to counter the abuse of possibly empty but certainly\nill-understood deep-sounding language in science and in public life.\nTheir program was, to put it somewhat anachronistically, to promote\nepistemic empowerment. This program would have been helped by an\nacross-the-board criterion to show metaphysics meaningless, but it can\nalso proceed in its absence.</p>", "<p>\nBut now the suspicion may be that if all that is meant to be excluded\nis speculative reason without due regard to empirical and\nlogico-linguistic evidence, the program\u2019s success appears too\neasy. Few contemporary philosophers would confess to such reckless\npractices. Still, even the rejection of speculative reason is by no\nmeans uncontroversial, as shown by the unresolved status of the appeal\nto intuitions that characterizes much of contemporary analytical\nmetaphysics and epistemology. Moreover, much depends on what\u2019s\nconsidered to be \u201cdue regard\u201d: is merely bad science\n\u201cmetaphysics\u201d? Or only appeals to the supernatural? And\nwhat about <em>de re</em> necessities? Or the seeming commitments of\nexistential quantification? The promotion of anti-metaphysics may be\napplauded in principle as an exercise in intellectual hygiene, the\nobjection goes, but in practice it excludes either too much or too\nlittle: it either cripples our understanding of theoretical science or\nnormalizes away the Vienna Circle\u2019s most notorious claim.</p>", "<p>\nIn response it is helpful to consider the conception of metaphysics\nthat can be seen to be motivating much of the Circle\u2019s ethical\nnon-cognitivism. What did Carnap (1935) and Neurath (1932a) dismiss\nwhen they dismissed normative ethics as metaphysical and cognitively\nmeaningless? One may concede that due to the brusque way in which they\nput their broadly Humean point, they opened themselves up to\nsignificant criticism, but it is very important to see also what they\ndid not do. Most notably, they did not dismiss as meaningless all\nconcern with how to live. Conditional prescriptions remained\nstraight-forwardly truth-evaluable in instrumental terms and so\ncognitively meaningful. In addition, their own active engagement for\nEnlightenment values in public life showed that they took these\nmatters very seriously themselves. (In fact, their engagement as\npublic intellectuals compares strikingly with that of most\ncontemporary philosophers of science.) But neither did they fall\nvictim to the naturalistic fallacy nor were they simply inconsistent.\nIn the determination of basic values they rather saw acts of personal\nself-definition, but, characteristically, Carnap showed a more\nindividualistic and Neurath a more collectively oriented approach to the\nmatter. What needs to be borne in mind, then, is the meaning that they\nattached to the epithet \u201cmetaphysical\u201d in this and other\nareas: the arrogation of unique and fully determined objective insight\ninto matters beyond scientific reason. It was in the ambition of\nproviding such unconditional prescriptions that they saw philosophical\nethics being the heir of theology. (Compare Carnap 1935 and 1963b,\n\u00a732 and Neurath 1932a and 1944, \u00a719.) Needless to say, it\nremains contentious to claim those types of philosophical ethics to be\ncognitively meaningless that seek to derive determinate sets of codes\nfrom some indisputable principle or other. But the ongoing discussion\nof non-cognitivism and its persistent defense in analytical ethics as \u201cexpressivism\u201d\nsuggest that, understood as outlined, the Circle\u2019s\nnon-cognitivism was by no means absurd or contradictory.</p>", "<p>\nIt may be noted here that a newly discovered fragment of\nCarnap\u2019s writing (2017) has given fresh impetus to explorations\nof the model of ethical reasoning in terms of optatives that Carnap\noutlined (1963b, \u00a732) in response to A. Kaplan\u2019s criticism\n(1963) of his earlier position. What emerges is that Carnap was\nprepared to integrate ethical desiderata among non-ethical ones within\nthe network of means and ends that decision theory as a normative\ntheory of rational action seeks to systematize and regiment. Moral\nreasoning is assimilated to practical reasoning and no longer suffers\nfrom a deficit of significance\u2014albeit at the cost of not being\nable to exclude appeals to certain types of intrinsic value on the ground their being beyond the pale (see Carus 2017). Carnap\nmay reasonably respond here that as a theorist of science he is not\nrequired to account for normative ethics beyond providing a framework\nfor understanding its undeniable role in a generic theory of human\nbehavior. What was rightly objected against his earlier position was\nthat it made such understanding impossible.</p>", "<p>\nWhatever the details, their non-cognitivism supports the idea that the\nleft wing\u2019s anti-metaphysics was primarily deflationist. They opposed all claims to have a categorically deeper\ninsight into reality than either empirical or formal science, such\nthat philosophy would stand in judgement of these sciences as to their\nreality content or that mere science would stand in need of\nphilosophical interpretations. (Concerned with practical problems,\nthey likewise opposed philosophical claims to stand above the\ncontestations of mere mortals.) Importantly, such deflationism need\nnot remain general and vague, but can be given precise content. For\ninstance, it has been argued (Carus 1999) that Carnap was correct to understand Tarski\u2019s theory of truth not as a traditional\ncorrespondence theory such that truth consisted in some kind of\nagreement of statements or judgements and facts or the world where the\nlatter make true the former. In Carnap\u2019s unchanged opposition to\nthe classical correspondence theory of truth in turn lies not only the\ncontinuity between his own syntactic and semantic phases, but also the\nkey to his and the entire left Vienna Circle\u2019s understanding of\ntheir anti-metaphysical campaign. (On various occasions in the early\n30s, Hahn, Frank and Neurath opposed correspondence truth very\nexplicitly, while, in later years, Neurath resisted Tarskian semantics\nprecisely because he wrongly suspected it of resurrecting\ncorrespondentism and Frank continued to castigate correspondentism\nwhenever required. On this tangled issue, see Mormann 1999, Uebel\n2004, Mancosu 2008.)</p>", "<p>\nThis suggests that a hard core of Viennese anti-metaphysics survives\nthe criticism and subsequent qualifications of early claims made for\ntheir criteria of empirical significance, yet retains sufficient\nphilosophical teeth to remain of contemporary interest. The\nmetaphysics which the left wing attacked, besides everyday\nsupernaturalism and the supra-scientific essentialism of old, was the\ncorrespondence conception of truth and associated realist conceptions\nof knowledge. These notions were deemed attackable directly on\nepistemological grounds, without any diversion through the theory of\nmeaning: how could such correspondences or likenesses ever be\nestablished? As Neurath liked to put it (1930), we cannot step outside\nof our thinking to see whether a correspondence obtains between what\nwe think and how the world is. (Against defenses of the correspondence\ntheory by arguments from analogy it would be argued that the\nanalogy is overextended.) Against the counter that this is merely an\nepistemic argument that does not touch the ontological issue Neurath\nis likely to have argued that doing without an epistemic account is a\nrecipe for uncontrollable metaphysics.</p>", "<p>\nImportantly, the left wing\u2019s deflationary anti-metaphysics was\naccompanied by a distinctively constructivist attitude. Here one must\nhasten to add, of course, that what was constructed were not the\nobjects of first-order discourse (tables, chairs, electrons and black\nholes) but concepts, be they concepts associated with technical terms for observables, theoretical terms or terms needed for reflection\nabout the cognitive enterprise of science (ideas like evidence and its\ndegrees and presuppositions). As meta-theorists of science they\ndeveloped explications: different types of explications were\nenvisaged, ranging from analytic definitions giving necessary and\nsufficient conditions in formal languages all the way to pragmatic,\nexemplar-based criterial delimitations of the central applications of\ncontested concepts or practices. Two branches of the Circle\u2019s\nconstructivist tendency can thus be distinguished: Carnap\u2019s\nrational reconstructions and formalist explications and\nNeurath\u2019s and Frank\u2019s empirically informed and\npractice-oriented reconceptualizations. The difference between these\ntwo approaches can be understood as a division\nof labor between the tasks of exploring logico-linguistic\npossibilities of conceptual reconstruction and considering the\nefficacy of particular scientific practices. In principle, the\nconstructivist tendency in Vienna Circle philosophy was able to\nembrace both (compare Carnap 1934/37, \u00a772 and Neurath 1936b).\nHowever, in its own day, this two-track approach remained\nincompletely realized as philosophical relations between Carnap and\nNeurath soured over disputes stemming from mutual misunderstandings.\nFrank\u2019s final paper (1963) was a terse reminder that the logic\nof science was not the sole successor or replacement of traditional\nphilosophy and Carnap\u2019s response (1963b, \u00a73) again acknowledged the compatibility in principle of his logic of science and what Frank called the \u201cpragmatics of science\u201d (1957). </p>", "<p>\nConsidering the Vienna Circle as a whole in the light of this reading\nof its anti-metaphysical philosophy, we find the most striking\ndivision within it yet. Unlike Carnap and the left wing, Schlick had\nlittle problem with a correspondence theory of truth once it was\ncleansed of psychologistic and intuitive accretions and centered on\nthe idea of unique coordination of statement and fact. In this lay the\nstrongest sense of continuity between his pre-Vienna Circle\n<em>General Theory of Knowledge</em> (1918/25) and his post-Tractarian\nepistemology (1935a, 1935b). (Schlick also showed little enthusiasm\nfor the constructivist tendencies which already the manifesto of 1929\nhad celebrated.) Allowing for some simplification, it must be noted\nthat Schlick\u2019s attack on metaphysics (which gradually weakened\nanyway) presupposed a non-constructivist reading of the criterion of\nsignificance. Whether his conception can escape the charge\nself-refutation must be left open here.</p>", "<p>\nMuch confusion exists concerning the Vienna Circle and history, that\nis, both concerning the Vienna Circle\u2019s attitude towards the\nhistory of philosophy and science and concerning its own place in that\nhistory. As more has been learnt about the history of the Vienna\nCircle itself\u2014the development and variety of its doctrines as\nwell as its own prehistory as a philosophical forum\u2014this\nconfusion can be addressed more adequately.</p>", "<p>\nAs the unnamed villain of the opening sentences of Kuhn\u2019s\ninfluential <em>Structure of Scientific Revolutions</em> (1962),\nlogical empiricism is often accused of lacking historical\nconsciousness and any sense of the embedding of philosophy and science\nin the wider culture of the day. Again it can hardly be denied that\nmuch logical empiricist philosophy, especially after World War II, was\nahistorical in outlook and asocial in its orientation.\nReichenbach\u2019s distinction (1938) between the contexts of\ndiscovery and justification\u2014which echoed distinctions made since\nKant (Hoyningen-Huene 1987) and was already observed under a different\nname by Carnap in the <em>Aufbau</em>\u2014was often employed to\nshield philosophy not only from contact with the sciences as practiced\nbut also culture at large. But this was not the case for the Vienna\nCircle generally. On the one hand, unlike Reichenbach, who drew a\nsharp break between traditional philosophy and the new philosophy of\nlogical empiricism in his popular <em>The Rise of Scientific\nPhilosophy</em> (1951), Schlick was very much concerned to stress the\nremaining continuities with traditional philosophy and its cultural\nmission in his last paper (1938). On the other hand, on the left wing\nof the Circle scientific meta-theory was opened to the empirical\nsciences. To be sure, Carnap for his own part was happy to withdraw to\nthe \u201cicy slopes\u201d of the logic of science and showed no\nresearch interest of his own in the history of science or philosophy,\nlet alone its social history. By way of the division of labor he left\nit to Neurath and Frank to pursue the historical and practice-related\nsociological questions that the pure logic of science had to leave\nunaddressed. (See, e.g., Neurath\u2019s studies of the history of\noptics (1915, 1916), Frank\u2019s homage to Mach (1917), his\npedagogical papers in (1949b) and his concern with the practice of\ntheory acceptance and change in (1956); cf. Uebel 2000 and Nemeth\n2007.) Moreover, it must be noted that Neurath himself all along had\nplanned a volume on the history of science for the International\nEncyclopedia of Science, a volume that in the end became Kuhn\u2019s\n<em>Structure</em>. Its publication in this series is often regarded as supremely ironical, given\nhow Kuhn\u2019s book is commonly read. But this is not only to\noverlook that the surviving editors of that series, Carnap and Morris\nwere happy to accept the manuscript, but also that Carnap found himself in\npositive agreement with Kuhn (Reisch 1991, Irzik and\nGrunberg 1995; cf. Friedman 2001). Finally, one look at the 1929\nmanifesto shows that its authors were very aware of and promoted the\nlinks between their philosophy of science and the socio-political and\ncultural issues of the day.</p>", "<p>\nTurning to the historical influences on the Vienna Circle itself, the\nscholarship of recent decades has unearthed a much greater variety\nthan was previously recognized. Scientifically, the strongest\ninfluences belonged to the physicists Helmholtz, Mach and Boltzmann,\nthe mathematicians Hilbert and Klein and the logicians Frege and\nRussell; amongst contemporaries, Einstein was revered above all\nothers. The Circle\u2019s philosophical influences extend far beyond\nthat of the British empiricists (especially Hume), to include the\nFrench conventionalists Henri Poincar\u00e9, Pierre Duhem and Abel\nRey, American pragmatists like James and, in German-language\nphilosophy, the Neo-Kantianism of both the Heidelberg and the Marburg\nvariety, even the early phenomenology of Husserl as well as the\nAustrian tradition of Bolzano\u2019s logic and the Brentano school.\n(See Frank 1949a for the influence of the French conventionalists; for the importance of\nNeo-Kantianism for Carnap, see Friedman 1987, 1992, Sauer 1989,\nRichardson 1998, Mormann 2007; for Neo-Kantianism in Schlick, see\nCoffa 1991, Ch. 9 and Gower 2000; for the significance of Husserl for\nCarnap, see Sarkar 2004, Ryckman 2007, Carus 2016, Damb\u00f6ck 2018; for the influence of and sympathies for pragmatism see Frank 1949a and Uebel 2016; the Bolzano-Brentano\nconnection is explored in Haller 1986.) It is against this very wide\nbackground of influences that the seminal force must be assessed that\ntheir contemporary Wittgenstein exerted. The literature on the\nrelation between Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle is vast but very\noften suffers from an over-simplified conception of the latter. (See\nStern 2007 for an attempt by a Wittgenstein scholar to redress the\nbalance.) Needless to say, different wings of the Circle show these\ninfluences to different degrees. German Neo-Kantianism was important\nfor Schlick and particularly so for Carnap, whereas the Austrian\nnaturalist-pragmatist influences were particularly strong on Hahn,\nFrank and Neurath. Frege was of great importance for Carnap, less so\nfor Hahn who looked to Russell. Most importantly, by no means all\nmembers of the Vienna Circle sought to emulate Wittgenstein\u2014thus\nthe division between the faction around Schlick and the left wing (see Uebel 2017).</p>", "<p>\nWhile these findings leave numerous questions open, they nevertheless refute the standard picture of Vienna Circle philosophy which confuses A.J. Ayer\u2019s\n<em>Language, Truth and Logic</em> with the real thing. Ayer offered a version of British empiricism (Berkeley\u2019s epistemic phenomenalism updated with Russellian logic) and paid no attention, for instance, to the Circle\u2019s overarching concern with establishing\nthe objectivity claim of science. Ayer\u2019s remark in the\npreface to his later anthology <em>Logical Positivism</em> that his own <em>Language, Truth and Logic</em> \u201cdid\nsomething to popularize what may be called the classical position of\nthe Vienna Circle\u201d (1959b, 8) is highly misleading therefore. What he\ncalled \u201cthe classical position\u201d was at best a partial characterisation of the starting\nposition of some\u2014by no means all\u2014of its members, a position which by 1932 the left\nwing as a whole rejected and even Schlick had no reason to\nendorse any longer.</p>", "<p>\nAll that said by way of embedding the Vienna Circle\u2019s philosophy\nin its time, one must also ask whether its members understood their\nown position correctly. Here one issue in particular has become\nincreasingly prominent and raises questions that are of importance for\nphilosophy of science still today. That is whether, after all, logical\nempiricism did have the resources to understand correctly the then\nparadigm modern science, the general theory of relativity. According\nto the standard logical empiricist story (Schlick 1915, 1917, 1921,\n1922), their theory conclusively refuted the Kantian conception of the\nsynthetic <em>a priori</em>: Euclidean geometry was not only one\ngeometry amongst many, it also was not the one that characterized\nempirical reality. With one of its most prominent exemplars refuted,\nthe synthetic <em>a priori</em> was deemed overthrown altogether. As\nnoted, Schlick convinced the young Reichenbach to drop his residually\nKantian talk of constitutive principles and speak of conventions\ninstead. Likewise Schlick rejected efforts by Ernst Cassirer (see his\n1921, developing themes from his 1910) to make do with a merely\nrelative <em>a priori</em> in helping along scientific\nself-reflection. Even though much later, and on the independent\ngrounds of quantum physics, Frank attested to the increased proximity\nof his and Cassirer\u2019s understanding of scientific theories\n(1938), Schlick\u2019s disregard of Cassirer\u2019s efforts remains\nnotable.</p>", "<p>\nMost controversial is how the issue of general relativity as a\ntouchstone for competing philosophies of science was framed: having\ndismissed Kant\u2019s own synthetic <em>a priori</em> for its\nmistaken apodicity, no time was spared for discussion of its then\ncontemporary development in Neo-Kantianism as a merely relative but\nstill constitutive <em>a priori</em>. Now in the philosophy of\nphysics, this omission\u2014committed both by Schlick and\nReichenbach\u2014has recently come back to haunt logical empiricists\nwith considerable vengeance. Thus it has been argued that the\nSchlick-Reichenbach reading of general relativity as embodying the\nstandard logical empiricist model of scientific theories, with high\ntheory linked to its observational strata by purely conventional\ncoordinative definitions, is deeply mistaken in representing the local\nmetric of space-time not to be empirically but conventionally\ndetermined as in special relativity (Ryckman 1992) and that\nit is instead only the tradition of transcendental idealism that\npossesses the resources to understand the achievements of mathematical\nphysics (Ryckman 2005; cf. Friedman 2001). It is tempting to speak of\nthe return of the repressed Neo-Kantian opposition. But it is tempting\ntoo to note that Schlick\u2019s and Reichenbach\u2019s mistake was\nalready corrected quietly and without fanfare by Carnap (see the\nexample in his 1934/37, \u00a750). Clearly then, the mistake was not\ninevitable and inherent in logical empiricist theorizing about\nscience as such. (For discussion of different criticism of the Circle\u2019s reading of Einstein, especially his relation to Mach, see DiSalle 2006, Ch.4.)</p>", "<p>\nThe charge of a constitutive failing would rather seem to come from\nDemopoulos\u2019s challenge to the two-languages model (nearly)\nuniversally adopted in logical empiricism (forthcoming). Importantly,\nthis challenge does not proceed, as some previous ones have, from the\nimpossibility of drawing a sharp distinction between the observational and the theoretical (Putnam\n1962). Rather, the two-languages model falsely supposes that the\nprocess of testing scientific hypotheses must only advert to\ntheoretically uncontaminated facts and so results in misunderstanding\nthe empirical import of theoretical claims (as in the Newman problem).\nInstead, a conception of theory-mediated measurement and testing is\nsuggested that extends responsiveness to observational data to\ntheoretical claims by showing them to be essentially implicated in the\nproduction of observed experimental consequences. Hoping to advance\nbeyond the stalemate between realism and instrumentalism without\nappealing to question-begging semantics, Demopoulos here breaks with a\nsupposition upheld by Carnap throughout, namely that the theoretical\nlanguage be regarded as an essentially uninterpreted, at best partially\ninterpreted calculus. Whatever the outcome of this challenge, it is\nremarkable how on this far-reaching and fundamental issue contemporary\nphilosophy of science intersects with the history of philosophy of\nscience.</p>", "<p>\nIn conclusion, the results of the discussions in section 3 can be\nbriefly summarised. To start with, the dominant popular picture of the\nVienna Circle as a monolithic group of simple-minded verificationists\nwho pursued a blandly reductivist philosophy with foundationalist\nambitions is widely off the mark. Instead, the Vienna Circle must be\nseen as a forum in which widely divergent ideas about how empiricism\ncan cope with modern empirical and formal science were discussed.\nWhile by no means all of the philosophical initiatives started by\nmembers of the Vienna Circle have born fruit, it is neither the case\nthat all of them have remained fruitless. Nor is it the case that\neverything once distinctive of Vienna Circle philosophy has to be\ndiscarded.</p>", "<p>\nConsider verificationism. While the idea to show metaphysics\nonce-and-for-all and across-the-board to be not false but\nmeaningless\u2014arguably the most distinctive thesis associated with\nthe Vienna Circle\u2014did indeed have to be abandoned, two elements\nof that program remain so far unrefuted. On the one hand, it remains\nan option to pursue the search for a criterion of empirical\nsignificance in terms of constructed, formal languages further along\nthe lines opened by Carnap with his theory-relative proposal of 1956\n(and its later defense against critics). On the other\nhand\u2014albeit at the cost of merging with the pragmatist tradition\nand losing the apparent Viennese distinctiveness\u2014the option to\nneglect as cognitively irrelevant, and in this sense metaphysical, all\nassertions whose truth or falsity would not make a difference remains\nas open as it always was. In addition it must be noted that, properly\nformulated, neither the formalist version of the criterion of\nempirical significance for constructed languages nor the pragmatist\nversion of the criterion for natural languages are threatened by\nself-refutation.</p>", "<p>\nConsider analyticity. Here again, the traditional idea\u2014sometimes\ndefended by some members\u2014did show itself indefensible, but this\nleaves Carnap\u2019s framework-relative interpretation of analyticity\nand the understanding of the <em>a priori</em> as equally relative\nto be explored. As noted, if Carnap\u2019s ramseyfications can be\ndefended, an analytic/synthetic distinction could be upheld also for\nthe theoretical languages of science. In any case, however, the\ndistinction between framework principles and content continues to be\ndrawable on a case by case basis.</p>", "<p>\nConsider reductionism and foundationalism. While it cannot be denied\nthat various reductionist projects were at one time or another\nundertaken by members of the Vienna Circle and that not all of its\nmembers were epistemological anti-foundationalists either from the\nstart or at the end, it is clearly false to paint all of them with\nreductivist and/or foundationalist brushes. This is particularly true\nof the members of the so-called left wing of the Circle, all of whom\nended up with anti-foundationalist and anti-reductionist positions\n(even though this did involve instrumentalism for some).</p>", "<p>\nConsider also, however, the challenges mentioned above to the\nfundamental tenets of logical empiricism that remain issues of intense\ndiscussion: challenges to its conception of the nature of empirical\ntheory and of what is distinctive about the formal sciences. That to\nthis day no agreement has been reached about how its proposals are to\nbe replaced is not something that is unique to logical empiricism as a\nphilosophical movement, but that they remain on the table, as it were,\nshows the ongoing relevance and centrality of its work for philosophy\nof science.</p>", "<p>\nWhether the indicated qualifications and/or modifications count as\ndefeats of the original project depends at least in part on what\nprecisely is meant to be rejected when metaphysics is rejected and\nthat in turn depends on what the positive vision for philosophy\nconsists in. Here again one must differentiate. While some members\nended with considerable more sympathy for traditional philosophy than\nthey displayed in the Circle\u2019s heyday\u2014and may thus be\ncharged with partial surrender\u2014others stuck to their guns. For\nthem, what remained of philosophy stayed squarely in the deflationist\nvein established by the linguistic turn. They offered explications of\ncontested concepts or practices that, they hoped, would prove useful.\nImportantly, the explications given can be of two sorts: the formal\nexplications of the logic of science by means of exemplary models of\nconstructed languages, and the more informal explications of the\nempirical theory of science given by spelling out how certain\ntheoretical desiderata can be attained more or less under practical\nconstraints. This has been designated as the bipartite metatheory\nconception of scientific philosophy and ascribed to the left wing of\nthe Circle as an ideal unifying its diverse methodologies (Uebel 2007,\nCh. 12, 2015). Readers will note therefore that despite his enormous\ncontribution to the development of Vienna Circle philosophy, it is not\nSchlick\u2019s version of it that appears to this reviewer to be of\ncontinuing relevance to contemporary philosophy\u2014unlike, in their\nvery different but not incompatible ways, Carnap\u2019s and\nNeurath\u2019s and Frank\u2019s. This may be taken as a partial\nendorsement of Hempel\u2019s 1991 judgement (quoted in sect. 1\nabove), against which, however, Carnap has here been re-claimed for\nthe Neurathian wing.</p>", "<p>\nNeedless to say, recent work on Vienna Circle philosophies continues\nto inspire a variety of approaches to the legacy they constitute\n(besides prompting continuing excavations of other members\u2019\nnon-standard variants; e.g., on Feigl see Neuber 2011). There is\nMichael Friedman\u2019s extremely wide-ranging project (2001, 2010,\n2012) to use the shortcomings of Vienna Circle philosophies as a\nspringboard for developing a renewed Kantian philosophy that also\novercomes the failings of neo-Kantianism and provides a\nphilosophy-cum-history fit for our post-Kuhnian times. Then there is\nRichardson\u2019s proposal (2008) to turn the ambition to develop a\nscientific philosophy into a research programme for the history of\nscience, so as to reveal more clearly the real world dynamics and\nlimitations of philosophy as a scientific metatheory. And there is\nCarus\u2019s suggestion (2007) that Carnap\u2019s minimalist\nexplicationism be placed in the service of a renewed Enlightenment\nagenda (continuing the task of the \u201cscientific world\nconception\u201d). This connects with the current metaphilosophical interest in conceptual engineering, the relevance of Carnap\u2019s work to which becoming increasingly recognised (Justus 2012, Wagner 2012, Brun 2016, Reck and Dutilh Novaes 2017, Dutilh Novaes forthcoming, Lutz forthcoming). All along, of course, Vienna Circle philosophies\nalso continue to serve as foils for alternative and self-consciously\npost-positivist programs, fruitfully so when informed by the results of recent\nscholarship (e.g. Ebbs 2017).</p>", "<p>\nIt would appear then that despite continued resistance to recent\nrevisionist scholarship\u2014a resistance that consists not so much\nin contesting but in ignoring its results\u2014the fortune of Vienna\nCircle philosophy has turned again. Restored from the numerous\ndistortions of its teachings that accrued over generations of acolytes\nand opponents, the Vienna Circle is being recognized again as a force\nof considerable philosophical sophistication. Not only is it the case\nthat its members profoundly influenced the actual development of\nanalytical philosophy of science with conceptual initiatives that,\ntypically, were seen through to their bitter end. It is also the case\nthat some of its members offered proposals and suggested approaches\nthat were not taken up widely at the time (if at all), but that are\nrelevant again today. Much like its precursors Frege, Russell and\nWittgenstein, the conventionalists Poincar\u00e9 and Duhem, the\npragmatists Peirce and Dewey\u2014and like its contemporaries from\nReichenbach\u2019s Berlin Group and the Warsaw-Lvov school of logic\nto the Neo-Kantian Cassirer\u2014the Vienna Circle affords a valuable\nvantage point on contemporary philosophy of empirical and formal\nscience.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "vienna-circle"]}

Since the\ncategory of facts is a formal category, a semantic or ontological\ncategory, we then look in some detail at different formal theories of\nfacts and their ilk.</p>", "<p>\nWhat might a fact be? Three popular views about the nature of facts\ncan be distinguished:</p>", "<ul>\n\n<li>A fact is just a true truth-bearer,</li>\n\n<li>A fact is just an obtaining state of affairs,</li>\n\n<li>A fact is just a <em>sui generis</em> type of entity in which\nobjects exemplify properties or stand in relations.</li>\n</ul>", "<p>\nIn order to understand these claims and the relations between them it\nis necessary to appeal to some accounts of truth, truth-bearers,\nstates of affairs, obtaining, objects, properties, relations and\nexemplification. Propositions are a popular candidate for the role of\nwhat is true or false. One view of propositions has it that these are\ncomposed exclusively of concepts, individual concepts (for example,\nthe concept associated with the proper name \u201cSam\u201d),\ngeneral concepts (the concept expressed by the predicates \u201cis\nsad\u201d and \u201c<em>est triste</em>\u201d) and formal concepts\n(for example, the concept expressed by \u201cor\u201d). Concepts so\nunderstood are things we can understand. Properties and relations, we\nmay then say, are not concepts, for they are not the sort of thing we\nunderstand. Properties are exemplified by objects and objects fall\nunder concepts. Similarly, objects stand in relations but fall under\nrelational concepts.</p>", "<p>\nIt will be convenient to understand the view that a fact is just a\n<em>sui generis</em> type of entity in which objects exemplify\nproperties or stand in relations as relying on the way of\nunderstanding properties and relations just sketched. We shall refer\nto the view as the claim that facts are exemplifications. Similarly,\nwe may understand the claim that a fact is an obtaining state of\naffairs to say that a state of affairs is something which contains one\nor more objects and at least one property or relation and that a state\nof affairs obtains if an object exemplifies a property or one or more\nobjects stand in a relation. \u201cObtains\u201d (German:\n\u201c<em>besteht</em>\u201d) belongs to the same family of\npredicates as \u201cis true\u201d. Just as it is often argued that\nthe truth-predicate is tenseless and timeless, so it is sometimes\nargued or assumed that \u201cobtains\u201d is tenseless and\ntimeless. A distinct question: Is \u201cobtain\u201d not simply a\nfancy way of saying \u201cexists\u201d? (Sundholm 1994). No, it is\nsometimes claimed. Obtaining is a mode of being. If a state of affairs\nobtains, then an obtaining state of affairs exists, a fact exists. In\nthis respect, \u201cobtains\u201d resembles \u201cendures\u201d.\nThings endure. If a thing endures, then the enduring thing exists.</p>", "<p>\nBut it should be noted that some philosophers use\n\u201cproposition\u201d or \u201cstructured proposition\u201d\n(Soames 2010) to refer to what are here called \u201cstates of\naffairs\u201d and that some philosophers do not distinguish between\nproperties and concepts. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that\nin ordinary English the expression \u201cstate of affairs\u201d is\nnot normally used to refer to something which obtains or fails to\nobtain. It is used to refer to what is the case. Philosophers who talk\nof \u201cstates of affairs\u201d as obtaining or failing to obtain\nare employing the term as a technical term, often as a translation of\nthe German word \u201c<em>Sachverhalt</em>\u201d. Finally, states of\naffairs, unlike facts, are commonly said to last or endure, whereas\n\u201c<em>Sachverhalte</em>\u201d do not last or endure.</p>", "<p>\nThe two views of facts as exemplifications of properties and as\nobtaining states of affairs raise many metaphysical and ontological\nquestions and are often appealed to in giving answers to metaphysical\nand ontological questions. They are also often appealed to in answers\nto questions about semantics and intentionality. Finally, facts are\nsometimes invoked in an area where semantics and ontology connect, the\ntheory of truthmaking. Throughout the twentieth century the categories\nof fact and state of affairs have also been been the object of\nscepticism (see Betti 2015).</p>", "<p>\nThe metaphysical and ontological questions which are raised by the two\nviews of facts mentioned include the following: Are the properties and\nrelations which go to make up facts abstract (repeatable) universals\nor bearer-specific (non-repeatable) properties and relations (tropes)?\nIf they are abstract universals, are these such that they are always\nexemplified, as friends of \u201cAristotelian\u201d universals\nclaim, or not, as friends of \u201cPlatonic\u201d universals claim?\nAnd are they qualitative only (the property of being round) or also\nsubstantial (the property of being a man)? Are there facts containing\nabstract objects and properties, for example the fact that 2 is a\nnumber? Is a fact which contains a concrete object, for example the\nfact that Sam is sad, itself concrete or abstract? Are there facts\nwhich are formally complex, for example negative or conditional facts?\nWhat is the relation between facts, on the one hand, and concrete\nevents, processes and states, on the other hand? Do objects stand in\nrelations <em>because</em> the objects and the relations they stand in\nare parts of facts? What are the identity conditions for facts? Are\nthere states of affairs which do not obtain? May such states of\naffairs contain non-existent objects? Are states of affairs abstract\nentities which exist necessarily? Do facts understood as\nexemplifications of properties come in two kinds\u2014the\ncontingently existing ones and the non-contingently existing ones?\n(For discussions of all these questions see the entry on\n <a href=\"../states-of-affairs/\">states of affairs</a>.)\n If concrete events, processes and states are identical with facts or\ncan be constructed out of facts, then it is plausible to think that\ncausality is a relation between facts. If they are not identical with\nfacts and cannot be constructed out of facts, then it is plausible to\nthink that causality is a relation between events and states and that\ncausality should not be identified with causal explanations. For\ndiscussions of the view that one or both of the relata of the causal\nrelation are facts, see Vendler 1967a,b; Menzies 1989; Mellor 1995;\nPersson 1997; and also the entry on\n <a href=\"../causation-metaphysics/\">the metaphysics of causation</a>.</p>", "<p>\nThe assumption that facts <em>contain</em> objects, properties and\nrelations as proper parts may be criticised (Lowe 1998; Vallicella\n2000; K\u00fcnne 2003).\nOne natural mereological principle is that the proper parts of the\nmost basic kinds of whole belong to the same general ontological\ncategory to which their wholes belong. Thus parts of things or\nsubstances are things or substances and parts of processes are\nprocesses. The view that the fact that Sam is sad contains a substance\nand a property offends against this principle: substances and\nproperties belong to different kinds and neither substances nor\nproperties, it seems, are facts. Perhaps the natural mereological\nprinciple should be rejected in favor of the view that entities of any\nkind may come together to form a whole. But friends of facts tend to\nthink of facts as forming a very natural kind of whole. Another\npossible view is that Sam is a fact rather than part of a fact\n(Armstrong 1997; Johansson 2004: 34; R\u00e9canati 2000; Bergmann\n1967).</p>", "<p>\nEven if facts or states of affairs do not <em>contain</em> objects\nsuch as substances or events, some may still <em>be about</em>, or\n<em>concern</em>, such objects. This notion of aboutness has recently\nbeen assigned heavy metaphysical duties. Thus, Shamik Dasgupta (2014,\n2017) defines <em>qualitative facts</em> as facts which are not\nabout any particular individuals, and argues that all the basic facts\nthat constitute the universe are qualitative, the individualistic\n(i.e., non-qualitative) facts being grounded in that qualitative basis\n(see below on grounding as a relation between facts). And Dan Marshall\nexploits the notion of factual aboutness for the purpose of theorizing\nabout <em>intrinsicality</em>. In his 2016a, he argues that a number\nof different notions of intrinsicality can be analysed in terms of the\nnotion of a state of affairs <em>being intrinsically about</em>\nsomething, and in his 2016b he defends a particular account of that\nsort.</p>", "<p>\nOne ontological role for states of affairs and facts is to be the\nprimary bearers of modality. Suppose that facts are obtaining states\nof affairs. Then we may distinguish the obtaining state of affairs\nthat Sam is sad from the obtaining states of affairs that Sam is\npossibly sad, that Sam is probably sad, and that Sam ought to be sad.\nHere the modal properties qualify the property of being sad and so\nqualify Sam. They are <em>de re</em> modalities. And, so the view\ngoes, the place of such modal properties is in states of affairs. (A\nstate of affairs is, as the German terms\n\u201c<em>Sachverhalt</em>\u201d,\n\u201c<em>Sachverh\u00e4ltnis</em>\u201d suggest, a relation between\nthings, the way things stand with respect to one another,\n\u201c<em>wie die Sachen sich zueinander verhalten</em>\u201d.) A\nfurther claim is that some <em>de dicto</em> modalities properly\nqualify states of affairs: the state of affairs that Sam is sad\nprobably obtains/possibly obtains/ought to obtain. Suppose that a fact\nis just the exemplification of properties. Then we may distinguish the\nfact that Sam is a man and the fact that Sam is necessarily a man. But\na friend of facts like the last one then has to accept that not all\nfacts are formally simple.</p>", "<p>\nAnother possible ontological role for states of affairs and facts is\nto provide the terms for the tie of grounding or explanation. The fact\nthat there is an explosion explains the fact that Sam\u2019s head\nturns (causal explanation). The fact that Mary slapped Sam is\nexplained by the fact that Sam is a sexist (explanation of action by\nreference to an \u201cobjective\u201d reason; Dancy 2000). The fact\nthat Sam admires Mary is explained by the fact that she is charming\n(explanation of feeling by reference to an \u201cobjective\u201d\nreason). The fact that there is a one-one correlation between the\n<i>F</i>s and the <i>G</i>s is explained by the fact that the number\nof <i>F</i>s = the number of <i>G</i>s (non-causal, conceptual or\nessential explanation). Sceptics about such claims ask what \u201cthe\nfact that <i>p</i> explains the fact that <i>q</i>\u201d adds to\n\u201c<i>q</i> because <i>p</i>\u201d. (See Correia &amp; Schnieder\n2012, Mulligan 2007, Trogdon 2013, and the entry on\n <a href=\"../grounding/\">metaphysical grounding</a>.)</p>", "<p>\nAppeal to facts has also been made in order to give a semantics for\ncounterfactuals (Kratzer 2002). A premise semantics for\ncounterfactual, Kratzer argues, relies on facts: </p>", "<blockquote>\n\n<p>\nin a premise semantics, a \u201cwould\u201d-counterfactual is true\nin a world <i>w</i> iff every way of adding as many facts of <i>w</i>\nto the antecedent as consistency allows reaches a point where the\nresulting set logically implies the consequent. On the other hand, a\n\u201cmight\u201d-counterfactual is true in a world <i>w</i> iff not\nevery way of adding as many facts of <i>w</i> to the antecedent as\nconsistency allows reaches a point where adding the consequent would\nresult in an inconsistent set. </p>\n</blockquote>", "<p>\nThose facts, she argues, have to be propositions, but they must be\nhighly specific, almost as specific as facts conceived of as\nparticulars (see\n <a href=\"#FactKnow\">section 1.3</a>\n below).</p>", "<p>\nFinally, certain metaphysical disputes of the realism/anti-realism\ntype are sometimes characterized in terms of facts: in such a dispute,\nthe realist is said to countenance facts of a certain kind, whereas\nthe anti-realist is said to reject facts of that kind. The\ndisagreement between realists about tense (or A-theorists) and\nanti-realists about tense (or B-theorists), for instance, is sometimes\ntaken to boil down to a disagreement about the question whether there\nare tensed facts: the former answer \u2018Yes\u2019 while the latter\nsay \u2018No\u2019. (See, e.g., Mellor 1998, Fine 2005 and Correia\n&amp; Rosenkranz 2011.)</p>", "<p>\nOne difficulty faced by such characterizations is that of making clear\nwhat the relevant facts are supposed to be. The difficulty is\nparticularly acute in certain debates, for instance in the debate over\ntense realism. For what is it for a fact to be tensed? It cannot\nsimply be said that a tensed fact is a fact that can be referred to by\nmeans of a tensed description of type \u201cthe fact that\n<i>p</i>\u201d, where \u201c<i>p</i>\u201d is a tensed sentence.\nFor it is open to a B-theorist to hold that such expressions do refer\nto (tenseless) facts\u2014e.g., that \u201cthe fact that Sam is\nlying\u201d refers, at any time <i>t</i>, to a fact which can also be\nreferred to (at any time) using the description \u201cthe fact that\nSam is lying at <i>t</i>\u201d. Another suggestion is that a fact is\ntensed if and only if it is transient, i.e., sometimes obtains and\nsometimes fails to obtain. Yet, it may be replied, even if the\nproposed characterization does capture some tensed facts, it leaves\naside a number of other such facts, e.g., those which can be referred\nto by \u201cthe fact that Sam is currently sitting or not currently\nsitting\u201d and (barring certain forms of indeterminism) \u201cthe\nfact that if Sam is currently sitting, then it was the case yesterday\nthat Sam would be sitting one day hence\u201d, respectively.</p>", "<p>\n\u201cKnow\u201d in instances of the locution \u201c<i>x</i> knows\nthat <i>p</i>\u201d is factive: if <i>x</i> knows that <i>p</i>, then\n<i>p</i>. Similarly, \u201cknow\u201d in instances of the locution\n\u201c<i>x</i> knows <i>y</i>\u201d is veridical: if <i>x</i> knows\n<i>y</i>, is acquainted with <i>y</i>, then there is a <i>y</i> and\n<i>x</i> knows <i>y</i>.</p>", "<p>\nIs knowledge that <i>p</i> knowledge of facts? Is coming to know (cf.\n\u201c<em>Erkennen</em>\u201d) that <i>p</i> a form of contact with\nfacts, where facts are understood as something other than true\ntruth-bearers? Husserl, Russell, Vendler and Hossack (Husserl\n1900\u20131901; Russell 1906\u20131907; Vendler 1967a, 1972; Hossack\n2007) reply affirmatively to one of these questions; thus Russell at\none point argues that a perception has a single object, such as\n\u201cknife-to-left-of-book\u201d, an entity he first called a\n\u201ccomplex\u201d and then \u201ca fact\u201d (Russell\n<em>ONTF</em>). From Ramsey to Williamson (Ramsey 1927 [1931]; Vickers\n2004; Williamson 2000) many philosophers have replied negatively.</p>", "<p>\nWhat may be said in favor of the view? Consider the atomic\npredication <em>Fa</em>, where this is a formula that a logician would\nuse to represent the claim that object <em>a</em> has\nproperty <em>F</em>. Coming to know that\n<em>Fa</em>, in the simplest cases, involves acquaintance with objects\nand properties. Coming to know that the wall is red by seeing that it\nis red often involves seeing the wall. The wall is not any sort of\nconcept. According to a popular theory in perceptual psychology,\nseeing that the wall is red or straight typically involves perception\nof a constant property, the redness or straightness of the wall, and\nperception of it as constant (\u201cproperty constancy\u201d,\n\u201ccolor constancy\u201d, \u201cshape constancy\u201d). These\nproperties are not concepts. There is thus some reason for thinking\nthat perceptually coming to know that <i>p</i>, in the simplest cases,\ninvolves epistemic contact with objects and with properties. If that\nis right, then two components of the view that to come to know that\n<i>p</i> in such cases is to come to have knowledge of facts are\nplausible. But even if perceptual knowledge of facts is allowed, it is\nnot clear why one should think that instances of \u201cknowledge that\n<i>p</i>\u201d or of \u201ccoming to know that <i>p</i>\u201d in\nwhich the substitutions for \u201c<i>p</i>\u201d are logically\ncomplex, constitute knowledge of robust facts. Similarly, if we\nconsider the many and various types of coming to know that <i>p</i> in\nwhich the source of knowledge is not sensory perception but, for\nexample, testimony or inference, we may think that in such cases there\nis no reason to think that what we come to know are facts.</p>", "<p>\nKratzer\u2019s (2002) account of knowledge of facts is applied to\nGettier problems (Gettier 1963, see the entry on\n <a href=\"../knowledge-analysis/\">the analysis of knowledge</a>).\n She puts forward a view according to which facts are particulars\nwhich exemplify propositions (cf. Baylis 1948)\u2014just as other\nparticulars such as tables and persons exemplify properties. (She\nmodels these facts and propositions within Situation Semantics, as\nsituations of a certain sort and sets of situations, respectively, but\nwe need not go into the details here. Note that, as we saw in\n <a href=\"#FactOntoMeta\">section 1.2</a>\n above, she also countenances facts which <em>are</em> propositions.)\nShe then proposes the following analysis of knowledge:</p>", "<div class=\"indent\">\n\n<p>\n<i>S</i> knows <i>p</i> if and only if</p>\n\n<ol type=\"i\">\n\n<li>There is a fact <i>f</i> that exemplifies <i>p</i>,</li>\n\n<li><i>S</i> believes <i>p</i> <em>de re</em> of <i>f</i>, and</li>\n\n<li><i>S</i> can rule out relevant possible alternatives of <i>f</i>\nthat do not exemplify <i>p</i>.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>", "<p>\nIt is condition (ii), Kratzer argues, which deals with Gettier cases.\nTake the second type of case discussed by Gettier. Smith is justified\nin believing the false proposition that Jones owns a Ford. Therefore\nhe is justified in believing the proposition that Jones owns a Ford or\nBrown is in Barcelona. Now Brown happens to be in Barcelona, but Smith\nhas no idea about where Brown is\u2014in particular, he is not\njustified in believing that Brown is in Barcelona. Intuitively, Smith\ndoes not know the disjunctive proposition he is justified in\nbelieving. But that proposition is true, and so the standard analysis\nof knowledge fails. The analysis in terms of beliefs <em>de re</em> of\nfacts fares better, Kratzer argues. For, she claims, the fact\nexemplified by the disjunctive proposition is the fact that Brown is\nin Barcelona, and Smith\u2019s belief is not a <em>de re</em> belief\nabout that fact.</p>", "<p>\nWe have mentioned the view that facts may explain actions and mental\nstates and the view that facts are what we know. Facts are also\ninvoked in the philosophy of mind by philosophers who claim that\njudgments or beliefs enjoy the property of <em>intentionality</em>, of\nbeing \u201cdirected towards\u201d something, because they\n<em>represent</em> states of affairs or are psychological relations to\nstates of affairs and that judgments and beliefs are correct or\nsatisfied only if states of affairs obtain, that is, if facts exist.\nVersions of these claims are given by many philosophers from Meinong,\nthe early Husserl and Russell to Searle (Searle 1983). Analogous\nclaims in semantics are sometimes made about propositions or other\ntruth-bearers: the proposition that Sam is sad represents the state of\naffairs that Sam is sad and is true only if this state of affairs\nobtains. Versions of this view are given by Husserl, Wittgenstein and\nCarnap. See the\n <a href=\"history-facts.html\">supplementary document on the History of Philosophies of Facts</a>.</p>", "<p>\nOne objection to the view that the judgment that Sam is sad represents\na state of affairs is that although the judger arguably thinks of Sam\nand of his sadness, he may not possess any concept of a state of\naffairs. (Consider the analogous claim that one may judge that\n<i>p</i> without employing the concept of truth). Perhaps then a\njudgment represents a state of affairs but does not represent it\n<em>as</em> a state of affairs. One objection to this claim is that it\ncommits one to the ontological view that there are states of affairs\nwhich do not obtain, the states of affairs represented by false\njudgments or beliefs.</p>", "<p>\nIf we reject the view that judgments and beliefs represent states of\naffairs, it is still possible to claim that judgments and beliefs have\ncorrectness conditions which mention states of affairs: if <i>x</i>\njudges correctly that <i>p</i>, then the state of affairs that\n<i>p</i> obtains. And if this is plausible, so too is the further\nclaim that if <i>x</i> judges correctly that <i>p</i>, then <i>x</i>\njudges correctly that <i>p</i> because the state of affairs that\n<i>p</i> obtains. Facts make judgments correct.</p>", "<p>\nDoes the proposition that Sam is sad represent the state of affairs\nthat Sam is sad? It may be objected that the proposition does not\nrefer to anything as a state of affairs. And once again the friend of\nstates of affairs may retreat to the safer claims that the proposition\nthat Sam is sad is true only if the state of affairs that Sam is sad\nobtains and that if the proposition that Sam is sad is true, it is\ntrue because the state of affairs obtains. Facts make propositions\ntrue.</p>", "<p>\nFacts, then, are perhaps qualified to play the role of what makes\njudgments correct and propositions true. But the theory of correctness\nand of truth does not require us to accept that there are facts.\nIndeed it may be thought that the requirements of such a theory are\nsatisfied by the observations that a judgment that <i>p</i> is correct\nonly if <i>p</i>, and that the proposition that <i>p</i> is true only\nif <i>p</i>. If arguments in metaphysics or epistemology persuade us\nthat there are facts, then we may perhaps appeal to facts in giving\naccounts of correctness and of truth. In the case of the theory of\ncorrectness conditions for judgment and belief the argument that\nknowledge is of facts together with the view that, contrary to a long\nand influential tradition, the theory of belief and of judgment\npresupposes a theory of knowledge (Williamson 2000) may persuade us\nthat facts make judgments and beliefs correct.</p>", "<p>\nThe view that facts make propositions or other truth-bearers true is\none theory among many of truthmaking. The theory of truthmaking deals\nwith questions at the intersection between ontology, metaphysics and\nsemantics. The view that facts are what make truth-bearers true is the\noldest theory of truthmaking. One central choice within truthmaker\ntheory is between acceptance and rejection of truthmaker maximalism.\nTruthmaker maximalism is the view that every truth has a truthmaker.\n(It is an analogue of claims about modalities other than the modality\nof truth such as that every necessity is made necessary, that every\nprobability has a probabiliser, that if something has a value there is\nsomething which makes it valuable, a \u201cvalifier\u201d etc.)\nFactualist truthmaker maximalism says that every truth is made true by\na fact. Factualist truthmaker maximalism comes in many shapes and\nsizes. It is sometimes combined with the view that propositions\nrepresent states of affairs. It is sometimes defended by friends of\nthe view that facts are obtaining states of affairs (Pf\u00e4nder\n1921), sometimes by friends of the view that facts are neither true\npropositions nor obtaining states of affairs but exemplifications of\nproperties (Armstrong 2004).</p>", "<p>\nBy far the most popular objection to factualist truthmaker maximalism,\nan objection made by both friends and enemies of facts, is that it is\nontologically baroque, that is to say, incredible. The idea that there\nare negative or conditional facts, the objection goes, is incompatible\nwith the demands of metaphysical economy or with the requirements of\nnaturalism. By far the most popular factualist alternative to\nfactualist truthmaker maximalism is the view that all logically atomic\ntruths have truthmakers and that these are formally simple or atomic\nfacts or the view that the only truthmakers which are facts are\nformally simple. Versions of these views are defended by the logical\natomists (see the entry on the\n <a href=\"../truth-correspondence/\">correspondence theory of truth</a>\n and\n <a href=\"#MakiTrue\">section 2.4.2</a>\n below).</p>", "<p>\nAppeals to facts as truthmakers presuppose that there are different\nfacts.

Indeed it is sometimes argued that the\ntheory of truthmaking is a guide to what there is and it is assumed\nthat what there is is just what is ontologically fundamental. The\nassumption may be rejected (see the entry on\n <a href=\"../truthmakers/\">truthmakers</a>).\n Perhaps there are facts but facts are not ontologically fundamental.\n(Compare the claim that there are social entities but that these are\nnot ontologically fundamental.) Then even atomic facts would not be\nontologically fundamental. Perhaps Sam and his concrete state of\nsadness are ontologically fundamental and the fact that Sam is sad is\nnot ontologically fundamental.</p>", "<p>\nWhat might it mean to say that there are facts but they are not\nontologically fundamental? Perhaps that facts or the unity of facts\nare determined by non-facts (Vallicella 2000, Mulligan 2006b).\nPossible candidates for this role are truth-bearers, for example\npropositions, together with what is ontologically fundamental. If\nfacts are not ontologically fundamental, then one objection to\nfactualist truthmaker maximalism misses its mark. According to yet\nanother view, facts are complexes made up of objects and properties\nand those complexes which are facts are less basic than their parts\n(Fine 1982).</p>", "<p>\nAny philosophy of facts owes us an account of the form of such\nexpressions as \u201cthe fact that Sam is sad\u201d (Lowe 1998) and\n\u201cthe state of affairs that Sam is sad\u201d.

Clarke 1975) or that they have no\nproperties (Ingarden 1965). The expression \u201cthe fact that Sam is\nsad\u201d looks like a definite description. What is the form of such\na description?

The proposition that Socrates\nis not a philosopher is made true, on his view, by the fact that the\natomic facts which actually obtain are all the atomic facts there\nare\u2014a totality fact.</p>", "<p>\nThose who are reluctant to admit disjunctive, conjunctive, negative\nand totality facts may wish to adopt the following principle (weaker\nthan P2):</p>", "<ul class=\"sentag tag2em\"> \n\n<li><span class=\"tag\">P3.</span><span class=\"sen\"> \\[\\begin{align*}\\forall p\\in P^{\\circ} \\exists G\\subseteq P(F)\\times P(F) \\cup_{\\langle G,H\\rangle \\in G} (\\CES(G) \\cap(W \\setsub \\DES(H)))\\\\ = \\TS(p).\\end{align*}\\]</span></li>\n\n</ul>", "<p>\nP3 says that the following is true of every proposition <i>p</i> which\ncan be true: for every world where <i>p</i> is true, there are two\nsets of facts <i>G</i> and <i>H</i> such that (i) in <i>w</i>, all\nmembers of <i>G</i> exist and none of <i>H</i> do, and (ii) in every\nworld where this is the case, <i>p</i> is true. That principle is\nrather ugly, but it does what it should do.</p>", "<p>\nP3 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\).\nConsider the following assumptions:</p>", "<ol type=\"1\">\n\n<li>All propositions are Boolean compounds of propositions taken from\na special set, the set of <em>atomic propositions</em>;</li>\n\n<li>To each atomic proposition <i>p</i> corresponds a fact <i>x</i> in\n<i>F</i> such that \\(\\ES(x) = \\TS(p)\\).</li>\n</ol>", "<p>\nA friend of \\(\\textrm{T}_1\\) may be willing to accept\nthem\u2014Wittgenstein (<em>TLP</em>) does\u2014and if he does, he\nwill thereby accept P3.</p>", "<p>\nEven the weak principle P3 faces some difficulties. Consider a true\nuniversal proposition, say the proposition that every finger of my\nright hand is less than 1m long. It seems that unless some\ncontroversial assumptions are made (like Wittgenstein\u2019s view\nthat universal propositions are conjunctions), to countenance P3\ninvolves accepting that there is something like the fact that every\nfinger of my right hand is less than 1m long and claiming that its\nexistence-set is identical to the truth-set of the proposition in\nquestion. Following Wittgenstein (<em>TLP</em>), many reject such\nuniversal facts. In the other camp are e.g., Russell (<em>PLA</em>)\nand Armstrong (1997; Armstrong invokes certain totality facts, which\nhave indeed a universal component.).</p>", "<p>\nThere is an alternative approach which escapes all the previous\ndifficulties. The idea is that facts make true certain basic\npropositions, and the truth-value of the remaining, more complex\npropositions is determined by the basic truths and the particular\ncontent of these propositions. This is the view put forward in\nWittgenstein <em>TLP</em>: the atomic facts make true the true atomic\npropositions, and whether a complex proposition (for him, a Boolean\ncombination of atomic propositions) is completely settled by what\nhappens at the atomic level. Views of that kind are rather attractive,\nsince they tend to favour parsimonious ontologies of facts. But they\nprove especially difficult to develop, especially when special\npropositions are taken into account, e.g., propositions involving\nmodal concepts.</p>", "<p>\nThere is, as we have seen, an issue as to whether facts are complex\nentities or not, and as to how (if at all) the various facts are\ncomposed and as to what composition means here. (This question is not\nalways independent of the question whether propositions are complex.\nThis is obvious if facts are taken to be true propositions. But even\nif the identification is rejected, it may nevertheless be maintained\nthat facts share important features with propositions. On\npropositional complexity, see the entries on\n <a href=\"../propositions-singular/\">singular propositions</a>\n and\n <a href=\"../propositions-structured/\">structured propositions</a>.)</p>", "<p>\nThe view that there is an operation of negation, or conjunction, or\ndisjunction on facts is compatible with the claim that some facts are\ncomplex. For on a natural view, a conjunctive fact is literally\ncomposed by the facts of which it is a conjunction\u2014and similarly\nfor negation and disjunction. (Notice that admitting any two of the\nBoolean operations would then force one to accept that there are\nseveral ways in which the very same facts can combine in order to make\nup a fact.) Acceptance of some Boolean operations on facts is\ncompatible with taking facts to be complex, but it does not entail it:\none may accept, e.g., that a given fact is the conjunction of other\nfacts, and at the same time believe, say, that its depends for its\nidentity on them without having them as <em>parts</em>.</p>", "<p>\nThe issue of the complexity of facts also arises independently of\nissues of Boolean composition. It is a widespread view among the\nfriends of facts that certain facts are complex entities made up of\nobjects and properties or relations, and correspond to certain simple\npredications, at least in the sense that in every world, the\npredication is true if the fact obtains. Call such facts\n<em>substantial facts</em>, and that view <em>Substantialism</em>. We\nmay designate the substantial fact that objects \\(a_1 , \\ldots ,a_n\\)\nstand in relation <i>R</i> (in that order) by \u2018[<i>R</i>; \\(a_1\n, \\ldots ,a_n\\)]\u2019. According to Substantialism, the sentence\n\u2018Socrates is mortal\u2019 corresponds in the previous sense to\na certain fact composed of Socrates and of the property of being\nmortal, namely [being mortal; Socrates], which obtains in a world only\nif in that world, Socrates exemplify the property of being mortal.\n(There may easily be disagreement about this very example, as indeed\nwith any particular example.) Substantialism is a form of what Fine\ncalls \u2018objectualism\u2019 (Fine 1982). Substantialist views are\nput forward in Russell <em>PLA</em>, Suszko 1968, Van Fraassen 1969,\nTaylor 1985, Armstrong 1997, and perhaps Wittgenstein <em>TLP</em>\n(\u2018perhaps\u2019, because it is not clear which kinds of objects\ncompose facts according to him).</p>", "<p>\nThe existence-conditions of a whole often depend upon facts about its\nparts. If there are disjunctive / conjunctive facts which contain the\ncorresponding disjuncts / conjuncts, then any such fact exists in a\nworld iff some disjuncts / all the conjuncts do. And if there is a\nnegative fact containing the corresponding negated item, the former\nfact exists in a world iff the latter does not. These\nexistence-conditions are written into the nature of the Boolean\noperations.</p>", "<p>\nWhen we come to substantial facts, things are not so straightforward.\nA comparison with sets may be useful. There is a view according to\nwhich the existence of a set requires that of its members: in a world\nwhere, say, Socrates exists but not Plato, the set [Socrates, Plato]\ndoes not exist. And there is the more liberal view which says that\nevery set exists necessarily. Corresponding to these two positions are\nthe following two views about facts:</p>", "<ol type=\"a\">\n\n<li>A substantial fact exists in a world iff in that world (i) the\nobjects have that property and (ii) the objects and the property\nexist;</li>\n\n<li>A substantial fact exists in a world iff in that world the objects\nhave that property.</li>\n</ol>", "<p>\nThe two views are identical if no objects can have a property unless\nthe objects and the property exist. Otherwise they are distinct.\nSuppose there is such a thing as the fact [being human; Socrates].\nBoth views can countenance such an object. But for the first the fact\nwill exist only in worlds where Socrates exists, while for the second\nit is sufficient that Socrates has the property of being human. And it\nmay be held that Socrates has the property in all possible worlds,\neven in those where he fails to exist. (Of course, there is a similar\nissue regarding the existence-conditions of facts across times.)</p>", "<p>\nIt is clear that this divergence potentially has dramatic consequences\nfor one\u2019s conception of the relationships between facts and\npropositions. Take for granted that it is necessary that Socrates is\nhuman, and that Socrates only contingently exists. Then a proponent of\nview (b), but not a proponent of view (a), can claim that the\nproposition that Socrates is human is true in a world iff [being\nhuman; Socrates] exists in that world.</p>", "<p>\nA substantialist may either deny or accept that there is an operation\nof conjunction on facts. If he accepts it, he will presumably view\nconjunctions of substantial facts as themselves complex entities (the\nopposite view would be very odd), doubly complex indeed, having a\nconjunctive structure and the conjuncts in turn having their own\ninternal composition. Similar considerations hold of disjunction and\nnegation.</p>", "<p>\nProponents of (a) are likely to deny that there is an operation of\nnegation on facts. For take the fact [being a philosopher; Socrates],\nand suppose there is a corresponding negation <i>x</i>. Then as we\nsaw, it would be odd to claim that <i>x</i> is not a complex fact,\nhaving Socrates as a component. Suppose <i>x</i> has such a\ncomplexity. Now take two worlds <i>w</i> and <i>v</i>, such that in\n<i>w</i> Socrates exists but is not a philosopher, and in <i>v</i>,\nSocrates does not exist (and so is not a philosopher either). Then in\nboth worlds, the proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher is\ntrue. And according to a proponent of view (a), <i>x</i> exists in\n<i>w</i> but not in <i>v</i>. The outcome is rather odd. Similar\nconsiderations hold of disjunction, but not of conjunction.</p>", "<p>\nSo far we have considered two types of complexity facts may have:\nBoolean complexity (which in turn divides into the various types\ncorresponding to the various Boolean operations) and the complexity of\nsubstantial facts. But there are many other types of complexity one\nmay take facts to have. Think of universal facts (the fact that all\nmen have a brain), modal facts (the fact that it is possible that\nSocrates is a football player), and so on.</p>", "<p>\nThe identity-conditions of a whole often depends upon facts about its\nparts. When are two substantial facts \\([R; a, b]\\) and \\([S; c, d]\\)\nidentical? A plausible answer is: when \\(R = S, a = c\\) and \\(b = d\\).\nThis answer has consequences for a friend of <em>Modal Criterion</em>.\nAccepting both the proposed identity-condition and <em>Modal\nCriterion</em>, one cannot claim that there are distinct but\nnecessarily coextensive properties (which are part of some facts), or\nthat the facts [being human; Socrates] and [having a human member;\n[Socrates]] are distinct, even on the plausible assumption that they\nexist in the very same worlds.</p>"], "tags": ["plato.stanford.edu", "facts"]}
