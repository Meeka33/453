 Can one base our understanding of what states of affairs are on features of how we talk about them? Pollock holds that we normally refer to states of affairs by gerund clauses such as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s being more than seven feet tall or Spiro Agnew’s being President of Yale University (see Pollock 1984b: 121). However, while the referents of such gerund clauses seem not to be propositions—“Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s being more than seven feet tall is true” does not sound right—these clauses are referentially flexible. For the gerund clauses in the following sentences seem to refer to facts or events, the relata of causal relations and objects of knowledge (the first two examples are from Pollock 1984b: 122): Now facts may be nothing but states of affairs that obtain and events states of affairs that obtain at some times and not at others. If this were right, the gerund clauses above would refer to states of affairs. But we need to get an independent grip on the notion of states of affairs before settling the question whether facts and events are a kind of state of affairs. For this purpose we can neither pick out states of affairs as the things that obtain or nor say that they are the referents of gerund clauses of the kind considered above. Are there predicates that we apply to state of affairs and that are distinctive of them? States of affairs are said to obtain or not, while Fregean thoughts are true are false. In contrast, facts exist; a fact cannot be qualified as obtaining or not obtaining (see Betti 2015: 35). However, it seems difficult to get a grip on the difference between obtaining and non-obtaining on the one hand, and truth and falsity on the other. Prima facie, the state of affairs Socrates’s being wise obtains if, and only if, it is true that Socrates is wise (see Plantinga 1974: 45–6; see also Betti 2015: 35). Pollock (1984a: 53) correctly observes that “obtaining and not-obtaining are truth-like properties”. But why are they just truth-like and not just truth and falsity under a different label; why can the obtaining of a state of affairs not be identified with the truth of a thought or proposition? Betti proposes that the distinction between obtaining and non-obtaining states of affairs is an ontological one: nonobtaining states of affairs have no mode of being (so they neither subsist nor exist) but they are still objects in their own right—that is, they are part of the catalogue of the world in their own right. (2015: 35–6) If this were right, states of affairs would be more even puzzling than Meinongian objects that at least subsist. However, false propositions seem equally to have only a “shadowy” existence: Time was when I thought there were propositions, but it does not seem to me very plausible to say that in addition to facts there are also these curious shadowy things going about such as “That today is Wednesday” when in fact it is Tuesday. (Russell 1918: 223) In conclusion: the difference between “is true (false)” and “obtains (does not obtain)”, does not help us to distinguish states of affairs from other things. Is there a theoretical role that states of affairs can, but thoughts (propositions) and facts can’t fill? In order to answer this question, consider a school exercise in probability (see Kripke 1980: 16). Take two ordinary dice, \(D_{1}\) and \(D_{2}\), with six sides each. For each die, there are six possible outcomes of a throw. \(D_{1}\) and \(D_{2}\) are thrown and, on landing, display two numbers. Hence, there are thirty-six possible outcomes of throwing the dice. Let us now calculate the probability that the outcome of throwing the two dice is 11. There are only two outcomes of throwing the two dice in which they show together 11: either (i) \(D_{1}\) shows 5 and \(D_{2}\) 6 or (ii) \(D_{1}\) shows 6 and \(D_{2}\) 5. The probability of the outcome of \(D_{1}\)’s and \(D_{2}\)’s jointly showing 11 is the ratio between all possible outcomes of \(D_{1}\)’s and \(D_{2}\)’s jointly showing 11 and the totality of possible outcomes of throwing the two dice: 2/36 = 1/18. In the calculations we assumed (1): We also assumed that there is a space of possible states of the dice; ways the two dice might fall. A way the dice might fall exists even if it is not true that the dice have fallen that way: The possible states are possible states of objects. \(D_{1}\)’s and \(D_{2}\)’s Showing 5 is a possible state of the dice, however we describe them or ascribe the property. This suggests (3): The possible states involved in our exercise have the properties philosophers take states of affairs to have. States of affairs are probable to a degree or possible, as stressed by Reinach (1911: 339–40; Künne 1987: 185ff and Forbes 1989: 131 follow Reinach). They are supposed to exist without obtaining (2) and to have objects and properties as constituents (3). (2) distinguishes states of affairs from facts. The fact that Socrates is wise exists, if, and only if, Socrates is wise. If Socrates is not wise, there is no fact of him being wise. Hence, the fact that Socrates is wise cannot be a mere possibility for Socrates; it can, so to speak, only be an actuality. In contrast, the state of affairs that Socrates is foolish exists, even if Socrates is not foolish (see Reinach 1911; Wittgenstein 1918: 2.04, 2.05; Plantinga 1974: 44; Pollock 1984a: 52). (3) distinguishes states of affairs from thoughts: [States of affairs] are “about” objects but not in terms of some mode of representation. States of affairs, in some sense, contain objects as direct constituents. (Pollock 1984a: 53) The state of affairs Marilyn Monroe’s being an actress and the state of affairs Norma Jean Baker’s being an actress, contain, in some sense, the same objects and properties as constituents in the same order. They are the same state of affairs under different names. However, I can believe that Marilyn Monroe is an actress while doubting that Norma Jean Baker is an actress. Hence, if there are states of affairs, they are not the content of propositional attitudes like belief; thoughts are. This point leaves open the possibility that a state of affairs is a set of thoughts that are equivalent in some respect (see  section 2.2). The model of a space of possible outcomes of a throw of a die gives us an initial idea of what the distinctive properties of state of affairs are and why it is plausible to assume that there are any states of affairs. It leaves questions about the precise nature of states of affairs open. For example, Wittgenstein (1918: 4.26) argued that only elementary sentences “picture” states of affairs. An elementary sentence in Wittgenstein’s sense is a concatenation of simple proper names each of which refers to a simple object. The names in the elementary proposition are arranged in a way that can be mapped onto an arrangement of the simple objects named. This arrangement of objects is the state of affairs pictured by the elementary sentence. Nothing said so far rules out that states of affairs that involve some objects and properties (relations) combine to form further complex states of affairs that have states of affairs as constituents. (Pollock 1984a: 55–6) defines negation, conjunction etc. for states of affairs. For example, if there is a state of affairs \(S_1\) and a state of affairs \(S_2\), their conjunction is the state of affairs that obtains if, and only if, both \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) obtain. If one wants to restrict the space of possible states to combinations of simple objects, one needs to marshal arguments that show that this and similar conceptions of complex states of affairs is flawed. (This entry is mainly concerned with simple states of affairs.) Similarly, the model of states of affairs as possible outcomes does not rule out that there are impossible state of affairs. If there is a space of possible states of the dice, there seems to be a space of impossible states of them as well. For example, it is impossible for the dice to show 17 or no number at all (see Rumfitt 2015: 187f for a brief discussion of impossible states of affairs).
