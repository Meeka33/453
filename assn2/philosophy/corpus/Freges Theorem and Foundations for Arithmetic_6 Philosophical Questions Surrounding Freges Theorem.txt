 As we've now seen, the proof of Frege’s Theorem can be carried out independently of the portion of Frege’s system which led to inconsistency. Frege himself never identified “Frege’s Theorem” as a “result”. As previously noted, he attempted to derive Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V in Gg, but once the contradiction became known to him, he never officially retreated to the ‘fall-back’ position of claiming that the proof of the Dedekind-Peano axioms from Hume’s Principle alone constituted an important result. One of several reasons why he didn’t adopt this fall-back position is that he didn’t regard Hume’s Principle as a sufficiently general principle – he didn’t believe it was strong enough, from an epistemological point of view, to help us answer the question, “How are numbers given to us?”. We discuss the thinking behind this attitude, and other things, in what follows. A discussion of the philosophical questions surrounding Frege’s Theorem should begin with some statement of how Frege conceived of his own project when writing Begr, Gl, and Gg. It seems clear that epistemological considerations in part motivated Frege’s work on the foundations of mathematics. It is well documented that Frege had the following goal, namely, to explain our knowledge of the basic laws of arithmetic by giving an answer to the question “How are numbers ‘given’ to us?” without making an appeal to the faculty of intuition. If Frege could show that the basic laws of number theory are derivable from analytic truths of logic, then he could argue that we need only appeal to the faculty of understanding (as opposed to some faculty of intuition) to explain our knowledge of the truths of arithmetic. Frege’s goal then stands in contrast to the Kantian view of the exact mathematical sciences, according to which general principles of reasoning must be supplemented by a faculty of intuition if we are to achieve mathematical knowledge. The Kantian model here is that of geometry; Kant thought that our intuitions of figures and constructions played an essential role in the demonstrations of geometrical theorems. (In Frege’s own time, the achievements of Frege’s contemporaries Pasch, Pieri and Hilbert showed that such intuitions were not essential.) Frege’s strategy then was to show that no appeal to intuition is required for the derivation of the theorems of number theory. This in turn required that he show that the latter are derivable using only rules of inference, axioms, and definitions that are purely analytic principles of logic. This view has become known as ‘Logicism’. Here is what Frege says: [Begr, Preface, p. 5:]  To prevent anything intuitive from penetrating here unnoticed, I had to bend every effort to keep the chain of inferences free of gaps. [from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort 1967] [Begr, Part III, §23:]  Through the present example, moreover, we see how pure thought, irrespective of any content given by the senses or even by an intuition a priori, can, solely from the content that results from its own constitution, bring forth judgements that at first sight appear to be possible only on the basis of some intuition. \(\ldots\) The propositions about sequences [\(R\)-series] in what follows far surpass in generality all those that can be derived from any intuition of sequences. [from the Bauer-Mengelberg translation in van Heijenoort 1967] [Gl, §62:]  How, then, are numbers to be given to us, if we cannot have any ideas or intuitions of them? Since it is only in the context of a proposition that words have any meaning, our problem becomes this: To define the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1974] [Gl, §87:]  I hope I may claim in the present work to have made it probable that the laws of arithmetic are analytic judgements and consequently a priori. Arithmetic thus becomes simply a development of logic, and every proposition of arithmetic a law of logic, albeit a derivative one. [from the Austin translation in Frege 1974] [Gg I, §0:]  In my Grundlagen der Arithmetik, I sought to make it plausible that arithmetic is a branch of logic and need not borrow any ground of proof whatever from either experience or intuition. In the present book, this shall be confirmed, by the derivation of the simplest laws of Numbers by logical means alone. [from the Furth translation in Frege 1967] [Gg II, Appendix:]  The prime problem of arithmetic is the question, In what way are we to conceive logical objects, in particular, numbers? By what means are we justified in recognizing numbers as objects? Even if this problem is not solved to the degree I thought it was when I wrote this volume, still I do not doubt that the way to the solution has been found. [from the Furth translation in Frege 1967] The basic problem for Frege’s strategy, however, is that for his logicist project to succeed, his system must at some point include (either as an axiom or theorem) statements that explicitly assert the existence of certain kinds of abstract entities and it is not obvious how to justify the claim that we know such explicit existential statements. Given the above discussion, it should be clear that Frege at some point in Gg endorsed existence claims, either directly in his formalism or in his metalanguage, for the following entities: Although Frege attempted to reduce the latter two kinds of entities (truth-values and numbers) to extensions, the fact is that the existence of concepts and extensions are derivable from his Rule of Substitution and Basic Law V, respectively. In light of these existence claims, a Kantian might well suggest not only that explicit existence claims are synthetic rather than analytic (i.e., aren’t true in virtue of the meanings of the words involved) but also that since the Rule of Substitution and Basic Law V imply existence claims, Frege cannot claim that such principles are purely analytic principles of logic. If the Kantian is right, then some other faculty (such as intuition) might still be needed to account for our knowledge of the existence claims of arithmetic. Boolos (1985) noted that the Rule of Substitution causes a problem of this kind for Frege’s program given that it is equivalent the Comprehension Principle for Concepts. Boolos suggests a defense for Frege with respect to this particular aspect of his logic, namely, to reinterpret (by paraphrasing) the second-order quantifiers so as to avoid commitment to concepts. (See Boolos (1985) for the details.) Boolos’s suggestion, however, is one which would require Frege to abandon his realist theory of concepts. Moreover, although Boolos’s suggestion might lead us to an epistemological justification of the Comprehension Principle for Concepts, it doesn’t do the same for the Comprehension Principle for Relations, for his reinterpretation of the quantifiers works only for the ‘monadic’ quantifiers (i.e., those ranging over concepts having one argument) and thus doesn’t offer a paraphrase for quantification over relational concepts. Another problem for a strategy of the type suggested by Boolos is that if the second-order quantifiers are interpreted so that they do not range over a separate domain of entities, then there is nothing appropriate to serve as the denotations of \(\lambda\)-expressions. Although Frege wouldn’t quite put it this way, our reconstruction suggests that Frege treats open formulas with free object variables as if they denoted concepts. Although Frege doesn’t use \(\lambda\)-notation, the use of such notation seems to be the most logically perspicuous way of reconstructing his work. The use of such notation faces the same epistemological puzzles that Frege’s Rule of Substitution faces. To see why, note that the Principle of \(\lambda\)-Conversion: \(\forall y([\lambda x\, \phi ]y \equiv \phi^y_x)\) seems to be an analytic truth of logic. It says this: An object \(y\) exemplifies the complex property being such that \(\phi\) if and only if \(y\) is such that \(\phi\). One might argue that this is true in virtue of the very meaning of the \(\lambda\)-expression, the meaning of \(\equiv\), and the meaning of the statement \([\lambda x\, \phi]y\) (which has the form \( Fx)\). However, \(\lambda\)-Conversion also implies the Comprehension Principle for Concepts, for the latter follows from the former by existential generalization: \(\exists F\forall y(Fy \equiv \phi^y_x)\) The point here is that the fact that an existential claim is derivable casts at least some doubt on the purely analytic status of \(\lambda\)-Conversion. The question of how we obtain knowledge of such principles is still an open question in philosophy. It is an important question to address, since Frege’s most insightful definitions are cast using quantifiers ranging over concepts and relations (e.g., the ancestrals of a relation) and it would be useful to have a philosophical explanation of how such entities and the principles which govern them become known to us. In contemporary philosophy, this question is still poignant, since many philosophers do accept that properties and relations of various sorts exist. These entities are the contemporary analogues of Frege’s concepts. Though the existence of extensions falls right out of the theory of identity (§2.3) once terms of the form \(\epsilon F\) are added to second-order logic, the existence of extensions that are correlated one-to-one with concepts is a consequence of Basic Law V. The question for Frege’s project, then, is why should we accept as a law of logic a statement that implies the existence of individuals and a correlation of this kind? Frege recognized that Basic Law V’s status as a logical law could be doubted: Moreover, he thought that an appeal to extensions would answer one of the questions that motivated his work: Now it is unclear why Frege thought that he could answer the question posed here by saying that we apprehend numbers as the extensions of concepts. He seems to think we can answer the obvious next question “How do we apprehend extensions?” by saying “by way of Basic Law V”.   His idea here seems to be that since Basic Law V is supposed to be purely analytic or true in virtue of the meanings of its terms, we apprehend a pair of extensions whenever we truly judge that concepts \(F\) and \(G\) are materially equivalent. Some philosophers do argue that certain consistent principles having the same logical form as Basic Law V are analytic, and that such principles justify reference to the entities described in the left-side condition by grounding such reference in the truth of the right-side  condition.[14] Why did Frege think that Basic Law V is analytic and that the material equivalence of concepts \(F\) and \(G\) is analytically equivalent to an identity that implies the existence of extensions? To hold that Basic Law V is analytic, it seems that one must hold that the right-side condition implies the corresponding left-side condition as a matter of  meaning.[15]  This view, however, can be questioned. Suppose the right hand condition implies the left-side condition as a matter of meaning. That is, suppose that (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning: Now note that (L) itself can be analyzed, from a logical point of view. The expression ‘\(\epsilon F\)’, though constructed from a term-forming operator, is really a definite description (‘the extension of \(F\)’) and so, using Russell’s theory of descriptions, (L) can be logically analyzed as the claim: There is an object \(x\) and an object \(y\) such that:  (1) \(x\) is a unique extension of \(F\),  (2) \(y\) is a unique extension of \(G\), and  (3) \(x = y\). That is, for some defined or primitive notion \(\mathit{Extension}(x,F)\) (‘\(x\) is an extension of \(F\)’), (L) implies the analysis (D) as a matter of meaning: But if (R) implies (L) as a matter of meaning, and (L) implies (D) as a matter of meaning, then (R) implies (D) as a matter of meaning. This conclusion can be questioned: why should the material equivalence of \(F\) and \(G\) imply the existence claim (D) as a matter of meaning? In other words, the suggestion that Va (i.e., the right-to-left direction of Basic Law V) is analytic leads to a question that has no obvious answer. Below, this line of reasoning will be adapted to question the analyticity of the right-to-left direction of Hume’s Principle. See Boolos 1997 (307–309), for reasons why \(Vb\) (the left-to-right direction of Hume’s Principle) is not analytic.] The moral to be drawn here is that, even if Basic Law V were consistent, it is not exactly clear how its right side analytically implies the existence of extensions. In the end, we may need some other way of justifying our knowledge of principles like Basic Law V, that imply the existence of abstract objects – the justification discussed so far seems to contain a gap. Even if we follow Frege in conceiving of extensions as ‘logical objects’, the question remains: how can the claims that such objects exist be true on logical or analytic grounds alone? We might agree that there must be logical objects of some sort if logic is to have a subject matter, but if Frege is to achieve his goal of showing that our knowledge of arithmetic is free of intuition, then at some point he has to address the question of how we can know that numbers exist. We’ll return to this issue in the final subsection. Given that the proof of Frege’s Theorem makes no appeal to Basic Law V, some philosophers have argued Frege’s best strategy for producing an epistemologically-justified foundation for arithmetic is to replace the primitive term \(\epsilon F\) with the primitive term \(\#F\), replace Basic Law V with Hume’s Principle, and argue that Hume’s Principle is an analytic principle of  logic.[16]  However, we have just seen one reason why such a strategy does not suffice. The claim that Hume’s Principle is an analytic principle of logic is subject to the same problem just posed for Basic Law V. A reason must be given as to why the claim: \(F \approx G\) implies, as a matter of meaning, that: \(\#F = \#G\) After all, the statement “\(\#F = \#G\)” is analyzable in a manner analogous to the way we analyzed “\(\epsilon F = \epsilon G\)” in the previous section, where we used Russell’s theory of description to analyze the sentence (L) as the sentence (D). Following that pattern, we take the primitive notion \(\mathit{Numbers}(x,F)\) and analyze \(\#F = \#G\) as: It is not clear why we should think that this last claim is implied by \(F \approx G\) as a matter of meaning. The right-to-left direction of Hume’s Principle is not obviously analytic. Moreover, Frege had his own reasons for not replacing Basic Law V with Hume’s Principle. One reason was that he thought Hume’s Principle offered no answer to the epistemological question, ‘How do we grasp or apprehend logical objects, such as the numbers?’. A second reason is that Hume’s Principle is clearly subject to ‘the Julius Caesar problem’. Frege first raises this problem in connection with an inductive definition of ‘\(n = \#F\)’ that he tries out in Gl, §55. Concerning this definition, Frege says: Frege raises this same concern again for a contextual definition that gives a ‘criterion of identity’ for the objects being defined. In Gl §66, Frege considers the following contextual definition of ‘the direction of line \(x\)’: With regard to this definition, Frege says: Now trouble for Hume’s Principle begins to arise when we recognize that it is a contextual definition that has the same logical form as this definition for directions. It is central to Frege’s view that the numbers are objects, and so he believes that it is incumbent upon him to say which objects they are. But the ‘Julius Caesar problem’ is that Hume’s Principle, if considered as the sole principle offering identity conditions for numbers, doesn’t describe the conditions under which an arbitrary object, say Julius Caesar, is or is not to be identified with the number of planets. That is, Hume’s Principle doesn’t define the condition ‘\(\#F = x\)’, for arbitrary \(x\). It only offers identity conditions when \(x\) is an object known to be a cardinal number (for then \(x = \#G\), for some \(G\), and Hume’s Principle tells us when \(\#F = \#G\)). In Gl, Frege solves the problem by giving his explicit definition of numbers in terms of extensions. (We described this in §4 above.) Unfortunately, this is only a stopgap measure, for when Frege later systematizes extensions in Gg, Basic Law V has the same logical form as Hume’s Principle and the above contextual definition of directions. Frege is aware that the Julius Caesar problem affects Basic Law V, as the discussion in Gg I, §10 shows. In that section, he says (remembering that for Frege, \(\epsilon\) binds object variables and is not a function term): In other words, Basic Law V does not tell us the conditions under which an arbitrarily chosen object \(x\) may be identified with some given extension, such as \(\epsilon F\). Until recently, it was thought that Frege solved this problem in §10 by restricting the universal quantifier \(\forall x\) of his Gg system so that it ranges only over extensions. If Frege could have successfully restricted this quantifier to extensions, then when the question arises, whether (arbitrarily chosen) object \(x\) is identical with \(\epsilon F\), one could answer that \(x\) has to be the extension of some concept, say \( G\), and that Basic Law V would then tell you the conditions under which \(x\) is identical to \(\epsilon F\). On this interpretation of §10, Frege is alleged to have restricted the quantifiers when he identified the two truth values (The True and The False) with the two extensions that contain just these objects as members, respectively. By doing this, it was thought that all of the objects in the range of his quantifier \(\forall x\) in Gg become extensions which have been identified as such, for the truth values were the only two objects of his system that had not been introduced as extensions or courses of value. However, recent work by Wehmeier (1999) suggests that, in §10, Frege was not attempting to restrict the quantifiers of his system to extensions (nor, more generally, to courses-of-values). The extensive footnote to §10 indicates that Frege considered, but did not hold much hope of, identifying every object in the domain with the extension consisting of just that  object.[17]  But, more importantly, Frege later considers cases (in Gg, Sections 34 and 35) which seem to presuppose that the domain contains objects which aren’t extensions. (In these sections, Frege considers what happens to the definition of ‘\( x\) is a member of \(y\)’ when \(y\) is not an  extension.)[18] Even if Frege somehow could have successfully restricted the quantifiers of Gg to avoid the Julius Caesar problem, he would no longer have been able to apply his system by extending it to include names of ordinary non-logical objects. For if he were to attempt to do so, the question, “Under what conditions is \(\epsilon F\) identical with Julius Caesar?”, would then be legitimate but have no answer. That means his logical system could not be used for the analysis of ordinary language. But it was just the analysis of ordinary language that led Frege to his insight that a statement of number is an assertion about a concept. Even when we replace the inconsistent Basic Law V with the powerful Hume’s Principle, Frege’s work still leaves two questions unanswered: (1) How do we know that numbers exist?, and (2) How do we precisely specify which objects they are? The first question arises because Hume’s Principle doesn’t seem to be a purely analytic truth of logic; if neither Hume’s Principle nor the existential claim that numbers exist is analytically true, by what faculty do we come to know (the truth of) the existential claim? The second question arises because the Julius Caesar problem applies to Hume's Principle; without a solution to that problem, Frege can't claim to have precisely specified which objects the numbers are, so as to delineate them within the domain of all logical and non-logical objects? So questions about the very existence and identity of numbers still affect Frege’s work. These two questions arise because of a limitation in the logical form of these Fregean biconditional principles such as Hume’s Principle and Basic Law V. These contextual definitions combine two jobs which modern logicians now typically accomplish with separate principles. A properly reformulated theory of ‘logical’ objects should have separate principles: (1) one or more principles which assert the existence of logical objects, and (2) a separate identity principle which asserts the conditions under which logical objects are identical. The latter should specify identity conditions for logical objects in terms of their most salient characteristic, one which distinguishes them from other objects. Such an identity principle would then be more specific than the global identity principle for all objects (Leibniz’s Law) which asserts that if objects \(x\) and \(y\) fall under the same concepts, they are identical. By way of example, consider modern set theory. Zermelo set theory \( (Z)\) has several distinctive set existence principles. For example, consider the well-known Subset (or Separation) Axiom: Subset (Separation) Axiom of Z:  \(\forall x[\mathit{Set}(x) \to \exists y[\mathit{Set}(y) \amp \forall z(z \in y \equiv (z \in x \amp \phi))]]\),  where \(\phi\) is any formula in which \(y\) isn’t free The Subset Axiom and the other set existence axioms in Z are distinct from Z’s identity principle for sets: Identity Principle for Sets:  \(\mathit{Set}(x) \amp \mathit{Set}(y) \to [\forall z(z \in x \equiv z \in y) \to x\eqclose y]\) Note that the second principle offers identity conditions in terms of the most salient features of sets, namely, the fact that they, unlike other objects, have members. The identity conditions for objects which aren’t sets, then, can be the standard principle that identifies objects whenever they fall under the same concepts. This leads us naturally to a very general principle of identity for any objects whatever: Now, if something is given to us as a set and we ask whether it is identical with an arbitrarily chosen object \(x\), this specifies a clear condition that settles the matter. The only questions that remain for the theory \(Z\) concern its existence principle: Do we know that the Subset Axiom and other set existence principles are true, and if so, how? The question of existence is thus laid bare. We do not approach it by attempting to justify a principle that implies the existence of sets via definite descriptions which we don’t yet know to be well-defined. In some classic essays (1987 and 1986), Boolos appears to recommend this very procedure of using separate existence and identity principles. In those essays, he eschews the primitive mathematical relation of set membership and suggests that Frege could formulate his theory of numbers (‘Frege Arithmetic’) by using a single nonlogical comprehension axiom which employs a special instantiation relation that holds between a concept \(G\) and an object \(x\) whenever, intuitively, \(x\) is an extension consisting solely of concepts and \(G\) is a concept ‘in’ \(x\). He calls this nonlogical axiom ‘Numbers’ and uses the notation ‘\(Gηx\)’ to signify that \(G\) is in \(x\): Numbers:  \(\forall F\exists !x\forall G(Gηx \equiv G\approx F)\) [See Boolos 1987 (5), 1986 (140).] This principle asserts that for any concept \(F\), there is a unique object which contains in it all and only those concepts \(G\) which are equinumerous to \(F\). Boolos then makes two observations: (1) Frege can then define \(\#F\) as “the unique object \(x\) such that for all concepts \(G\), \(G\) is in \(x\) iff \(G\) is equinumerous to \(F\)”, and (2) Hume’s Principle is derivable from Numbers. [See Boolos 1986 (140).] Given these observations, we know from our work in §§4 and 5 above that Numbers suffices for the derivation of the basic laws of arithmetic. Since Boolos calls this principle ‘Numbers’, it is no stretch to suppose that he would accept the following reformulation (in which ‘\(\mathit{Number}(x)\)’ is an undefined, primitive notion): Numbers:  \(\forall F\exists !x [\mathit{Number}(x) \amp \forall G(Gηx \equiv G\approx F)]\) Though Boolos doesn’t explicitly formulate an identity principle to complement Numbers, it seems clear that the following principle would offer identity conditions in terms of the most distinctive feature of numbers: Identity Principle for Numbers:  \(\mathit{Number}(x) \amp \mathit{Number}(y) \to [\forall G(Gηx \equiv Gηy) \to x\eqclose y]\) It is then straightforward to formulate a general principle of identity, as we did in the case of the set theory \(Z\): This formulation of Frege Arithmetic, in terms of Numbers and the General Principle of Identity, puts the Julius Caesar problem (described above) into better perspective; the condition ‘\(\#F = x\)’ is defined for arbitrary concepts \(F\) and objects \(x\). It openly faces the epistemological questions head-on: Do we know that Numbers is true, and if so, how? This is where philosophers need to concentrate their energies. [For a reconstruction of Frege Arithmetic with a more general version of the special instantiation relation η, see Zalta 1999.] By replacing Fregean biconditionals such as Hume’s Principle with separate existence and identity principles, we reduce two problems to one and and isolate the real problem for Fregean foundations of arithmetic, namely, the problem of giving an epistemological justification for distinctive existence claims (e.g., Numbers) for abstract objects of a certain kind. For if anything like Frege’s program is to succeed, it must at some point assert (as an axiom or theorem) the existence of (logical) objects of some kind. Those separate existence claims should be the focus of attention.
