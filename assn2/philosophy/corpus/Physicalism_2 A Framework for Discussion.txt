 In approaching the topic of physicalism, one may distinguish what I will call the interpretation question from the truth question. The interpretation question asks: The truth question asks: There is obviously a sense in which the second question presupposes an answer to the first — you need to know what a statement means before you can ask whether it's true — and we will begin with the interpretation question. Nevertheless, the issues here turn out to be somewhat technical, and those new to the topic might like to read only the first section of our discussion of the interpretation question, which is:  Supervenience Physicalism: Introductory,  and then turn directly to the truth question which begins at  The Case Against Physicalism I: Qualia and Consciousness. The interpretation question itself divides into two sub-questions, which I will call the completeness question and the condition question. The completeness question asks: In other words, the completeness question holds fixed the issue of what it means for something to satisfy the condition of being physical, and asks instead what it means for everything to satisfy that condition. Notice that a parallel question could be asked of Thales: assuming we know what condition you have to satisfy to be water, what does it mean to say that everything satisfies that condition? The condition question asks: In other words, the condition question holds fixed the issue of what it means for everything to satisfy some condition or other, and asks instead what is the condition, being physical, that everything satisfies. Notice again that a parallel question could be asked of Thales: assuming we know what it is for everything to satisfy some condition or other, what is the condition, being water, that according to Thales, everything satisfies? In discussing the interpretation question, I will turn first to the completeness question, and then consider the condition question.
