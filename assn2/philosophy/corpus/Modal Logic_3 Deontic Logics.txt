 Deontic logics introduce the primitive symbol \(O\) for ‘it is obligatory that’, from which symbols \(P\) for ‘it is permitted that’ and \(F\) for ‘it is forbidden that’ are defined: \(PA = {\sim}O{\sim}A\) and \(FA = O{\sim}A\). The deontic analog of the modal axiom \((M): OA\rightarrow A\) is clearly not appropriate for deontic logic. (Unfortunately, what ought to be is not always the case.) However, a basic system \(\mathbf{D}\) of deontic logic can be constructed by adding the weaker axiom \((D)\) to \(\bK\). Axiom \((D)\) guarantees the consistency of the system of obligations by insisting that when \(A\) is obligatory, \(A\) is permissible. A system which obligates us to bring about \(A\), but doesn’t permit us to do so, puts us in an inescapable bind. Although some will argue that such conflicts of obligation are at least possible, most deontic logicians accept \((D)\). \(O(OA\rightarrow A)\) is another deontic axiom that seems desirable. Although it is wrong to say that if \(A\) is obligatory then \(A\) is the case \((OA\rightarrow A)\), still, this conditional ought to be the case. So some deontic logicians believe that \(D\) needs to be supplemented with \(O(OA\rightarrow A)\) as well. Controversy about iteration (repetition) of operators arises again in deontic logic. In some conceptions of obligation, \(OOA\) just amounts to \(OA\). ‘It ought to be that it ought to be’ is treated as a sort of stuttering; the extra ‘ought’s do not add anything new. So axioms are added to guarantee the equivalence of \(OOA\) and \(OA\). The more general iteration policy embodied in \(\mathbf{S5}\) may also be adopted. However, there are conceptions of obligation where distinction between \(OA\) and \(OOA\) is preserved. The idea is that there are genuine differences between the obligations we actually have and the obligations we should adopt. So, for example, ‘it ought to be that it ought to be that \(A\)’ commands adoption of some obligation which may not actually be in place, with the result that \(OOA\) can be true even when \(OA\) is false.
