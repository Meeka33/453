 The literature offers many arguments for LOTH. This section introduces four influential arguments, each of which supports LOTH abductively by citing its explanatory benefits.  Section 5  discusses some prominent objections to the four arguments. Fodor (1975) defends RTT+COMP+CCTM by appealing to scientific practice: our best cognitive science postulates Turing-style mental computations over Mentalese expressions; therefore, we should accept that mental computation operates over Mentalese expressions. Fodor develops his argument by examining detailed case studies, including perception, decision-making, and linguistic comprehension. He argues that, in each case, computation over mental representations plays a central explanatory role. Fodor’s argument was widely heralded as a compelling analysis of then-current cognitive science. When evaluating cognitive science support for LOTH, it is crucial to specify what version of LOTH one has in mind. Specifically, establishing that certain mental processes operate over mental representations is not enough to establish RTT. For example, one might accept that mental representations figure in perception and animal navigation but not in high-level human cognition. Gallistel and King (2009) defend COMP+CCTM+FSC through a number of (mainly non-human) empirical case studies, but they do not endorse RTT. They focus on relatively low-level phenomena, such as animal navigation, without discussing human decision-making, deductive inference, problem solving, or other high-level cognitive phenomena. During your lifetime, you will only entertain a finite number of thoughts. In principle, though, there are infinitely many thoughts you might entertain. Consider: Mary gave the test tube to John’s daughter. Mary gave the test tube to John’s daughter’s daughter. Mary gave the test tube to John’s daughter’s daughter’s daughter. ⋮ The moral usually drawn is that you have the competence to entertain a potential infinity of thoughts, even though your performance is bounded by biological limits upon memory, attention, processing capacity, and so on. In a slogan: thought is productive. RTT+COMP straightforwardly explains productivity. We postulate a finite base of primitive Mentalese symbols, along with operations for combining simple expressions into complex expressions. Iterative application of the compounding operations generates an infinite array of mental sentences, each in principle within your cognitive repertoire. By tokening a mental sentence, you entertain the thought expressed by it. This explanation leverages the recursive nature of compositional mechanisms to generate infinitely many expressions from a finite base. It thereby illuminates how finite creatures such as ourselves are able to entertain a potential infinity of thoughts. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) argue that, since RTT+COMP provides a satisfying explanation for productivity, we have good reason to accept RTT+COMP. A potential worry about this argument is that it rests upon an infinitary competence never manifested within actual performance. One might dismiss the supposed infinitary competence as an idealization that, while perhaps convenient for certain purposes, does not stand in need of explanation. There are systematic interrelations among the thoughts a thinker can entertain. For example, if you can entertain the thought that John loves Mary, then you can also entertain the thought that Mary loves John. Systematicity looks like a crucial property of human thought and so demands a principled explanation. RTT+COMP gives a compelling explanation. According to RTT+COMP, your ability to entertain the thought that p hinges upon your ability to bear appropriate psychological relations to a Mentalese sentence S whose meaning is that p. If you are able to think that John loves Mary, then your internal system of mental representations includes a mental sentence John loves Mary, composed of mental words John, loves, and Mary combined in the right way. If you have the capacity to stand in psychological relation A* to John loves Mary, then you also have the capacity to stand in relation A* to a distinct mental sentence Mary loves John. The constituent words John, loves, and Mary make the same semantic contribution to both mental sentences (John denotes John, loves denotes the loving relation, and Mary denotes Mary), but the words are arranged in different constituency structures so that the sentences have different meanings. Whereas John loves Mary means that John loves Mary, Mary loves John means that Mary loves John. By standing in relation A* to the sentence Mary loves John, you entertain the thought that Mary loves John. Thus, an ability to think that John loves Mary entails an ability to think that John loves Mary. By comparison, an ability to think that John loves Mary does not entail an ability to think that whales are mammals or an ability to think that \(56 + 138 = 194\). Fodor (1987: 148–153) supports RTT+COMP by citing its ability to explain systematicity. In contrast with the productivity argument, the systematicity argument does not depend upon infinitary idealizations that outstrip finite performance. Note that neither argument provides any direct support for CTM. Neither argument even mentions computation. There are systematic interrelations among which inferences a thinker can draw. For example, if you can infer p from p and q, then you can also infer m from m and n. The systematicity of thinking requires explanation. Why is it that thinkers who can infer p from p and q can also infer m from m and n? RTT+COMP+CCTM gives a compelling explanation. During an inference from p and q to p, you transit from believing* mental sentence \(S_1 \amp S_2\) (which means that p and q) to believing* mental sentence \(S_{1}\) (which means that p). According to CCTM, the transition involves symbol manipulation. A mechanical operation detaches the conjunct \(S_{1}\) from the conjunction \(S_1 \amp S_2\). The same mechanical operation is applicable to a conjunction \(S_{3} \amp S_{4}\) (which means that m and n), corresponding to the inference from m and n to n. An ability to execute the first inference entails an ability to execute the second, because drawing the inference in either case corresponds to executing a single uniform mechanical operation. More generally, logical inference deploys mechanical operations over structured symbols, and the mechanical operation corresponding to a given inference pattern (e.g., conjunction introduction, disjunction elimination, etc.) is applicable to any premises with the right logical structure. The uniform applicability of a single mechanical operation across diverse symbols explains inferential systematicity. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) conclude that inferential systematicity provides reason to accept RTT+COMP+CCTM. Fodor and Pylyshyn (1988) endorse an additional thesis about the mechanical operations corresponding to logical transitions. In keeping with FSC, they claim that the operations are sensitive to formal syntactic properties but not semantic properties. For example, conjunction elimination responds to Mentalese conjunction as a piece of pure formal syntax, much as a computer manipulates items in a formal language without considering what those items mean. Semantic computationalists reject FSC. They claim that mental computation is sometimes sensitive to semantic properties. Semantic computationalists can agree that drawing an inference involves executing a mechanical operation over structured symbols, and they can agree that the same mechanical operation uniformly applies to any premises with appropriate logical structure. So they can still explain inferential systematicity. However, they can also say that the postulated mechanical operation is sensitive to semantic properties. For example, they can say that conjunction elimination is sensitive to the meaning of Mentalese conjunction. In assessing the debate between FSC and semantic computationalism, one must distinguish between logical versus non-logical symbols. For present purposes, it is common ground that the meanings of non-logical symbols do not inform logical inference. The inference from \(S_1 \amp S_2\) to \(S_{1}\) features the same mechanical operation as the inference from \(S_{3} \amp S_{4}\) to \(S_{4}\), and this mechanical operation is not sensitive to the meanings of the conjuncts \(S_{1}\), \(S_{2}\), \(S_{3}\), or \(S_{4}\). It does not follow that the mechanical operation is insensitive to the meaning of Mentalese conjunction. The meaning of conjunction might influence how the logical inference proceeds, even though the meanings of the conjuncts do not.
