 Second-order  logic[1]  was introduced by Frege in his Begriffsschrift (1879) who also coined the term “second order” (“zweiter Ordnung”) in (1884: §53). It was widely used in logic until the 1930s, when set theory started to take over as a foundation of mathematics. It is difficult to say exactly why this happened, but set theory has certain simplicity in being based on one single binary predicate \(x\in y\), compared to second- and higher-order logics, including type theory. Discussion among philosophers of the merits of second-order logic especially in comparison to set theory continues to this day (Shapiro 1991). Meanwhile second-order logic has become a standard tool of computer science logic, finite model theory in particular. Central questions of theoretical computer science, such as the P = NP? question, can be seen as questions about second-order logic in the finite context. Ultimately second-order logic is just another formal language. It can be given the standard treatment making syntax, semantics and proof theory exact by working in a mathematical metatheory which we choose to be set theory. It would be possible to use second-order logic itself as metatheory, but it would be more complicated, simply because second-order logic is less developed than set theory. The distinction between first order logic and second-order logic is easiest to understand in elementary mathematics. Let us consider number theory. The objects of our study are the natural numbers 0, 1, 2,… and their arithmetic. With first order logic we can formulate statements about number theory by using atomic expressions \(x = y,\) \(x+y = z\) and \(x\times y = z\) combined with the propositional operations \(\land,\) \(\neg,\) \(\lor,\) \(\to\) and the quantifiers \(\forall x\) and \(\exists x\). Here the variables x, y, z,… are thought to range over the natural numbers. With second-order logic we can express more: we have variables x, y, z,… as in first order logic for numbers. In addition we have variables X, Y, Z,… for properties of numbers and relations between numbers as well as quantifiers \(\forall X\) and \(\exists X\) for these variables. We have the atomic expressions of first order logic and also new atomic expressions of the form \(X(y_1,\ldots, y_n)\). An interesting and much studied question arises: what properties of natural numbers can be expressed in first order logic and what can be expressed in second-order logic? The question is equally interesting if “expressed” is replaced by “proved”, once a suitable proof system is given in both cases. We can replace natural numbers by some other mathematical context, for example real numbers, complex numbers, and so on. With just the constant \(0\) and the unary function \(n \mapsto n^+\) (where \(n^+\) means \(n+1\)) we can express in second-order logic the Induction Axiom of natural numbers. This, together with the axioms \(\forall x\,\neg(x^+=0)\) and \(\forall x\,\forall y(x^+=y^+\to x=y)\) characterizes the natural numbers with their successor operation up to isomorphism. In first order logic any theory which has a countably infinite model has also an uncountable model (by the Upward Löwenheim Skolem Theorem). Hence (\ref{ind}) cannot be expressed in first order logic. Another typical second-order expression is the Completeness Axiom of the linear order \(\le\) of the real numbers: This, together with the axioms of ordered fields characterizes the ordered field of real numbers up to isomorphism. In first order logic any countable theory which has an infinite model has also a countable model (by the Downward Löwenheim Skolem Theorem). Hence (\ref{comp}) cannot be expressed in first order logic. To early logicians it seemed natural to use second-order logic on a par with first order logic, as if there were not much difference. This included Russell, Löwenheim, Hilbert, and Zermelo. Essentially only Skolem emphasized the difference (see Moore 1988 for the emergence of first order logic). In 1929 Gödel proved his Completeness Theorem and the next year his Incompleteness Theorem. It became gradually obvious that second-order logic is very different from first order logic. One of the first indicators was the incompleteness phenomenon. Gödel showed that any effective axiomatization of number theory is incomplete. On the other hand, there was a simple finite categorical—hence complete  (§10)—axiomatization  of the structure \((\oN,\) \(+,\) \(\times)\) in second-order logic (see also the discussion related to (\ref{ind})). This showed that there cannot be such a complete axiomatization of second-order logic as there was for first order logic. What became known in the case of first order logic as Gödel’s Completeness Theorem simply cannot hold for second-order logic. The situation changed somewhat when Henkin proved the Completeness Theorem for second-order logic with respect to so-called general models  (§9).  Now it became possible to use second-order logic in the same way as first order logic, if only one keeps in mind that the semantics is based on general models. The ability of second-order logic to characterize mathematical structures up to isomorphism does not extend to general models (except in the form of internal categoricity—see  §10).  Any second-order theory with an infinite general model has general models of all infinite cardinalities, and therefore cannot be categorical in the context of general models. We shall discuss general models and the related Henkin models in  §9.
