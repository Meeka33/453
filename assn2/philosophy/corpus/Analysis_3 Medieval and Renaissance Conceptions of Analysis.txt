 Conceptions of analysis in the medieval and renaissance periods were  largely influenced by ancient Greek conceptions. But knowledge of  these conceptions was often second-hand, filtered through a variety  of commentaries and texts that were not always reliable. Medieval and renaissance methodologies tended to be uneasy mixtures of Platonic,  Aristotelian, Stoic, Galenic and neo-Platonic elements, many of them  claiming to have some root in the geometrical conception of analysis  and synthesis. However, in the late medieval period, clearer and more original forms of analysis started to take shape. In the literature  on so-called ‘syncategoremata’ and  ‘exponibilia’, for example, we can trace the development  of a conception of interpretive analysis. Sentences involving more  than one quantifier such as ‘Some donkey every man sees’, for example, were recognized as ambiguous, requiring  ‘exposition’ to clarify. In John Buridan's masterpiece of the mid-fourteenth century,  the Summulae de Dialectica, we can find all three of the  conceptions outlined in   Section 1.1  above. He distinguishes explicitly between divisions, definitions and demonstrations, corresponding to decompositional, interpretive and  regressive analysis, respectively. Here, in particular, we have  anticipations of modern analytic philosophy as much as reworkings of  ancient philosophy. Unfortunately, however, these clearer forms of  analysis became overshadowed during the Renaissance, despite—or perhaps because of—the growing interest in the original Greek  sources. As far as understanding analytic methodologies was  concerned, the humanist repudiation of scholastic logic muddied the  waters.
