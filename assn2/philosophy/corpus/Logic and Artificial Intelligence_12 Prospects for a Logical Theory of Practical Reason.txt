 There is reason to hope that the combination of logical methods with planning applications in AI can enable the development of a far more comprehensive and adequate theory of practical reasoning than has heretofore been possible. As with many problems having to do with common sense reasoning, the scale and complexity of the formalizations that are required are beyond the traditional techniques of philosophical logic. However, with computational methods of implementing and testing the formalizations and with areas such as cognitive robotics to serve as laboratories for developing and testing ideas, we can hope to radically advance a problem that has seen little progress since it was first proposed by Aristotle: the problem of devising a formalization of practical reasoning that is genuinely applicable to common sense reasoning problems. The classical work in deontic logic that was begun by von Wright (see  von Wright 1983)  is one source of ideas; see  (Horty 2001,  van der Torre 1997).  In fact, as the more recent work in deontic logic shows, nonmonotonic logic provides a natural and useful supplement to the classical deontic logic.  One recent work (Horty 2012) seeks  to base deontic logic on a prioritized version of Reiterâ€™s default logic. An even more robust account of practical reasoning begins to emerge when these ideas are supplemented with work on the foundations of planning and reasoning about action that were discussed in  Section 4,  above. But this development can be pursued even further, by extending the formalism to include preferences and intentions.[42] Ultimately, what is needed is a model of an intelligent reasoning and acting agent. Developing such a model need not be entirely a matter of logic, but according to one school of thought, logic has a central role to play in it; see, for instance,  Baral & Gelfond 2000,  Wobcke et al. 1998,  Rao & Georgeff 1991,  Burkhard et al. 1998).
