 Although ‘possible world’ has been part of the  philosophical lexicon at least since Leibniz, the notion became  firmly entrenched in contemporary philosophy with the development of  possible world semantics for the languages of propositional and first-order modal logic. In addition to the usual sentence operators of  classical logic such as ‘and’ (‘∧’), ‘or’ (‘∨’), ‘not’ (‘¬’), ‘if...then’ (‘→’), and, in the first-order case, the quantifiers ‘all’ (‘∀’) and ‘some’ (‘∃’), these languages contain operators intended to represent the modal adverbs ‘necessarily’ (‘□’) and ‘possibly’ (‘◇’). Although a prominent aspect of logic in both Aristotle's work and the work of many medieval philosophers, modal logic was largely ignored from the modern period to the mid-20th century. And even though a variety of modal deductive systems had in fact been rigorously developed in the early 20th century, notably by Lewis and Langford (1932), there was for the languages of those systems nothing comparable to the elegant semantics that Tarski had provided for the languages of classical first-order logic. Consequently, there was no rigorous account of what it means for a sentence in those languages to be true and, hence, no account of the critical semantic notions of validity and logical consequence to underwrite the corresponding deductive notions of theoremhood and provability. A concomitant philosophical consequence of this void in modal logic was a deep skepticism, voiced most prominently by Quine, toward any appeal to modal notions in metaphysics generally, notably, the notion of an essential property. (See Quine 1953 and 1956, and the appendix to Plantinga 1974.) The purpose of the following two subsections is to provide a simple and largely ahistorical overview of how possible world semantics fills this void; the final subsection presents two important applications of the semantics. (Readers familiar with basic possible world semantics can skip to §2 with no significant loss of continuity.) Since the middle ages at least, philosophers have recognized a  semantical distinction between extension and  intension. The extension of a denoting expression, or  term, such as a name or a definite description is its  referent, the thing that it refers to; the extension of a predicate  is the set of things it applies to; and the extension of a sentence  is its truth value. By contrast, the intension of an expression is  something rather less definite — its sense, or  meaning, the semantical aspect of the expression that  determines its extension. For purposes here, let us say that a  logic is a formal language together with a semantic theory for the language, that is, a theory that provides rigorous definitions of truth, validity, and logical consequence for the   language.[2]  A logic is extensional if the truth value of every sentence  of the logic is determined entirely by its form and the extensions of its component sentences, predicates, and terms. An extensional logic  will thus typically feature a variety of valid substitutivity  principles. A substitutivity principle says that, if two  expressions are coextensional, that is, if they have the same  extension, then (subject perhaps to some reasonable conditions)  either can be substituted for the other in any sentence salva  veritate, that is, without altering the original sentence's truth value. In an   intensional logic,  the truth values of some sentences are determined by something over  and above their forms and the extensions of their components and, as  a consequence, at least one classical substitutivity principle is  typically rendered invalid. Extensionality is a well known and generally cherished feature of  classical propositional and predicate logic. Modal logic, by  contrast, is intensional. To illustrate: the substitutivity principle for sentences tells us that sentences with the same truth value can  be substituted for one another salva veritate. So suppose that John's only pets are two dogs, Algol and BASIC, say, and consider two simple sentences and their formalizations (the predicates in question indicating the obvious English counterparts): As both sentences are true, they have the same extension. Hence, in  accordance with the classical substitutivity principle for sentences, we can replace the occurrence of (1) with (2) in the false sentence and the result is the equally false sentence However, when we make the same substitution in the true sentence the result is the sentence which is intuitively false, as John surely could have had a  non-mammalian pet. In a modal logic that accurately represents the  logic of the necessity operator, therefore, the substitutivity  principle for sentences will have to fail. The same example illustrates that the substitutivity principle for  predicates will have to fail in modal logic as well. For, according  to our example, the predicates ‘D’ and  ‘P’ that are true of John's dogs and of John's  pets, respectively, are coextensional, i.e.,  ∀x(Dx ↔ Px). However, while  substituting the latter predicate for the former in (3) results in a  sentence with the same truth value, the same substitution in (5) does not. Modal logic, therefore, is intensional: in general, the truth  value of a sentence is determined by something over and above its  form and the extensions of its components. Absent a rigorous semantic theory to identify the source of its intensionality and to  systematize intuitions about modal truth, validity, and logical  consequence, there was little hope for the widespread acceptance of  modal logic. The idea of possible worlds raised the prospect of extensional  respectability for modal logic, not by rendering modal logic itself  extensional, but by endowing it with an extensional semantic theory  — one whose own logical foundation is that of classical  predicate logic and, hence, one on which possibility and necessity  can ultimately be understood along classical Tarskian lines.  Specifically, in possible world semantics, the modal operators are interpreted as quantifiers over possible worlds, as  expressed informally in the following two general principles: Given this, the failures of the classical substitutivity principles  can be traced to the fact that modal operators, so interpreted,  introduce contexts that require subtler notions of meaning for sentences and their component parts than are  provided in classical logic; in particular, a subtler notion (to be  clarified shortly) is required for predicates than that of the set of things they happen to apply to. Tarskian Semantics. Standard model theoretic semantics for the languages of predicate logic deriving from the work of Tarski (1933,  1944) is the paradigmatic semantic theory for extensional logics.  Given a standard first-order language ℒ, a Tarskian  interpretation I for ℒ specifies a set D for the quantifiers of ℒ to range over (typically, some set of things that ℒ has been designed to describe) and assigns, to each  term (constant or variable) τ of ℒ, a referent  aτ ∈ D and, to each n-place  predicate π of ℒ, an appropriate extension  Eπ — a truth value (TRUE or FALSE) if  n = 0, a subset of D if n = 1, and a set of  n-tuples of members of D if n > 1. Given these  assignments, sentences are evaluated as true under the interpretation I — trueI, for short — according to a more or less familiar set of clauses. To facilitate the definition, let I[ν/a] be the interpretation that assigns the individual a to the variable ν and is otherwise exactly like I. Then we have: Clauses for the other standard Boolean operators and the existential  quantifier under their usual definitions follow straightaway from  these clauses. In particular, where it follows that: It is easy to verify that, in each of the above cases, replacing one  coextensional term, predicate, or sentence for another has no effect  on the truth values rendered by the above clauses, thus guaranteeing  the validity of the classical substitutivity principles and, hence,  the extensionality of first-order logic with a Tarskian semantics. From Tarskian to Possible World Semantics. The truth  conditional clauses for the three logical operators directly reflect  the meanings of the natural language expressions they symbolize:  ‘¬’ means not; ‘→’ means  if...then; ‘∀’ means all. It is  easy to see, however, that we cannot expect to add an equally simple  clause for sentences containing an operator that symbolizes  necessity. For a Tarskian interpretation fixes the domain of quantification and the extensions of all the predicates. Pretty  clearly, however, to capture necessity and possibility, one must be  able to consider alternative “possible” domains of  quantification and alternative “possible” extensions for  predicates as well. For, intuitively, under different circumstances,  fewer, more, or other things might have existed and things that  actually exist might, in those circumstances, have had very different properties. (6), for example, is false because John could have had  non-mammalian pets: a canary, say, or a turtle, or, under  very different circumstances, a dragon. A bit more formally  put: Both the domain of quantification and the extension of the  predicate ‘P’ could, in some sense or other, have  been different. Possible world semantics, of course, uses the concept of a possible world to give substance to the idea of alternative extensions and alternative domains of quantification. (Possible world semantics can be traced most clearly back to the work of Carnap (1947), its basic development culminating in the work of Hintikka (1957, 1961), Bayart (1958, 1959), and Kripke (1959, 1963a, 1963b).[5]) Similar to Tarskian semantics, a possible world interpretation M of a modal language ℒ specifies a nonempty set D, although thought of now as the set of “possible individuals” of M. Also as in Tarskian semantics, M assigns each term τ of ℒ a referent aτ in D.[6] Additionally however, M specifies a set W, the set of “possible worlds” of M, one of which is designated its “actual world”, and each world w in W is assigned its own domain of quantification, d(w) ⊆ D, intuitively, the set of individuals that exist in w.[7] To capture the idea of both the actual and possible extensions of a predicate, M assigns to each n-place predicate π a function Mπ — the intension of π — that, for each possible world w, returns the extension Mπ(w) of π at w: a truth value, if n = 0; a set of individuals, if n = 1; and a set of n-tuples of individuals, if n > 1.[8] We can thus rigorously define a “possible extension” of a predicate π to be any of its w-extensions Mπ(w), for any world w. The Tarskian truth conditions above are now generalized by  relativizing them to worlds as follows: for any possible world  w (the world of evaluation): And to these, of course, is added the critical modal case that  explicitly interprets the modal operator to be a quantifier over  worlds, as we'd initially anticipated informally in our principle   Nec: A sentence φ is falseM at w       just in case it is not trueM at w, and       φ is said to be trueM just in case       φ is trueM at the actual world of       M. On the assumption that there is a (nonempty) set of all possible       worlds and a set of all possible individuals, we can define       “objective” notions of truth at a world and of truth       simpliciter, that is, notions that are not simply       relative to formal, mathematical interpretations but, rather,       correspond to objective reality in all its modal glory. Let       ℒ be a modal language whose names and predicates represent       those in some fragment of ordinary language (as in our examples       (5) and (6) above). Say that M is the        “intended” interpretation of ℒ if (i) its set       W of “possible worlds” is in fact the set of       all possible worlds, (ii) its designated “actual       world” is in fact the actual world, (iii) its set D       of “possible individuals” is in fact the set of all       possible individuals, and (iv) the referents assigned to the       names of ℒ and the intensions assigned to the predicates       of ℒ are the ones they in fact have. Then, where M        is the intended interpretation of ℒ, we can say that       a sentence φ of ℒ is        true at a possible world w just in case φ        is trueM at w, and       that φ is true just in case it is       trueM at the actual world. (Falsity at       w and falsity, simpliciter, are defined accordingly.) Under the       assumption in question, then, the modal clause above takes on pretty much the       exact form of our informal principle Nec. Call the above basic possible world semantics.  Spelling     out the truth conditions for (6) (relative to the     intended interpretation of its language), basic     possible world semantics tells us that (6) is     true if and only if And by unpacking (8) in terms of the quantificational, material conditional,  and atomic clauses above we have that (6) is true if and only if Since we are evaluating (6) with regard to the intended interpretation of its language, the w-extension of ‘P’ that is returned by its intension, for any world w, is the (perhaps empty) set of John's pets in w and that of ‘M’ is the set of mammals in w. Hence, if w is a world where John has a pet canary — COBOL, say — COBOL is in the w-extension of ‘P’ but not that of ‘M’ , i.e., ‘∀x(Px → Mx)’ is false at w and, hence, by the truth condition (9), (6) is false at the actual world — that is, (6) is false simpliciter, as it should be. Note that interpreting modal operators as quantifiers over possible  worlds provides a nice theoretical justification for the usual  definition of the possibility operator in terms of necessity,  specifically: That is, a sentence is possible just in case its negation isn't  necessary. Since, semantically speaking, the necessity  operator is literally a universal quantifier, the definition corresponds exactly to the definition   (7)  of the existential quantifier. For, unpacking the right side of  definition (10) according to the negation and necessitation clauses above (and invoking the definitions of truth and truth at a world simpliciter), we have: Clearly, however, if it is not the case that φ fails to be true  at all possible worlds, then it must be true at some world; hence: And that corresponds exactly to our intuitive truth condition   Poss  above. Thus, spelling out the negation  ‘¬□∀x(Px →  Mx)’ of our false sentence   (6)  above in accordance with definition (10) (and the standard definition of conjunction ∧), we have: for which (12) and the possible world truth conditions for  quantified, Boolean, and atomic sentences yield the correct truth condition: that is, less stuffily, there is a possible world in which, among  John's pets, at least one is not a mammal. Summary: Intensionality and Possible Worlds. Analyzed in terms of possible world semantics, then, the general failure of classical  substitutivity principles in modal logic is due, not to an  irreducibly intensional element in the meanings of the modal  operators, but rather to a sort of mismatch between the surface  syntax of those operators and their semantics: syntactically, they  are unary sentence operators like negation; but semantically, they  are, quite literally, quantifiers. Their syntactic similarity to  negation suggests that, like negation, the truth values of  ⌈□φ⌉ and  ⌈◇φ⌉, insofar as they are determinable at all, must be determined by the truth value of φ.  That they are not (in general) so determined leads to the distinctive substitutivity failures noted above. The possible worlds analysis of  the modal operators as quantifiers over worlds reveals that the unary syntactic form of the modal operators obscures a semantically  relevant parameter. When the modal operators are interpreted as  quantifiers, this parameter becomes explicit and the reason  underlying the failure of extensionality in modal logic becomes  clear: That the truth values of  ⌈□φ⌉ and  ⌈◇φ⌉ are not in general  determined by the truth value of φ at the world of evaluation is, semantically speaking, nothing more than the fact that the truth  values of ‘∀xFx’ and  ‘∃xFx’ are not in general determined by the  truth value of ‘Fx’, for any particular value of  ‘x’. Possible world semantics, therefore,  explains the intensionality of modal logic by revealing that the syntax of the modal operators prevents an adequate expression of  the meanings of the sentences in which they occur. Spelled out as  possible world truth conditions, those meanings can be expressed in a wholly extensional fashion.   (For  a more formal exposition of this point, see the supplemental article   The Extensionality of Possible World Semantics.) As noted, the focus of the present article is on the metaphysics of  possible worlds rather than applications. Of course, the semantics of modal languages is itself an application, but one that is of singular importance, both for historical reasons and because most applications are in fact themselves applications of (often extended or modified  versions of) the semantical apparatus. Two particularly important  examples are the analysis of intensions and a concomitant explication of the de re/de dicto   distinction.[10] The Analysis of Intensions. As much a barrier to the  acceptance of modal logic as intensionality itself was the need to  appeal to intensions per se — properties, relations,  propositions, and the like — in semantical explanations.  Intensional entities have of course featured prominently in the  history of philosophy since Plato and, in particular, have played  natural explanatory roles in the analysis of   intentional attitudes  like   belief  and   mental content.  For all their prominence and importance, however, the nature of these entities has often been obscure and controversial and, indeed, as a  consequence, they were easily dismissed as ill-understood and  metaphysically suspect “creatures of darkness” (Quine  1956, 180) by the naturalistically oriented philosophers of the  early- to mid-20th century. It is a virtue of possible world  semantics that it yields rigorous definitions for  intensional entities. More specifically, as described above, possible world semantics assigns to each n-place predicate π a  certain function Iπ — π's intension  — that, for each possible world w, returns the extension Iπ(w) of π at w. We can define  an intension per se, independent of any language, to be any  such function on worlds. More specifically: The adequacy of this analysis is a matter of lively debate that  focuses chiefly upon whether or not intensions, so defined, are too  “coarse-grained” to serve their intended purposes. (See,  e.g., Stalnaker 1987 and 2012 for a strong defense of the analysis.)  However, Lewis (1986, §1.5) argues that, even if the above  analysis fails for certain purposes, it does not follow that  intensions cannot be analyzed in terms of possible worlds, but only  that more subtle constructions might be required. This reply appears  to side-step the objections from granularity while preserving the  great advantage of the possible worlds analysis of intensions, viz.,  the rigorous definability of these philosophically significant  notions. The De Re / De Dicto Distinction. A particularly rich application of the possible world analysis of intensions  concerns the analysis of the venerable distinction between de  re and de dicto   modality.[11]  Among the strongest modal intuitions is that the possession of a  property has a modal character — that things exemplify, or fail to exemplify, some properties necessarily, or  essentially, and others only accidentally. Thus, for example, intuitively, John's dog Algol is a pet accidentally; under less fortunate circumstances, she might have been, say, a stray that no one ever adopted. But she is a dog essentially; she couldn't have been a flower, a musical performance, a crocodile or any other kind of thing. Spelling out this understanding in terms of worlds and the preceding  analysis of intensions, we can say that an individual a has a  property F essentially if a has F in every world in which it exists, that is, if, for all worlds w in which  a exists, a ∈ F(w). Likewise,  a has F accidentally if a has F in the  actual world @ but lacks it in some other world, that is, if a ∈ F(@) but, for some world w in which a  exists, a ∉ F(w). Thus, let  ‘G’ and ‘T’ symbolize ‘is a dog’ and ‘is someone's pet’, respectively; then,  where ‘E!x’ is short for  ‘∃y(x=y)’ (and, hence,  expresses that x exists), we have: More generally, sentences like (15) and (16) in which properties are  ascribed to a specific individual in a modal context — signaled formally by the occurrence of a name or the free occurrence of a  variable in the scope of a modal operator — are said to exhibit modality de   re[12]  (modality of the thing). Modal sentences that do not, like are said to exhibit modality de dicto (roughly, modality  of the proposition).  Possible world semantics provides an illuminating analysis of the key difference between the two: The truth conditions for both modalities  involve a commitment to possible worlds; however, the truth  conditions for sentences exhibiting modality de re involve in  addition a commitment to the meaningfulness of   transworld identity,  the thesis that, necessarily, every individual (typically, at any  rate) exists and exemplifies (often very different) properties in  many different possible worlds. More specifically, basic possible  world semantics yields intuitively correct truth values for sentences of the latter sort by (i) permitting world domains to overlap and  (ii) assigning intensions to predicates, thereby, in effect,  relativizing predicate extensions to worlds. In this way, one and the same individual can be in the extension of a given predicate at all  worlds in which they exist, at some such worlds only, or at none at  all. (For further discussion, see the entry on  essential vs. accidental properties.)
