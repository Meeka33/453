 Each departure from classical quantificational logic we have considered originated from an objection to either axioms of pure quantificational logic or the Tarskian definition of satisfaction in a model by an assignment of objects to the variables of the language. We now take both for granted and look at proposed extensions of classical quantificational logic with new styles of quantification. Each extension will generally require us to add new axioms for the new styles of quantification and to expand the Tarskian definition of truth in a model in terms of satisfaction. Frege originally conceived of the quantifier \(\forall\) as a monadic predicate that is true of a first-level concept \(F\) under which only objects fall if, and only if, all objects fall under \(F\); likewise, Frege assimilated \(\exists\) to a monadic predicate that is true of a first-level concept if, and only if, at least one object falls under \(F\). In modern terms, we may say that the truth conditions of \(\forall x \ A\) are given in terms of a certain condition on the extension of the formula \(A\). Given a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) and a formula \(A(x)\) with a single free variable \(x\), it will be convenient to use \(A(x)[d]\) to abbreviate: \(A\) is satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by variable assignments on which \(d\) is the value assigned to the variable \(x\). The extension of a formula \(A(x)\) with a single free variable \(x\) in a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) is just \(\{ d \in D: A(x)[d] \}\), which we may abbreviate \(I(A)\). The contemporary study of generalized quantifiers begins with Mostowski (1957) and Lindström (1966) (the entry on  generalized quantifiers  provides a survey of recent developments and applications in logic and natural language). Lindström and Mowstoski began with a generalization of Frege’s conception of a quantifier in at least two dimensions. First, they considered additional unary quantifiers \(Q(A)\), which behave syntactically like \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) but set a different condition on the extension of \(A\). Second, they considered binary quantifiers \(Q(A, B)\), which set a given condition based on a relation between the extensions of \(A\) and \(B\). Cardinality quantifiers provide a simple example of the first sort of generalization. If we write \(card(S)\) to denote the cardinality of a given set \(S\), we may introduce unary quantifiers of the form \(Q(A)\), which set a cardinality condition on the extension of a formula \(A\): \(\exists_{\geq n}\) is read: “at least \(n\) objects” and \(\exists !_{n}\) is read: “exactly \(n\) objects.” Both quantifiers are definable in terms of a standard quantifier against the background of classical quantificational logic. Other cardinality quantifiers, however, do increase the expressive power of classical quantifical logic. We may, for example, introduce cardinality quantifiers of the form \(Q(A)\), which require the extension of \(A\) to have an infinite cardinality: \(\aleph_0\) is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, and \(\aleph_1\) is the next transfinite  cardinal.[9]  When we supplement classical quantificational logic with \(Q_0\), read: “at least \(\aleph_0\) objects”, we must relinquish Compactness even if we can still retain the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. The opposite is the case, however, when we supplement classical quantificational logic with \(Q_1\), read: “at least \(\aleph_1\) objects” instead. Two more cardinality quantifiers that have been studied in the literature are the Chang quantifier and the Rescher quantifier: The Chang quantifier collapses into \(\forall\) only in the finite case; if \(D\) is infinite, then the extension of a formula \(A\), \(I(A)\), may match the cardinality of the domain, \(D\), even if the two sets are different, i.e., \(I(A) \neq D\). The second dimension of generalization concerns the number of arguments we let quantifiers take. We can, for example, introduce binary quantifiers, \(Q(A, B)\), whose truth condition is given in terms of a binary relation between the extension of the formula \(A\) and the extension of the formula \(B\) in a model. As defined above, \(Most(A, B)\), for example, is true if and only if more objects are both \(A\) and \(B\) than there are objects that are \(A\) and not \(B\). Of special interest in the philosophy of language is the case of Russellian definite descriptions, which can be subsumed under the category of a binary quantifier: For a systematic discussion of these issues, the reader may consult Peters & Westerståhl (2006). We generally let quantifiers bind a single type of variable, but we may find it helpful, on occasion, to let them bind additional types of variables in order to quantify over different sorts of values. In arithmetic, for example, we may want to be able to quantify over natural numbers and sets thereof and we may find it convenient to classify the individual variables of the language into at least two categories. We may reserve lowercase variables \(x, y, z, x_1\), … to range over natural numbers, and we may use uppercase variables \(X, Y, Z, X_1\), … to range over sets of natural numbers. In a many-sorted language with functional symbols and individual constants, each singular term would be assigned a single sort. If we want identity, we need to include an identity predicate for each sort of a variable and insist on each such predicate to be flanked only by singular terms of the appropriate sort. Other predicates may nevertheless take arguments of different sorts; for example, in a two-sorted language in which lowercase variables range over numbers and uppercase variables range over sets of numbers, \(x \epsilon X\), for example, can take as arguments variables of different sorts and may be read “\(x\) is in \(X\)”. To accommodate the new styles of variables in the model theory for many-sorted logic, we may add a domain for each style of variable. A model for a two-sorted language, for example, may consist of an ordered triple \(\langle D_1, D_2, I\rangle\) in which \(D_1\) and \(D_2\) specify the domain of quantification associated to each style of variable, and \(I\) is an interpretation function, which assigns appropriate values and extensions to each expression in the non-logical vocabulary. (Since each singular term is assigned a sort, \(I\) must be constrained to make sure singular terms of each sort denote objects in the appropriate domain.) The metatheory for many-sorted logic is closely related to the metatheory for classical quantificational logic. One may, for example, prove many-sorted versions of Compactness and the Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. Details may be found in Enderton 2001. However, the move to a many-sorted language is largely a matter of convenience. Many-sorted quantification may be analyzed in terms of restricted one-sorted quantification. For each many-sorted language with \(n\) styles of variable, we may introduce a one-sorted language, which comes with a one-place predicate, \(S_i\), for each sort in the many-sorted language. We may set out to translate each formula of the many-sorted language into a formula of the one-sorted language: we translate each identity in terms of a single identity predicate; a quantification on a variable of sort \(i\), \(\forall x^i \ A\), is replaced with a formula of the form \(\forall x (S_i x \rightarrow A)\). We may, in addition, turn each model for the many-sorted language \(\langle D_1, \ldots, D_n, I \rangle\) into a model for the resulting one-sorted language \(\langle \bigcup_{n} D_n, I^\ast \rangle\) in which we take the domain to consist in the union of the domains associated to each original sort. The interpretation function, \(I^\ast\) will coincide with \(I\) when it comes to predicates and individual constants. However, \(I^\ast\) will generally have to extend the interpretation of a functional symbol, \(f^n_i\), by \(I\), in one way or another. Finally, \(I^\ast\) will interpret the identity predicate as usual. Still, even if there is no real gain in expressive power, one reason to flag the availability of many-sorted quantification is because some of the extensions of classical quantificational logic to be examined below are closely related to certain theories couched in the language of two-sorted logic. In particular, second-order logic and the theory of plural quantification will be each closely related to two first-order two-sorted theories, which lack the expressive resources often attributed to each extension of classical quantificational logic. Second-order logic is an extension of classical quantificational logic in which we allow for quantification into predicate position. Second-order logic originated with Frege (1879), which developed a formal language equipped with predicate variables of the form \(X^{n}_{i}\). Predicate variables behave syntactically like \(n\)-place predicates of the form \(P^{n}_{i}\). In second-order logic, we allow a predicate variable \(X^{n}_{i}\) followed by \(n\) variables \(X^{n}x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\) to count as an atomic formula. Likewise, we allow the quantifiers \(\forall\) and \(\exists\) to bind predicate and individual variables as in \(\forall X^{n} \ A\) and \(\exists X^{n} \ A\). The axioms for second-order logic supplement the axioms of classical quantificational logic with distinctive axioms for the second-order quantifiers. Call a predicate variable \(Y^n\) free for \(X^n\) in \(A\) if, and only if, no free occurrences of \(X^n\) lie within the scope of a quantification on \(Y^n\), \(\forall Y^n\) or \(\exists Y^n\): (\(\forall^2 1\)) is a second-order version of universal instantiation. The second-order version of universal generalization becomes: Observe that while \(\forall X \ Xx \rightarrow P x\) is an instance of (\(\forall^2 1\)), the formula \(\forall X \ Xx \rightarrow (P x \wedge Q x)\) is not an instance of the axiom. But whatever one takes the value of a second-order variable to be, you may think that there should be one under which an object falls if and only if it satisfies the condition stated by the formula \((P x \wedge Q x)\). To make sure, we may rely on an axiom of second-order comprehension: A formula like \(\forall X \ Xx \rightarrow (P x \wedge Q x)\) now follows from the combination of second-order universal instantiation and an instance of second-order comprehension: \(\exists X \forall x(Xx \leftrightarrow (P x \wedge Q  x))\).[10] To develop a model theory for a second-order language, we may still take a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) to consist of a non-empty domain and an interpretation function. We now let an assignment \(s\) for \(\langle D, I\rangle\) to be a function that assigns a member of \(D\) to each individual variable and a set of \(n\)-tuples of members of \(D\) to each predicate variable \(X^n\). We then modify the definition of satisfaction to let a formula of the form \(\forall X^n \ B\) be satisfied in \(\langle D, I \rangle\) by an assignment \(s\) if, and only if, \(B\) is satisfied by all assignments of the form \(s[X^n/R^n]\), where \(R^n\) is a set of \(n\)-tuples of members of \(D_1\). The definitions of truth in a model and validity proceed exactly as in the first-order case. The entry on  second-order and higher-order logic  provides more detail and gives some indication of the complexity of the set of valid second-order formulas in the standard model theory for second-order logic. No Completeness, Compactness, or Löwenheim-Skolem theorem is available for second-order logic with standard models. The entry on  second-order and higher-order logic  provides concrete illustrations of these facts. A Henkin model lets a second-order variable \(X^n\) range over some subset of the set of \(n\)-tuples of members of the domain \(D\). Thus a Henkin model consists of a domain \(D\) of individuals, a domain \(D^n_2\) of sets of \(n\)-tuples of objects in \(D\) for each \(n \leq 1\), and an interpretation function \(I\). To make sure that every instance of second-order comprehension is validated in the model, we require each \(D^n_2\) to contain every set of \(n\)-tuples of members of \(D\) that is definable by a formula \(A\) of the language. This is what the entry on  second-order and higher-order logic  calls general semantics. The metatheory of second-order logic with Henkin models is very much like the metatheory of classical quantificational logic in that it is complete, compact, and subject to a Löwenheim-Skolem theorem. One reason for this is that second-order logic under the Henkin model theory is only a notational variant of a two-sorted first-order theory in which the axioms of quantificational logic are supplemented by suitable axioms of comprehension. Which model theory is more appropriate for second-order logic? There is a trade-off between the attractive features of the metatheory of second-order logic with Henkin models, on the one hand, and the expressive power of second-order logic with standard models, on the other. Frege’s own interest in second-order quantification had much to do with its ability to express the concept of the ancestral of a dyadic relation \(R\), which allowed him in turn to define the concept natural number in terms of \(0\) and successor. For details, the reader may consult the entry on  Frege’s Theorem and Foundations of Arithmetic.  There are, in addition, categorical axiomatizations of arithmetic, where a set of sentences is categorical if, and only if, all of its models are isomorphic, which means that there is only one model up to isomorphism. Dedekind (1893) famously proved, for example, that the second-order formulation of the Peano Axioms characterized the structure of the natural number system. There is a similar result for real analysis. For second-order set theory, Zermelo (1930) observed that given two models of second-order Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, one is isomorphic to a strongly inaccessible initial segment of the other. The entry on  set theory  describes the axioms of set theory. Other examples of the expressive resources afforded by second-order quantification with standard models are discussed in Shapiro (1991). The adoption of a model theory based on Henkin models requires one to surrender all these applications. Much like in the case of pure quantificational logic, no model—standard or otherwise—for the language of second-order logic interprets the quantifiers to range over a universal domain of discourse. But if there are interpretations of the language of second-order logic to which no model corresponds, the question arises again of whether truth in all models is tantamount to truth under all interpretations of the language. Unfortunately, in the absence of a Completeness theorem, Kreisel’s argument is not available for second-order logic with standard models. One may nevertheless argue that a formula is true in all models only if it is true under all interpretations of the language by appeal to a second-order principle of reflection. This reflection principle makes sure that a formula \(A\) of the language of second-order set theory is true when the quantifiers are taken to range unrestrictedly over the universal domain if, and only if, \(A\) is true when the quantifiers are restricted to some set-sized initial segment of the universe of a certain  sort.[11]  Shapiro (1987) discusses both the set-theoretic principle and its role in the justification of the claim that if a sentence is true in every standard model, then it is true under every interpretation of the language. Unfortunately, second-order reflection takes us beyond the scope of second-order Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory and the axiom of choice (ZFC). To make sense of interpretations over a universal domain, one may conceive of an interpretation as a value of a second-order predicate variable, \(I\), which applies to ordered pairs of a certain sort. An interpretation, \(I\), applies to ordered pairs of the form \(\langle \forall, o \rangle\), when \(o\) is in the domain of the interpretation, and \(I\) applies to ordered pairs of the form \(\langle P^{n}_{i}, \langle a_1, \ldots, a_n\rangle \rangle\), when \(P^{n}_{i}\) is taken to apply to the objects in \(\langle a_1, \ldots, a_n\rangle\). The usual definition of an assignment is then replaced by one on which an assignment is given by the value of a second-order variable \(S\), which applies to an ordered pair of the form \(\langle x, o\rangle\), where \(o\) is an object, for each first-order variable in the language, and to ordered pairs of the form \(\langle X, o\rangle\), where \(o\) is an object, for each second-order variable in the language. An assignment \(S\) is required to pair each first-order variable with exactly one object, but it is allowed to pair a second-order variable with any objects whatever. In the presence of these definitions, we can generalize Tarski’s definition satisfaction in an interpretation by an assignment, truth, and  validity.[12] The status of second-order quantification remains a highly controversial issue. In the standard model theory for second-order quantification, we explain the truth conditions of a formula of the form \(\forall X \ A\) in terms of ordinary quantification over sets. And this may incline one to follow Quine (1986) in claiming that second-order quantification is only intelligible as first-order quantification over sets of the domain of individuals. Second-order logic would, on this view, be best conceived as a species of two-sorted first-order set theory. But the mere fact that in the standard semantics for second-order logic, we state the truth conditions for second-order quantification in terms of first-order quantification over sets is not to admit that this is the only, much less the intended interpretation of second-order quantification. Frege certainly had a very different interpretation in mind. For a defense of the claim that second-order quantification should be taken at face value, the reader may consult Williamson (2003). Similar remarks apply to the logic of a plural quantifier like “some objects”. Indeed, much of the recent interest in plural quantification in logic and philosophy began with Boolos (1984), who provided a plural interpretation of monadic second-order quantification. Boolos wanted to defend second-order axiomatizations of set theory against the charge that second-order quantification cannot be coherently deployed over the domain of all sets. Boolos (1984) explained how to interpret the second-order quantifier, \(\forall X\), over the domain of all sets in terms of the plural quantifier “some sets”, and how to interpret atomic formulas of the form \(Xx\) in terms of the plural locution “is one of”. The fact that plural locutions are systematically used and perfectly understood in natural language, Boolos thought, helped address the charge of incoherence. The Boolos translation is described in detail in the entry on  plural quantification. Whatever the merits of the Boolos translation, plural quantification is nowadays generally distinguished from second-order quantification on the grounds that they bind expressions of different syntactic and semantic categories—while predicates are unsaturated in Frege’s terminology and contain argument places to be completed by expressions of an appropriate syntactic category, plural terms are often thought to be akin to saturated singular terms. Different variations on this theme may be found, for example, in Higginbotham 1998; Oliver & Smiley 2001; Rayo & Yablo 2001; Williamson 2003, 2013. This is a book, which includes an extensive discussion of important differences in the behavior of plural and second-order quantification in modal contexts. Plural quantification has consequently become the subject of its own study. The language of plural quantification is carefully described in the entry on  plural quantification.  Syntactically, it is closely related to a two-sorted first-order language in which we have an infinite number of variables \(xx\), \(yy\), \(zz\), \(xx_{1}\), …. , and a two-place predicate \(\prec\), read “one of,” which will be flanked by singular and plural terms, respectively. Identity predicate can only flanked by singular terms. The axioms for plural quantification extend the axioms of quantificational logic with plural counterparts of (\(\forall 1\)), (\(\forall 2\)), and (\(\forall 3\)). Like in the second-order case, the axioms of quantification are supplemented with an axiom schema of plural comprehension: One important difference with respect to monadic second-order logic is that instances of plural comprehension are conditionals that state that if something satisfies a certain condition, then some objects are all and only objects satisfying the condition. The antecedent of each conditional is motivated by an interpretation of the plural quantifier \(\exists xx\) to mean “one or more objects”. Indeed, Linnebo (2013) explicitly supplements the theory of plural quantification with an axiom that states that no matter what some objects may be, there is at least one of them: Like in the case of second-order logic, we may provide at least two sorts of models for the theory of plural quantification. In both cases, we interpret plural quantification in terms of quantification over non-empty sets of individuals in the domain \(D\). The difference is that in standard models we let plural variables range over the full power set of \(D\), whereas plural variables range over a set \(S\) of non-empty subsets of \(D\), provided only that \(S\) contains all sets definable by some formula. Both approaches take place in a singular metalanguage. Since the models are based on set theory, they require the domain of individuals to form a set. Furthermore, the definition of satisfaction explains what is for a formula \(\forall xx \ A\) to be satisfied in a model by an assignment in terms of singular quantification over non-empty subsets of the domain of individuals. This may perhaps encourage the impression that plural quantification is only intelligible as singular quantification over non-empty sets of individuals. Note, however, that neither the use of set-based models nor the use of singular quantification in the definition of satisfaction for a formula of the form \(\forall xx\) is compulsory. In a plural metatheory in which we have a theory of ordered pairs, one may adapt the generalized conception of an interpretation developed in Rayo & Uzquiano (1999) to provide a plural model theory in which one uses neither. This model theory is developed, for example, in Burgess 2004. The status of plural quantification remains the subject of intense controversy. All parties agree that plural locutions are systematically used in natural languages, but there is no consensus as to whether or not the truth conditions for plurally quantified sentences should ultimately involve covert reference to complex objects of some kind or another. The entry on  plural quantification  discusses some reasons generally offered in favor of the irreducibility of plural quantification to singular quantification over sets. But an influential argument against the identification of plural quantification and singular quantification over sets traces back to Boolos 1984, which claims that the following two sentences differ in truth value when we let the domain of quantification include all sets there are: There is a set of all, and only, non-self-membered sets. Some sets are all, and only, non-self-membered sets. We know from Russell’s paradox that there is no set of all, and only, non-self-membered sets, which makes the first sentence  false.[13]  But this is not to deny of course that some sets are all and only non-self-membered sets, even if they fail to compose a set. Unfortunately, the argument depends on a certain interpretation of Russell’s paradox that is itself controversial and will fail to convince philosophers who think that the moral of Russell’s paradox is that no singular quantifier can range unrestrictedly over all the sets there are. We will revisit this issue later. It is not uncommon to let the vocabulary of classical quantificational logic include 0-place predicates, which are treated as propositional letters. This approach makes propositional logic a proper fragment of classical quantificational logic allowing one to subsume propositional quantification as a species of second-order quantification, i.e., quantification into the position of a 0-place predicate. Or we may supplement the language of propositional logic with a propositional quantifier, \(\forall\), which is allowed to bind propositional letters such as \(p\), \(q\), \(r\), …. This is, for example, the course of action taken by Prior (1971), who outlines a system of propositional quantification. Prior insisted that propositional quantification should not be confused with either objectual quantification over propositions or substitutional quantification over sentences. Rather, propositional quantification is a species of non-nominal quantification, since it is quantification into sentence position. The vocabulary of quantified propositional logic contains propositional letters \(p\), \(q\), \(r\), \(p_1\), … and propositional connectives \(\neg, \rightarrow, \wedge, \vee, \leftrightarrow\). We may as usual treat \(\neg\) and \(\rightarrow\) as primitive and take the others as defined. The usual recursive definition of a formula for propositional logic is appropriately supplemented with a clause that states that \(\forall p \ A\) is a formula whenever \(A\) is a formula. The axioms for propositional quantification are direct counterparts of \((\forall 1)-(\forall 3)\). Call a sentence \(B\) free for a propositional variable \(p\) in \(A\) if, and only if, no free occurrences of \(p\) lies within the scope of a quantification on \(q\), \(\forall q\) or \(\exists q\), where \(q\) is a propositional variable which occurs in \(B\). Now: For a taste of what they can do, notice that they yield a succinct justification of a rule of Uniform Substitution, whereby a formula of the form \(A(B/p)\) is a theorem whenever \(A\) is a theorem, provided that \(B\) is free for \(p\) in \(A\). So, for example, if \(p\rightarrow (q \rightarrow p)\) is a theorem, then \(\neg r \rightarrow (q \rightarrow \neg r)\) is likewise a theorem, since this last formula is just \(p\rightarrow (q \rightarrow p)(\neg  r/p)\).[14] The axioms are now able to deliver every instance of the following comprehension schema: This is one important difference with respect to second-order quantification generally, since we could not automatically derive every instance of second-order comprehension from the other quantificational axioms. Propositional quantification has been used in order to present a deflationary theory of truth. Grover, Camp, & Belnap (1975) and Grover (1992) have, for example, proposed to make use of propositional quantification in order to provide a variation on Ramsey’s redundancy theory of truth. The main claim they make is that we can conceive of phrases like “that is true” or “it is true” as protosentences, which are supposed to stand to sentences as pronouns stand to nouns; unlike pronouns like “it”, protosentences occupy sentence position, but just like pronouns may be used for purposes of cross-reference to earlier nouns, protosentences may be used for purposes of cross-reference to sentences uttered earlier in a conversation. Thus phrases like “that is true” or “it is true” are akin to propositional variables, which may be bound by propositional quantifiers. Prior (1961) makes use of propositional quantification in order to provide an intensional version of the Liar Paradox. In particular, if \(T\) is a sentential operator of the appropriate sort, then the following is a consequence of the axioms for propositional quantification: If we take \(T\) as Prior did, to stand for the sentential operator “It is said by a Cretan that”, then we may read the theorem as the claim that if it is said by a Cretan that whatever is said by a Cretan is not the case, then there are at least two things said by a Cretan. So, quite surprisingly, it is inconsistent to assume that the only thing said by a Cretan is that whatever is said by a Cretan is not the case. Kaplan (1995) makes use of a different observation to raise a problem for the standard model theory for quantified propositional modal logic. He observed, in particular, that if \(Q\) is a sentential operator of the appropriate sort, then the following sentence is not satisfiable in any possible worlds model \(\langle W, \mathcal{I} \rangle\) consisting of a set of possible worlds \(W\) and an interpretation function, \(\mathcal{I}\) assigning a set of sets of possible worlds to the sentential operator: When we let the propositional quantifier range over sets of worlds in \(W\), we find that Kaplan’s sentence can only be satisfied in such a model if there is a map from the set of sets of worlds in \(W\) into \(W\), which is not possible on account of Cantor’s theorem. Kaplan thought this is a problem because the model theory for quantified propositional model should not unduly constrain the space of intuitive possibilities. If we interpret \(Qp\) to mean that \(p\) is Queried, i.e., it is asked whether it is the case that \(p\), then (A) merely states that for every proposition, \(p\), it is possible that \(p\) and only \(p\) is Queried. The two results are not unrelated. Prior’s theorem provides a witness to the claim that some propositions cannot be Queried uniquely. If the proposition expressed by the condition \(\forall p(Qp\rightarrow \neg p)\) is the only proposition that is Queried, then it is true if and only if it is false. So, it can only be Queried if it is false. But it is false only if something true is  Queried.[15] Propositional quantification made an early appearance in Lewis, Langford, & Lamprecht 1932, which is commonly acknowledged to have pioneered the study of modal logic. They outlined a formal system of modal logic with propositional quantification, which they used to formulate an Existence Postulate designed to guarantee the existence of at least two propositions that are consistent and independent from each other. (This is postulate B9 in the entry on the  modern origins of modal logic.)  They used the postulate to make sure strict implication did not collapse into material  implication.[16] Kripke (1959), Fine (1970), and Kaplan (1970) went on to consider systems of propositional modal logic supplemented with propositional quantifiers governed by appropriate axioms and rules of inference. Moreover, they explained how to generalize the Kripkean model theory for propositional modal logic in order to accommodate the presence of propositional quantification. A Kripke model for the language of propositional modal logic is an ordered triple, \(\langle W, R, \mathcal{I} \rangle\), in which \(W\) is a non-empty set of worlds, \(R\) is a binary relation on \(W\), and \(\mathcal{I}\) is an interpretation function, which can be taken to assign a set of possible worlds to each sentence letter in the language. This suggests we interpret propositional quantification in terms of quantification over sets of worlds in \(W\). An assignment of values to the propositional variables \(s\) will map each propositional variable into a set of worlds, and we define satisfaction at a world by an assignment \(s\) as usual, except for an appropriate clause for the quantifier: \(\forall p \ A\) is satisfied at a world \(w\) in \(W\) in \(\langle W, R, \mathcal{I} \rangle\) by assignment \(s\) if, and only if, \(A\) is satisfied at \(w\) by every assignment \(s[p/S]\) in which \(S\) is a subset of \(W\). The definitions of truth at a world and truth in a Kripke model then proceed as usual. The axioms for propositional quantification are sound with respect to the class of extended Kripke models for quantified propositional modal logic. Unfortunately, they are not complete with respect to the same class, since they do not allow us to derive the following as a theorem: However, this formula is valid in every extended Kripke model for the simple reason that its truth at a world in a model only requires the existence of a maximally specific proposition, one which is true at exactly one world. The question fits what should by now be a familiar pattern. Should propositional quantification be taken at face value? Or should it be assimilated to objectual quantification over propositions or maybe substitutional quantification over sentences? One may be tempted by the first option by reflecting on what we did above. We expanded the language of propositional modal logic with a new style of quantification, but the model theory explained the truth conditions associated with the propositional quantifier, \(\forall p \ A\), in terms of objectual quantification over sets of worlds in the model. But this is not to commit to the claim that propositional quantification is to be reduced to objectual quantification over sets of propositions or sets of possible worlds or what have you. The question of how to develop an appropriate model theory for the language of quantified propositional logic is no substitute for the more substantive question of whether there is an intelligible interpretation of propositional quantification on which it is not construed as objectual quantification over propositions or substitutional quantification over sentences. While Prior (1971) and Grover (1972), for example, take propositional quantification to be importantly different from objectual and substitutional quantification, Richard (1996) suggests that propositional quantification should at the end of the day be treated as a species of objectual quantification, e.g., objectual quantification over propositions.
