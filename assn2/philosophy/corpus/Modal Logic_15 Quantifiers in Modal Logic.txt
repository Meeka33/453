 It would seem to be a simple matter to outfit a modal logic with the quantifiers \(\forall\) (all) and \(\exists\) (some). One would simply add the standard (or classical) rules for quantifiers to the principles of whichever propositional modal logic one chooses. However, adding quantifiers to modal logic involves a number of difficulties. Some of these are philosophical. For example, Quine (1953) has famously argued that quantifying into modal contexts is simply incoherent, a view that has spawned a gigantic literature. Quine’s complaints do not carry the weight they once did. See Barcan (1990) for a good summary, and note Kripke’s (2017) (written in the 60’s for a class with Quine) which provides a strong formal argument that there can be nothing wrong with “quantifying in”. A second kind of complication is technical. There is a wide variety in the choices one can make in the semantics for quantified modal logic, and the proof that a system of rules is correct for a given choice can be difficult. The work of Corsi (2002) and Garson (2005) goes some way towards bringing unity to this terrain, and Johannesson (2018) introduces constraints that help reduce the number of options; nevertheless the situation still remains challenging. Another complication is that some logicians believe that modality requires abandoning classical quantifier rules in favor of the weaker rules of free logic (Garson 2001). The main points of disagreement concerning the quantifier rules can be traced back to decisions about how to handle the domain of quantification. The simplest alternative, the fixed-domain (sometimes called the possibilist) approach, assumes a single domain of quantification that contains all the possible objects. On the other hand, the world-relative (or actualist) interpretation, assumes that the domain of quantification changes from world to world, and contains only the objects that actually exist in a given world. The fixed-domain approach requires no major adjustments to the classical machinery for the quantifiers. Modal logics that are adequate for fixed domain semantics can usually be axiomatized by adding principles of a propositional modal logic to classical quantifier rules together with the Barcan Formula \((BF)\) (Barcan 1946). (For an account of some interesting exceptions see Cresswell (1995)). The fixed-domain interpretation has advantages of simplicity and familiarity, but it does not provide a direct account of the semantics of certain quantifier expressions of natural language. We do not think that ‘Some man exists who signed the Declaration of Independence’ is true, at least not if we read ‘exists’ in the present tense. Nevertheless, this sentence was true in 1777, which shows that the domain for the natural language expression ‘some man exists who’ changes to reflect which men exist at different times. A related problem is that on the fixed-domain interpretation, the sentence \(\forall y\Box \exists x(x=y)\) is valid. Assuming that \(\exists x(x=y)\) is read: \(y\) exists, \(\forall y\Box \exists x(x=y)\) says that everything exists necessarily. However, it seems a fundamental feature of common ideas about modality that the existence of many things is contingent, and that different objects exist in different possible worlds. The defender of the fixed-domain interpretation may respond to these objections by insisting that on his (her) reading of the quantifiers, the domain of quantification contains all possible objects, not just the objects that happen to exist at a given world. So the theorem \(\forall y\Box \exists x(x=y)\) makes the innocuous claim that every possible object is necessarily found in the domain of all possible objects. Furthermore, those quantifier expressions of natural language whose domain is world (or time) dependent can be expressed using the fixed-domain quantifier \(\exists x\) and a predicate letter \(E\) with the reading ‘actually exists’. For example, instead of translating ‘Some \(M\)an exists who \(S\)igned the Declaration of Independence’ by the defender of fixed domains may write: thus ensuring the translation is counted false at the present time. Cresswell (1991) makes the interesting observation that world-relative quantification has limited expressive power relative to fixed-domain quantification. World-relative quantification can be defined with fixed domain quantifiers and \(E\), but there is no way to fully express fixed-domain quantifiers with world-relative ones. Although this argues in favor of the classical approach to quantified modal logic, the translation tactic also amounts to something of a concession in favor of free logic, for the world-relative quantifiers so defined obey exactly the free logic rules. A problem with the translation strategy used by defenders of fixed domain quantification is that rendering the English into logic is less direct, since \(E\) must be added to all translations of all sentences whose quantifier expressions have domains that are context dependent. A more serious objection to fixed-domain quantification is that it strips the quantifier of a role which Quine recommended for it, namely to record robust ontological commitment. On this view, the domain of \(\exists x\) must contain only entities that are ontologically respectable, and possible objects are too abstract to qualify. Actualists of this stripe will want to develop the logic of a quantifier \(\exists x\) which reflects commitment to what is actual in a given world rather than to what is merely possible. However, some work on  actualism (Menzel, 1990)  tends to undermine this objection. For example, Linsky and Zalta (1994) and Williamson, (2013) argue that the fixed-domain quantifier can be given an interpretation that is perfectly acceptable to actualists. Pavone (2018) even contends that on the haecceitist interpretation, which quantifies over individual essences, fixed domains are required. Actualists who employ possible worlds semantics routinely quantify over possible worlds in their semantical theory of language. So it would seem that possible worlds are actual by these actualist’s lights. By populating the domain with abstract entities no more objectionable than possible worlds, actualists may vindicate the Barcan Formula and classical principles. Note however, that some actualists may respond that they need not be committed to the actuality of possible worlds so long as it is understood that quantifiers used in their theory of language lack strong ontological import. Furthermore, Hayaki (2006) argues that quantifying over abstract entities is actually incompatible with any serious form of actualism. In any case, it is open to actualists (and non actualists as well) to investigate the logic of quantifiers with more robust domains, for example domains excluding possible worlds and other such abstract entities, and containing only the spatio-temporal particulars found in a given world. For quantifiers of this kind, a world-relative domains are appropriate. Such considerations motivate interest in systems that acknowledge the context dependence of quantification by introducing world-relative domains. Here each possible world has its own domain of quantification (the set of objects that actually exist in that world), and the domains vary from one world to the next. When this decision is made, a difficulty arises for classical quantification theory. Notice that the sentence \(\exists x(x=t)\) is a theorem of classical logic, and so \(\Box \exists x(x=t)\) is a theorem of \(\bK\) by the Necessitation Rule. Let the term \(t\) stand for Saul Kripke. Then this theorem says that it is necessary that Saul Kripke exists, so that he is in the domain of every possible world. The whole motivation for the world-relative approach was to reflect the idea that objects in one world may fail to exist in another. If standard quantifier rulers are used, however, every term \(t\) must refer to something that exists in all the possible worlds. This seems incompatible with our ordinary practice of using terms to refer to things that only exist contingently. One response to this difficulty is simply to eliminate terms. Kripke (1963) gives an example of a system that uses the world-relative interpretation and preserves the classical rules. However, the costs are severe. First, his language is artificially impoverished, and second, the rules for the propositional modal logic must be weakened. Presuming that we would like a language that includes terms, and that classical rules are to be added to standard systems of propositional modal logic, a new problem arises. In such a system, it is possible to prove \((CBF)\), the converse of the Barcan Formula. This fact has serious consequences for the system’s semantics. It is not difficult to show that every world-relative model of \((CBF)\) must meet condition \((ND)\) (for ‘nested domains’). However \((ND)\) conflicts with the point of introducing world-relative domains. The whole idea was that existence of objects is contingent so that there are accessible possible worlds where one of the things in our world fails to exist. A straightforward solution to these problems is to abandon classical rules for the quantifiers and to adopt rules for free logic \((\mathbf{FL})\) instead. The rules of \(\mathbf{FL}\) are the same as the classical rules, except that inferences from \(\forall xRx\) (everything is real) to \(Rp\) (Pegasus is real) are blocked. This is done by introducing a predicate ‘\(E\)’ (for ‘actually exists’) and modifying the rule of universal instantiation. From \(\forall xRx\) one is allowed to obtain \(Rp\) only if one also has obtained \(Ep\). Assuming that the universal quantifier \(\forall x\) is primitive, and the existential quantifier \(\exists x\) is defined by \(\exists xA =_{df} {\sim}\forall x{\sim}A\), then \(\mathbf{FL}\) may be constructed by adding the following two principles to the rules of propositional logic Universal Generalization. If \(B\rightarrow(Ey\rightarrow A(y))\) is a theorem, so is \(B\rightarrow \forall xA(x)\). Universal Instantiation. \(\forall xA(x)\rightarrow(En\rightarrow A(n))\) (Here it is assumed that \(A(x)\) is any well-formed formula of predicate logic, and that \(A(y)\) and \(A(n)\) result from replacing \(y\) and \(n\) properly for each occurrence of \(x\) in \(A(x)\).) Note that the instantiation axiom is restricted by mention of \(En\) in the antecedent. The rule of Universial Generalization is modified in the same way. In \(\mathbf{FL}\), proofs of formulas like \(\exists x\Box(x=t)\), \(\forall y\Box \exists x(x=y)\), \((CBF)\), and \((BF)\), which seem incompatible with the world-relative interpretation, are blocked. One philosophical objection to \(\mathbf{FL}\) is that \(E\) appears to be an existence predicate, and many would argue that existence is not a legitimate property like being green or weighing more than four pounds. So philosophers who reject the idea that existence is a predicate may object to \(\mathbf{FL}\). However in most (but not all) quantified modal logics that include identity \((=)\) these worries may be skirted by defining \(E\) as follows. The most general way to formulate quantified modal logic is to create \(\mathbf{FS}\) by adding the rules of \(\mathbf{FL}\) to a given propositional modal logic \(\mathbf{S}\). In situations where classical quantification is desired, one may simply add \(Et\) as an axiom to \(\mathbf{FS}\), so that the classical principles become derivable rules. Adequacy results for such systems can be obtained for most choices of the modal logic \(\mathbf{S}\), but there are exceptions. A final complication in the semantics for quantified modal logic is worth mentioning. It arises when non-rigid expressions such as ‘the inventor of bifocals’ are introduced to the language. A term is non-rigid when it picks out different objects in different possible worlds. The semantical value of such a term can be given by what Carnap (1947) called an individual concept, a function that picks out the denotation of the term for each possible world. One approach to dealing with non-rigid terms is to employ Russell’s theory of descriptions. However, in a language that treats non rigid expressions as genuine terms, it turns out that neither the classical nor the free logic rules for the quantifiers are acceptable. (The problem can not be resolved by weakening the rule of substitution for identity.) A solution to this problem is to employ a more general treatment of the quantifiers, where the domain of quantification contains individual concepts rather than objects. This more general interpretation provides a better match between the treatment of terms and the treatment of quantifiers and results in systems that are adequate for classical or free logic rules (depending on whether the fixed domains or world-relative domains are chosen). It also provides a language with strong and much needed expressive powers (Bressan, 1973, Belnap and Müller, 2013a, 2013b).
