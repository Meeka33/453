 A number of philosophers have suggested that what is distinctive of logical constants is their insensitivity to the particular identities of objects, or, more precisely, their invariance under arbitrary permutations of the domain of objects (Mautner 1946; Mostowski 1957, 13; Scott 1970, 160–161; McCarthy 1981, 1987; Tarski 1986; van Benthem 1989; Sher 1991, 1996; McGee 1996). Let us unpack that phrase a bit. A permutation of a collection of objects is a one-one mapping from that collection onto itself. Each object gets mapped to an object in the collection (possibly itself), and no two objects are mapped to the same object. For example, the following mapping is a permutation of the first five letters of the alphabet: And the function \(f(x) = x + 1\) is a permutation of the set of integers onto itself. (Note, however, that a permutation need not be specifiable either by enumeration, as in our first example, or by a rule, as in our second.) The extension of a predicate is invariant under a permutation of the domain if replacing each of its members with the object to which the permutation maps it leaves us with the same set we started with.  Thus, for example, the extension of “is a letter between \(\textrm{A}\) and \(\textrm{E}\)” is invariant under the permutation of letters described above. By contrast, the extension of “is a vowel between \(\textrm{A}\) and \(\textrm{E}\)”, the set \(\{\textrm{A}, \textrm{E}\}\), is not invariant under this permutation, which transforms it to a different set, \(\{\textrm{C}, \textrm{D}\}\). We can make the notion of permutation invariance more precise as follows. Given a permutation \(p\) of objects on a domain \(D\), we define a transformation \(p^*\) of arbitrary types in the hierarchy: These clauses can be applied recursively to define transformations of sets of ordered tuples in \(D\) (the extensions of two-place predicates), sets of sets of objects in \(D\) (the extensions of unary first-order quantifiers), and so on. (For an introduction to the type theoretic hierachy, see the entry on Type Theory.) Where \(x\) is an item in this hierarchy, we say that \(x\) is invariant under a permutation \(p\) just in case \(p^*(x) = x\). To return to our example above, the set  \(\{\textrm{A}, \textrm{B}, \textrm{C}, \textrm{D}, \textrm{E}\}\) is invariant under all permutations of the letters \(\textrm{A}\) through \(\textrm{E}\): no matter how we switch these letters around, we end up with the same set.  But it is not invariant under all permutations of the entire alphabet.  For example, the permutation that switches the letters \(\textrm{A}\) and \(\textrm{Z}\), mapping all the other letters to themselves, transforms  \(\{\textrm{A}, \textrm{B}, \textrm{C}, \textrm{D}, \textrm{E}\}\) to  \(\{\textrm{Z}, \textrm{B}, \textrm{C}, \textrm{D}, \textrm{E}\}\).  The set containing all the letters, however, is invariant under all permutations of letters.  So is the set of all sets containing at least two letters, and the relation of identity, which holds between each letter and itself. So far we have defined permutation invariance for objects, tuples, and sets, but not for predicates, quantifiers, or other linguistic expressions. But it is the latter, not the former, that we need to sort into logical and nonlogical constants. The natural thought is that an expression should count as permutation-invariant just in case its extension on each domain of objects is invariant under all permutations of that domain. (As usual, the extension of a name on a domain is the object it denotes, the extension of a monadic predicate is the set of objects in the domain to which it applies, and the extension of an \(n\)-adic predicate is the set of \(n\)-tuples of objects in the domain to which it applies.) As it stands, this definition does not apply to sentential connectives, which do not have extensions in the usual  sense,[10]  but it can be extended to cover them in a natural way (following McGee 1996, 569). We can think of the semantic value of an \(n\)-ary quantifier or sentential connective \(C\) on a domain \(D\) as a function from \(n\)-tuples of sets of assignments (of values from \(D\) to the language’s variables) to sets of assignments. Where the input to the function is the \(n\)-tuple of sets of assignments that satisfy \(\phi_1, \dots, \phi_n\), its output is the set of assignments that satisfies \(C\phi_1 \dots \phi_n\). (Check your understanding by thinking about how this works for the unary connective \(\exists x\).) We can then define permutation invariance for these semantic values as follows. Where \(A\) is a set of assignments and \(p\) is a permutation of a domain \(D\), let \(p^\dagger(A) = \{ p \circ a : a \in A\}\).[11]  Then if \(e\) is the semantic value of an \(n\)-place connective or quantifier (in the sense defined above), \(e\) is invariant under a permutation \(p\) just in case for any \(n\)-tuple \(\langle A_1, \dots, A_n \rangle\) of sets of assignments, \(p^\dagger (e(\langle A_1, \dots, A_n\rangle)) = e(\langle p^\dagger (A_1), \dots, p^\dagger (A_n)\rangle\)). And a connective or quantifier is permutation-invariant just in case its semantic value on each domain of objects is invariant under all permutations of that domain. It turns out that this condition does not quite suffice to weed out all sensitivity to particular features of objects, for it allows that a permutation-invariant constant might behave differently on domains containing different kinds of objects. McGee (1996, 575) gives the delightful example of wombat disjunction, which behaves like disjunction if the domain contains wombats and like conjunction otherwise. Sher’s fix, and McGee’s, is to consider not just permutations—bijections of the domain onto itself—but arbitrary bijections of the domain onto another domain of equal  cardinality.[12]  For simplicity, we will ignore this complication in what follows and continue to talk of permutations. Which expressions get counted as logical constants, on this criterion? The monadic predicates “is a thing” (which applies to everything) and “is not anything” (which applies to nothing), the identity predicate, the truth-functional connectives, and the standard existential and universal quantifiers all pass the test. So do the standard first-order binary quantifiers like “most” and “the” (see  the entry on   descriptions).  Indeed, because cardinality is permutation-invariant, every cardinality quantifier is included, including “there are infinitely many”, “there are uncountably many”, and others that are not first-order definable. Moreover, the second-order quantifiers count as logical (at least on the standard semantics, in which they range over arbitrary subsets of the domain), as do all higher-order quantifiers. On the other hand, all proper names are excluded, as are the predicates “red”, “horse”, “is a successor of”, and “is a member of”, as well as the quantifiers “some dogs” and “exactly two natural numbers”. So the invariance criterion seems to accord at least partially with common intuitions about logicality or topic neutrality, and with our logical practice. Two technical results allow us to be a bit more precise about the extent of this accord: Lindenbaum and Tarski (1934–5) show that all of the relations definable in the language of Principia Mathematica are permutation-invariant. Moving in the other direction, McGee (1996) shows that every permutation-invariant operation can be defined in terms of operations with an intuitively logical character (identity, substitution of variables, finite or infinite disjunction, negation, and finite or infinite existential quantification). He also generalizes the Lindenbaum-Tarski result by showing that every operation so definable is permutation invariant. As Tarski and others have pointed out, the permutation invariance criterion for logical constants can be seen as a natural generalization of Felix Klein’s (1893) idea that different geometries can be distinguished by the groups of transformations under which their basic notions are invariant. Thus, for example, the notions of Euclidean geometry are invariant under similarity transformations, those of affine geometry under affine transformations, and those of topology under bicontinuous transformations. In the same way, Tarski suggests (1986, 149), the logical notions are just those that are invariant under the widest possible group of transformations: the group of permutations of the elements in the domain. Seen in this way, the logical notions are the end point of a chain of progressively more abstract, “formal,” or topic-neutral notions defined by their invariance under progressively wider groups of transformations of a domain.[13] As an account of the distinctive generality of logic, then, permutation invariance has much to recommend it. It is philosophically well-motivated and mathematically precise, it yields results that accord with common practice, and it gives determinate rulings about some borderline cases (for example, set-theoretic membership). Best of all, it offers hope for a sharp and principled demarcation of logic that avoids cloudy epistemic and semantic terms like “about”, “analytic”, and “a  priori”.[14] A limitation of the permutation invariance criterion (as it has been stated so far) is that it applies only to extensional operators and connectives. It is therefore of no help in deciding, for instance, whether the necessity operator in S4 modal logic or the H operator (“it has always been the case that”) in temporal logic are bona fide logical constants, and these are among the questions that we wanted a criterion to resolve. However, the invariance criterion can be extended in a natural way to intensional operators. The usual strategy for handling such operators semantically is to relativize truth not just to an assignment of values to variables, but also to a possible world and a time. In such a framework, one might demand that logical constants be insensitive not just to permutations of the domain of objects, but to permutations of the domain of possible worlds and the domain of times (see Scott 1970, 161, McCarthy 1981, 511–13, van Benthem 1989, 334). The resulting criterion is fairly stringent: it counts the S5 necessity operator as a logical constant, but not the S4 necessity operator or the H operator in temporal logic. The reason is that the latter two operators are sensitive to structure on the domains of worlds and times—the “accessibility relation” in the former case, the relation of temporal ordering in the latter—and this structure is not preserved by all permutations of these  domains.[15]  (See the entries on   modal logic  and  temporal logic.) One might avoid this consequence by requiring only invariance under permutations that preserve the relevant structure on these domains (accessibility relations, temporal ordering). But one would then be faced with the task of explaining why this structure deserves special treatment (cf. van Benthem 1989, 334). And if we are allowed to keep some structure on the domain of worlds or times fixed, the question immediately arises why we should not also keep some structure on the domain of objects fixed: for example, the set-theoretic membership relation, the mereological part/whole relation, or the distinction between existent and nonexistent objects (see the entry on free logics). Whatever resources we appeal to in answering this question will be doing at least as much work as permutation invariance in the resulting demarcation of logical constants. It may seem that the only principled position is to demand invariance under all permutations. But even that position needs justification, especially when one sees that it is possible to formulate even stricter invariance conditions. Feferman (1999) defines a “similarity invariance” criterion that counts the truth-functional operators and first-order existential and universal quantifiers as logical constants, but not identity, the first-order cardinality quantifiers, or the second-order quantifiers. Feferman’s criterion draws the line between logic and mathematics much closer to the traditional boundary than the permutation invariance criterion does. Indeed, one of Feferman’s criticisms of the permutation invariance criterion is that it allows too many properly mathematical notions to be expressed in purely logical terms.  Bonnay (2008) argues for a different criterion, invariance under potential isomorphism, which counts finite cardinality quantifiers and the notion of finiteness as logical, while excluding the higher cardinality quantifiers—thus “[setting] the boundary between logic and mathematics somewhere between arithmetic and set theory” (37; see Feferman 2010, §6, for further discussion). Feferman (2010) suggests that instead of relying solely on invariance, we might combine invariance under permutations with a separate absoluteness requirement, which captures the insensitivity of logic to controversial set-theoretic theses like axioms of infinity.  He shows that the logical operations that are both permutation-invariant and absolutely definable with respect to Kripke–Platek set theory without an axiom of infinity are just those definable in first-order logic. There is another problem that afflicts any attempt to demarcate the logical constants by appeal to mathematical properties like invariance. As McCarthy puts it: “the logical status of an expression is not settled by the functions it introduces, independently of how these functions are specified” (1981, 516). Consider a two-place predicate \(\dq{\approx}\), whose meaning is given by the following definition: According to the invariance criterion, \(\dq{\approx}\) is a logical constant just in case its extension on every domain is invariant under every permutation of that domain. On a domain \(D\) containing no two objects with exactly the same mass, \(\dq{\approx}\) has the same extension as \(\dq{=}\)—the set \(\{ \langle x, x \rangle : x \in D\}\)—and as we have seen, this extension is invariant under every permutation of the domain. Hence, if there is no domain containing two objects with exactly the same mass, \(\dq{\approx}\) counts as a logical constant, and \(\dq{\forall x (x \approx x)}\) as a logical truth.[16] But it seems odd that the logical status of \(\dq{\approx}\) and \(\dq{\forall x (x \approx x)}\) should depend on a matter of contingent fact: whether there are distinct objects with identical mass. Do we really want to say that if we lived in a world in which no two objects had the same mass, \(\dq{\approx}\) would be a logical  constant?[17] A natural response to this kind of objection would be to require that the extension of a logical constant on every possible domain of objects be invariant under every permutation of that domain, or, more generally, that a logical constant satisfy the permutation invariance criterion as a matter of necessity. But this would not get to the root of the problem. For consider the unary connective \(\dq{\#}\), defined by the clause Assuming that Kripke (1971; 1980) is right that water is necessarily H2O, \(\dq{\#}\) has the same extension as \(\dq{\neg}\) in every possible world, and so satisfies the permutation invariance criterion as a matter of necessity (McGee 1996, 578). But intuitively, it does not seem that \(\dq{\#}\) should be counted a logical  constant.[18] One might evade this counterexample by appealing to an epistemic modality instead of a metaphysical one. This is McCarthy’s strategy (1987, 439). Even if it is metaphysically necessary that water is H2O, there are presumably epistemically possible worlds, or information states, in which water is not H2O. So if we require that a logical constant be permutation invariant as a matter of epistemic necessity (or a priori), \(\dq{\#}\) does not count as a logical constant. But even on this version of the criterion, a connective like \(\dq{\%}\), defined by would count as a logical constant (Gómez-Torrente 2002, 21), assuming that it is epistemically necessary that there are no male widows. It may be tempting to solve this problem by appealing to a distinctively logical modality—requiring, for example, that logical constants have permutation-invariant extensions as a matter of logical necessity. But we would then be explicating the notion of a logical constant in terms of an obscure primitive notion of logical necessity which we could not, on pain of circularity, explicate by reference to logical constants. (McCarthy 1998, §3 appeals explicitly to logical possibility and notices the threat of circularity here.) McGee’s strategy is to invoke semantic notions instead of modal ones: he suggests that “[a] connective is a logical connective if and only if it follows from the meaning of the connective that it is invariant under arbitrary bijections” (McGee 1996, 578). But this approach, like McCarthy’s, seems to count \(\dq{\%}\) as a logical constant. And, like McCarthy’s, it requires appeal to a notion that does not seem any clearer than the notion of a logical constant: the notion of following (logically?) from the meaning of the connective. Sher’s response to the objection is radically different from McGee’s or McCarthy’s. She suggests that “logical terms are identified with their (actual) extensions,” so that \(\dq{\#}\), \(\dq{\%}\), and \(\dq{\neg}\) are just different notations for the same term. More precisely: if these expressions are used the way a logical constant must be used—as rigid  designators[19]  of their semantic values—then they can be identified with the operation of Boolean negation and hence with each other. “Qua quantifiers, ‘the number of planets’ and ‘9’ are indistinguishable” (Sher 1991, 64). But it is not clear what Sher can mean when she says that logical terms can be identified with their extensions. We normally individuate connectives intentionally, by the conditions for grasping them or the rules for their use, and not by the truth functions they express. For example, we recognize a difference between \(\dq{\and}\), defined by and \(\dq{@}\), defined by even though they express the same truth function. The distinction between these terms is not erased, as Sher seems to suggest, if we use them as rigid designators for the truth functions they express. (That “Hesperus”, “Phosphorus”, and “the planet I actually saw near the horizon on the morning of November 1, 2004” all rigidly designate Venus does not entail that they have the same meaning.) Thus Sher’s proposal can only be understood as a stipulation that if one of a pair of coreferential rigid designators counts as a logical constant, the other does too. But it is not clear why we should accept this stipulation. It certainly has some counterintuitive consequences: for example, that \(\dq{P \vee \#P}\) is a logical truth, at least when \(\dq{\#}\) is used rigidly (see Gómez-Torrente 2002, 19, and the response in Sher 2003). It is hard not to conclude from these discussions that the permutation invariance criterion gives at best a necessary condition for logical constancy. Its main shortcoming is that it operates at the level of reference rather than the level of sense; it looks at the logical operations expressed by the constants, but not at their meanings. An adequate criterion, one might therefore expect, would operate at the level of sense, perhaps attending to the way we grasp the meanings of logical constants.
