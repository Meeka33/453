 From Cantor and until about 1940, set theory developed mostly around the study of the continuum, that is, the real line \(\mathbb{R}\). The main topic was the study of the so-called regularity properties, as well as other structural properties, of simply-definable sets of real numbers, an area of mathematics that is known as Descriptive Set Theory. Descriptive Set Theory is the study of the properties and structure of definable sets of real numbers and, more generally, of definable subsets of \(\mathbb{R}^n\) and other Polish spaces (i.e., topological spaces that are homeomorphic to a separable complete metric space), such as the Baire space \(\mathcal{N}\) of all functions \(f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\), the space of complex numbers, Hilbert space, and separable Banach spaces. The simplest sets of real numbers are the basic open sets (i.e., the open intervals with rational endpoints), and their complements. The sets that are obtained in a countable number of steps by starting from the basic open sets and applying the operations of taking the complement and forming a countable union of previously obtained sets are the Borel sets. All Borel sets are regular, that is, they enjoy all the classical regularity properties. One example of a regularity property is the Lebesgue measurability: a set of reals is Lebesgue measurable if it differs from a Borel set by a null set, namely, a set that can be covered by sets of basic open intervals of arbitrarily-small total length. Thus, trivially, every Borel set is Lebesgue measurable, but sets more complicated than the Borel ones may not be. Other classical regularity properties are the Baire property (a set of reals has the Baire property if it differs from an open set by a meager set, namely, a set that is a countable union of sets that are not dense in any interval), and the perfect set property (a set of reals has the perfect set property if it is either countable or contains a perfect set, namely, a nonempty closed set with no isolated points). In ZFC one can prove that there exist non-regular sets of reals, but the AC is necessary for this (Solovay 1970). The analytic sets, also called \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_1\), are the continuous images of Borel sets. And the co-analytic, or \(\mathbf{\Pi}^1_1\), sets are the complements of analytic sets. Starting from the analytic (or the co-analytic) sets and applying the operations of projection (from the product space \(\mathbb{R}\times \mathcal{N}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\)) and complementation, one obtains the projective sets. The projective sets form a hierarchy of increasing complexity. For example, if \(A\subseteq \mathbb{R}\times \mathcal{N}\) is co-analytic, then the projection \(\{ x\in \mathbb{R}: \exists y\in \mathcal{N}((x,y)\in A)\}\) is a projective set in the next level of complexity above the co-analytic sets. Those sets are called \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2\), and their complements are called \(\mathbf{\Pi}^1_2\). The projective sets come up very naturally in mathematical practice, for it turns out that a set \(A\) of reals is projective if and only if it is definable in the structure \[\mathcal{R}=(\mathbb{R}, +,\cdot ,\mathbb{Z}).\] That is, there is a first-order formula \(\varphi ( x, y_1,\ldots, y_n)\) in the language for the structure such that for some \(r_1,\ldots ,r_n\in \mathbb{R}\), \[A=\{ x\in \mathbb{R}: \mathcal{R}\models \varphi(x,r_1,\ldots ,r_n)\}.\] ZFC proves that every analytic set, and therefore every co-analytic set, is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also proves that every analytic set has the perfect set property. But the perfect set property for co-analytic sets implies that the first uncountable cardinal, \(\aleph_1\), is a large cardinal in the constructible universe \(L\) (see Section 7), namely a so-called inaccessible cardinal (see  Section 10),  which implies that one cannot prove in ZFC that every co-analytic set has the perfect set property. The theory of projective sets of complexity greater than co-analytic is completely undetermined by ZFC. For example, in \(L\) there is a \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2\) set that is not Lebesgue measurable and does not have the Baire property, whereas if Martin’s axiom holds (see Section 11), every such set has those regularity properties. There is, however, an axiom, called the axiom of Projective Determinacy, or PD, that is consistent with ZFC, modulo the consistency of some large cardinals (in fact, it follows from the existence of some large cardinals), and implies that all projective sets are regular. Moreover, PD settles essentially all questions about the projective sets. See the entry on  large cardinals and determinacy  for further details. A regularity property of sets that subsumes all other classical regularity properties is that of being determined. For simplicity, we shall work with the Baire space \(\mathcal{N}\). Recall that the elements of \(\mathcal{N}\) are functions \(f:\mathbb{N} \to \mathbb{N}\), that is, sequences of natural numbers of length \(\omega\). The space \(\mathcal{N}\) is topologically equivalent (i.e., homeomorphic) to the set of irrational points of \(\mathbb{R}\). So, since we are interested in the regularity properties of subsets of \(\mathbb{R}\), and since countable sets, such as the set of rationals, are negligible in terms of those properties, we may as well work with \(\mathcal{N}\), instead of \(\mathbb{R}\). Given \(A\subseteq \mathcal{N}\), the game associated to \(A\), denoted by \({\mathcal G}_A\), has two players, I and II, who play alternatively \(n_i\in \mathbb{N}\): I plays \(n_0\), then II plays \(n_1\), then I plays \(n_2\), and so on. So, at stage \(2k\), player I plays \(n_{2k}\) and at stage \(2k+1\), player II plays \(n_{2k+1} \). We may visualize a run of the game as follows: After infinitely many moves, the two players produce an infinite sequence \(n_0, n_1,n_2,\ldots\) of natural numbers. Player I wins the game if the sequence belongs to \(A\). Otherwise, player II wins. The game \({\mathcal{G}}_A\) is determined if there is a winning strategy for one of the players. A winning strategy for one of the players, say for player II, is a function \(\sigma\) from the set of finite sequences of natural numbers into \(\mathbb{N}\), such that if the player plays according to this function, i.e., she plays \(\sigma (n_0,\ldots ,n_{2k})\) at the \(k\)-th turn, she will always win the game, no matter what the other player does. We say that a subset \(A\) of \(\mathcal{N}\) is determined if and only if the game \({\mathcal{G}}_A\) is determined. One can prove in ZFC—and the use of the AC is necessary—that there are non-determined sets. Thus, the Axiom of Determinacy (AD), which asserts that all subsets of \(\mathcal{N}\) are determined, is incompatible with the AC. But Donald Martin proved, in ZFC, that every Borel set is determined. Further, he showed that if there exists a large cardinal called measurable (see  Section 10), then even the analytic sets are determined. The axiom of Projective Determinacy (PD) asserts that every projective set is determined. It turns out that PD implies that all projective sets of reals are regular, and Woodin has shown that, in a certain sense, PD settles essentially all questions about the projective sets. Moreover, PD seems to be necessary for this. Another axiom, \(AD^{L(\Bbb R )}\), asserts that the AD holds in \(L(\Bbb R)\), which is the least transitive class that contains all the ordinals and all the real numbers, and satisfies the ZF axioms (see  Section 7). So, \(AD^{L(\Bbb R )}\) implies that every set of reals that belongs to \(L(\Bbb R)\) is regular. Also, since \(L(\Bbb R)\) contains all projective sets, \(AD^{L(\Bbb R )}\) implies PD. The Continuum Hypothesis (CH), formulated by Cantor in 1878, asserts that every infinite set of real numbers has cardinality either \(\aleph_0\) or the same cardinality as \(\mathbb{R}\). Thus, the CH is equivalent to \(2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_1\). Cantor proved in 1883 that closed sets of real numbers have the perfect set property, from which it follows that every uncountable closed set of real numbers has the same cardinality as \(\mathbb{R}\). Thus, the CH holds for closed sets. More than thirty years later, Pavel Aleksandrov extended the result to all Borel sets, and then Mikhail Suslin to all analytic sets. Thus, all analytic sets satisfy the CH. However, the efforts to prove that co-analytic sets satisfy the CH would not succeed, as this is not provable in ZFC. In 1938 Gödel proved the consistency of the CH with ZFC. Assuming that ZF is consistent, he built a model of ZFC, known as the constructible universe, in which the CH holds. Thus, the proof shows that if ZF is consistent, then so is ZF together with the AC and the CH. Hence, assuming ZF is consistent, the AC cannot be disproved in ZF and the CH cannot be disproved in ZFC. See the entry on the  continuum hypothesis  for the current status of the problem, including the latest results by Woodin.
