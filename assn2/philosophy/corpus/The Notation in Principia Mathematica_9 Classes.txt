 The circumflex “ˆ” over a variable preceding a formula is used to indicate a class, thus \(\hat{x} \psi x\) is the class of things \(x\) which are such that \(\psi x\). In modern notation we represent this class as \(\{x \mid \psi x\}\), which is read: the class of \(x\) which are such that \(x\) has \(\psi\). Recall that “\(\phi \hat{x}\)”, with the circumflex over a variable after the predicate variable, expresses the propositional function of being an \(x\) such that \(\phi x\). In the type theory of PM, the class \(\hat{x} \phi x\) has the same logical type as the function \(\phi \hat{x}\). This makes it appropriate to use the following contextual definition, which allows one to eliminate the class term \(\hat{x} \psi x\) from occurrences in the context \(f\):  \[ \tag*{∗20·01}   f\{ \hat{z}(\psi z)\} \ldot {=} \colon (\exists \phi) \colon \phi \bang x \ldot  {\equiv_x} \ldot  \psi x \colon f \{ \phi\bang \hat{z}\}  \quad\Df \]   or in modern notation:   \[ f\{z \mid \psi z\} =_{df} \exists \phi[\forall x(\phi x \equiv \psi x) \amp f(\lambda x \phi x)] \]   where \(\phi\) is a predicative function of \(x\) Note that \(f\) has to be interpreted as a higher-order function which is predicated of the function \(\phi \bang \hat{z}\). In the modern notation used above, the language has to be a typed language in which \(\lambda\) expressions are allowed in argument position. As was pointed out later (Chwistek 1924, Gödel 1944, and Carnap 1947) there should be scope indicators for class expressions just as there are for definite descriptions. Chwistek, for example, proposed copying the notation for definite descriptions, thus replacing ∗20·01 with: Contemporary formalizations of set theory make use of something like these contextual definitions, when they require an “existence” theorem of the form \(\exists x\forall y(y \in x \equiv \ldots y\ldots)\), in order to justify the introduction of a singular term \(\{y \mid \ldots y\ldots \}\). (Given the law of extensionality, it follows from \(\exists x\forall y(y \in x \equiv \ldots y\ldots)\) that there is a unique such set.) The relation of membership in classes \(\in\) is defined in PM by first defining a similar relationship between objects and propositional functions:  \[ \tag*{∗20·02} x \in (\phi\bang \hat{z})  \ldot {=} \ldot  \phi \bang x \quad\Df  \]   or, in modern notation:   \[ x \in \lambda z\phi z =_{df} \phi x \] ∗20·01 and ∗20·02 together are then used to define the more familiar notion of membership in a class. The formal expression “\(y \in \{ \hat{z}(\phi z)\}\)” can now been seen as a context in which the class term occurs; it is then eliminated by the contextual definition ∗20·01. (Exercise) PM also has Greek letters for classes: \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\), etc. These will appear as bound (real) variables, apparent (free) variables and in abstracts for propositional functions true of classes, as in \(\phi \hat{\alpha}\). Only definitions of the bound Greek variables appear in the body of the text, the others are informally defined in the Introduction:   \[ \tag*{∗20·07}   (\alpha) \sdot f \alpha \ldot {=} \ldot  (\phi) \sdot  f \{ \hat{z}(\phi\bang z)\} \quad\Df \]   or, in modern notation,  \[ \forall \alpha\, f\alpha =_{df} \forall \phi f\{z\mid\phi z\} \]   where \(\phi\) is a predicative function. Thus universally quantified class variables are defined in terms of quantifiers ranging over predicative functions. Likewise for existential quantification:   \[ \tag*{∗20·071}   (\exists \alpha) \sdot f \alpha \ldot {=} \ldot  (\exists \phi) \sdot  f \{ \hat{z}(\phi\bang z)\} \quad\Df \]   or, in modern notation,  \[ \exists \alpha\, f\alpha =_{df} \exists \phi f\{z\mid\phi z\} \]   where \(\phi\) is a predicative function. Expressions with a Greek variable to the left of \(\in\) are defined:  \[ \tag*{∗20·081} \alpha \in \psi\bang \hat{\alpha} \ldot {=} \ldot  \psi \bang \alpha  \quad\Df \] These definitions do not cover all possible occurrences of Greek variables. In the Introduction to PM, further definitions of are \(f \alpha\) and \(f \hat{\alpha}\) proposed, but it is remarked that the definitions are in some way peculiar and they do not appear in the body of the work. The definition considered for \(f \hat{\alpha}\) is: or, in modern notation, That is, \(f \hat{\alpha}\) is an expression naming the function which takes a function \(\phi\) to a proposition which asserts \(f\) of the class of \(\phi\)s. (The modern notation shows that in the proposed definition of \(f \hat{\alpha}\) in PM notation, we shouldn’t expect \(\alpha\) in the definiens, since it is really a bound variable in \(f \hat{\alpha}\); similarly, we shouldn’t expect \(\phi\) in the definiendum because it is a bound variable in the definiens.) One might also expect definitions like ∗20·07 and ∗20·071 to hold for cases in which the Roman letter “\(z\)” is replaced by a Greek letter. The definitions in PM are thus not complete, but it is possible to guess at how they would be extended to cover all occurrences of Greek letters. This would complete the project of the “no-classes” theory of classes by showing how all talk of classes can be reduced to the theory of propositional functions.
