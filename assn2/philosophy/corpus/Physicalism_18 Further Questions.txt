 That completes our discussion of physicalism. It is sketchy in certain places, and this suggests that there is much further work to be done before we arrive at a final assessment of the doctrine of physicalism and the role that it plays in contemporary thought. In the future, however, it would seem to me to be a good idea to think at least about the following: (a) The contrast between modal and non-modal definitions of physicalism.  While supervenience, and more generally modal, definitions of physicalism are attractive, they do raise problems of a difficult natureâ€”such as the blockers problem and the sufficiency problem.  At the time of writing it is unclear how these difficulties will be resolved. (b) The relation between, and the adequacy of, the theory-conception and the object-conception of the physical. It seems clear that our thinking about the physical is anchored in part in the ordinary idea of a physical object and in part in the idea of physics. But it seems equally clear that these two ideas can and do come apart. What are the consequences of this for the notion of physicalism? (c) The role of physicalism in philosophy of mind.  As we have seen for both Nagel and Williams questions about physicalism are really questions about objectivity in disguise.  This raises the more general issue of whether arguments and theses in philosophy of mind (and other areas of philosophy) that are formulated in terms of physicalism are necessarily formulated in that way.  Perhaps physicalism here is simply getting in the way of a proper understanding of how these problems work?
