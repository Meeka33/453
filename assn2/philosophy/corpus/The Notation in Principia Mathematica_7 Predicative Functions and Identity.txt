 The exclamation mark “!” following a variable for a function and preceding the argument, as in “\(f\bang \hat{x}\)”, “\(\phi \bang x\)”, “\(\phi\bang \hat{x}\)”, indicates that the function is predicative, that is, of the lowest order which can apply to its arguments. In Church’s notation, this means that predicative functions are all of the first level, with types of the form \((\ldots)/1\). As a result, predicative functions will be of order one more than the highest order of any of their arguments. This analysis is based on quotations like the following, in the Introduction to PM: Unfortunately in the summary of ∗12, we find “A predicative function is one which contains no apparent variables, i.e., is a matrix” [PM, 167]. Reconciling this statement with that definition in the Introduction is a problem for scholars. To see the shriek notation in action, consider the following definition of identity: That is, \(x\) is identical with \(y\) if and only if \(y\) has every predicative function \(\phi\) which is possessed by \(x\). (Of course the second occurrence of “=” indicates a definition, and does not independently have meaning. It is the first occurrence, relating individuals \(x\) and \(y\), which is defined.) To see how this definition reduces to the more familiar definition of identity (on which objects are identical iff they share the same properties), we need the Axiom of Reducibility. The Axiom of Reducibility states that for any function there is an equivalent function (i.e., one true of all the same arguments) which is predicative: To see how this axiom implies the more familiar definition of identity, note that the more familiar definition of identity is: for \(\phi\) of “any” type. (Note that this differs from ∗13·01 in that the shriek no longer appears.) Now to prove this, assume both ∗13·01 and the Axiom of Reducibility, and suppose, for proof by reductio, that \(x = y\), and \(\phi x\), and not \(\phi y\), for some function \(\phi\) of arbitrary type. Then, the Axiom of Reducibility ∗12·1 guarantees that there will be a predicative function \(\psi \bang \), which is coextensive with \(\phi\) such that \(\psi \bang x\) but not \(\psi \bang y\), which contradicts ∗13·01.
