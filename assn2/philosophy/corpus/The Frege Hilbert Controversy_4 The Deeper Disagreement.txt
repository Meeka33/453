 As noted above, Frege views Hilbert’s reinterpretations as involving a shift of attention from geometric thoughts (whose consistency and independence are at issue) to thoughts of a wholly different kind, those about the background theory B (whose consistency and independence are not in question). Regarding consistency proofs, his view is that Hilbert makes an illegitimate inference from the consistency of a collection \(\textit{AX}_{R}\) of thoughts about real numbers to the consistency of a collection \(\textit{AX}_{G}\) of thoughts about geometric points, lines, and planes. Frege acknowledges that Hilbert’s set AX of sentences can be understood as providing an implicit definition of an abstract relation \(R_{\textit{AX}}\), one that is satisfied by Hilbert’s constructed n-tuples, and that the consistency (i.e., satisfiability) of \(\textit{AX}_{R}\) entails the consistency of that defined relation. But here too, Frege takes it that Hilbert’s crucial inference, from the consistency of \(R_{\textit{AX}}\) to the consistency of \(\textit{AX}_{G}\), is problematic. As Frege himself puts it, referring to \(\textit{AX}_{R}\) and \(\textit{AX}_{G}\) as “special geometries”, and to \(R_{\textit{AX}}\) as the “general case:” [G]iven that the axioms in special geometries are all special cases of general axioms, one can conclude from lack of contradiction in a special geometry to lack of contradiction in the general case, but not to lack of contradiction in another special case. (Letter of January 6, 1900 in Frege 1980: 48) Once he has pointed out what he takes to be the questionable inference, Frege takes it that the burden of argument is squarely with Hilbert: if Hilbert thinks that the consistency of \(\textit{AX}_{G}\) follows from either the consistency of \(\textit{AX}_{R}\) or from the satisfiability of \(R_{\textit{AX}}\), then it is up to Hilbert to show this. Frege does not go out of his way to demonstrate that the crucial inference is invalid, but seems to take his point to have been essentially made once he has pointed out the need for a justification here. From Hilbert’s point of view, of course, there is no need for such a justification. The differences that Frege insists on over and over again between the sets of sentences (AX) and the different sets of thoughts (\(\textit{AX}_{G}\), \(\textit{AX}_{R}\) etc.) are entirely inconsequential from Hilbert’s standpoint. Because consistency as Hilbert understands it applies to the “scaffolding” of concepts and relations defined by AX when its geometric terms are taken as place-holders, the consistency he has in mind holds (to put it in terms of thoughts) of \(\textit{AX}_{G}\) iff it holds of \(\textit{AX}_{R}\), since both sets of thoughts are instantiations of the same “scaffolding”. The same point can be put in terms of sentences: Frege insists that the consistency-question that arises for the sentences under their geometric interpretation is a different issue from the one that arises for those sentences under their real-number interpretation; for Hilbert on the other hand, there is just one question, and it is answered in the affirmative if there is any interpretation under which the sentences express truths. Hence while Frege takes it that Hilbert owes an explanation of the inference from the consistency of \(\textit{AX}_{R}\) to that of \(\textit{AX}_{G}\), for Hilbert there is simply no inference. Frege’s lack of clarity about his reasons for rejecting Hilbert’s procedure leaves an interpretive gap, with respect to which there is room for controversy. We should recall, to begin with, that Hilbert is clearly right that his own reinterpretation strategy suffices for the relative consistency and independence results he claims. If consistency and independence are understood, as above, in terms of non-provability, and if proof is, as Hilbert assumes, independent of the meanings of geometric terms, then \(\textit{AX}_{R}\), \(\textit{AX}_{G}\), and even AX itself are all consistent if one of them is. Frege’s rejection of Hilbert’s technique must involve, then, either some confusion about what Hilbert has established, or a different understanding of what is at issue in claims of consistency and independence. One way to understand Frege’s contribution to the Frege-Hilbert debate, then, is to recognize the contributions Frege makes in clarifying Hilbert’s own approach to axioms, but to hold that Frege’s negative assessment of Hilbert’s technique for proving consistency and independence is mistaken. On this account, despite the difference between Frege and Hilbert over the nature of axioms, nevertheless the satisfiability of \(R_{\textit{AX}}\) does show the consistency of the collection of axioms in question, whether one conceives of those axioms in Hilbert’s way as sentences (i.e., as the collection AX) or in Frege’s way as thoughts (i.e., as the collection \(\textit{AX}_{G}\)). Similarly for independence. Frege’s mistake, on this view, is to have failed to notice that the kind of non-provability result (i.e., consistency or independence) that Hilbert takes his reinterpretations to demonstrate for geometric sentences entails a corresponding non-provability (consistency or independence) result for geometric thoughts (see Resnik 1974, Currie 1982, Dummett 1975). The alternative interpretation argues that Frege’s understanding of consistency and independence is sufficiently different from Hilbert’s that the entailment in question does not hold: that the satisfiability of \(R_{\textit{AX}}\), and the consequent consistency in Hilbert’s sense of AX, does not entail the consistency in Frege’s sense of \(\textit{AX}_{G}\). Similarly for independence. According to this interpretation, Frege is right to claim that Hilbert’s demonstrations fail to show consistency and independence in the sense in which he, Frege, understands these  terms.[9] The central idea of the alternative interpretation is that for Frege, the question whether a given thought is logically entailed by a collection of thoughts is sensitive not just to the formal structure of the sentences used to express those thoughts, but also to the contents of the simple (e.g., geometric) terms that appear in those sentences. If this is correct, then we see immediately that the consistency of \(\textit{AX}_{R}\) need not entail the consistency of \(\textit{AX}_{G}\), since the question whether \(\textit{AX}_{G}\) logically entails a contradiction may turn in part on the specifically geometric parts of the thoughts in question, i.e., on the usual geometric meanings of AX’s geometric terms. To choose an illustrative example, though not one that Frege himself gives, consider the pair of sentences This pair of sentences is demonstrably consistent in Hilbert’s sense. But on the interpretation of Frege suggested here, this consistency (in Hilbert’s sense) does not ensure that the thoughts expressed by these sentences under their ordinary interpretation form a consistent collection. If, for example, Frege understands the relation ’between’ as susceptible to conceptual analysis, in accordance with which the first thought can be seen to logically entail the negation of the second, then the pair of thoughts are inconsistent with one another in the straightforward sense of logically entailing a contradiction. The idea that Frege takes logical entailment to be sensitive to conceptual analysis in the way just suggested is taken, on this account, to be evident in the strategy Frege employs in his life-long attempt to demonstrate his logicist thesis, the thesis that the truths of arithmetic are provable from pure logic. In the course of that project, Frege regularly provides demonstrations that a given thought τ follows logically from a set T of thoughts, in a way that involves two steps. First, Frege subjects τ and/or the members of T to conceptual analysis, bringing out previously-unrecognized conceptual complexity in those thoughts. Secondly, he proves the thus-analyzed version of τ from the thus-analyzed members of T. For example, Frege takes himself to demonstrate that the thought expressed by follows logically from the thoughts expressed by and by The demonstration proceeds by providing a careful analysis of the notion of “multiple of” in terms of addition, giving us in place of (i) a more-complex (i′) which is then proven from (ii) and  (iii).[10]  Similarly, a significant part of Frege’s logicist project consists of the careful analysis of such arithmetical notions as zero and successor, analysis which brings out previously-unnoticed complexity, and facilitates the proof of arithmetical truths. (For a discussion of the logicist project, see entries on  Frege  and  logicism and neologicism.) As Frege puts it in the early pages of his Foundations of Arithmetic, when we are trying to prove the truths of arithmetic from the simplest possible starting-points, … we very soon come to propositions which cannot be proved so long as we do not succeed in analysing concepts which occur in them into simpler concepts or in reducing them to something of greater generality. (Frege 1884: §4) In short: the components of thoughts can sometimes be analyzed in terms of simpler or more general constituents, in a way that brings to light previously-hidden relations of logical entailment. Hence when we want to know whether a given thought is logically entailed by a set of thoughts, we need to pay attention, from Frege’s point of view, not just to the overall structure exhibited by the sentences expressing those thoughts, but also to the contents of the individual terms that appear in those sentences. The connection between this aspect of Frege’s work and his views regarding independence, on the interpretation in question, is as follows. Because we can sometimes discover that a thought τ is logically entailed by a set T of thoughts only after a careful analysis of some of the apparently-simple components of those thoughts, so too we will sometimes be able to discover that a set of thoughts is inconsistent, i.e., that it logically entails a contradiction, on the basis of such conceptual analysis. Hence the consistency of the set of thoughts expressed by a set Σ of sentences is something which turns not just on the overall structure of the sentences in Σ, but on the meanings of the terms appearing in Σ’s sentences. To clarify this last point, let’s look at a non-mathematical example, one which neither Hilbert nor Frege explicitly dealt with. Consider the set of sentences {Jones had a nightmare, Jones didn’t have a dream}, or equivalently its first-order rendition, \(\{Nj, {{\sim}Dj}\}\). The set is clearly consistent in the sense used by Hilbert in FG; it is a straightforward matter to provide interpretations of “Jones”, “x had a nightmare” and “x had a dream” (or of “j”, “N”, and “D”) such that the sentences, so interpreted, express truths. (Consider, for example, an interpretation on which “j” is assigned the number 7, “N” the set of prime numbers, and “D” the set of numbers greater than 12.) But from the Fregean point of view, the thoughts expressed are arguably inconsistent, since part of what it is to have a nightmare is to have a dream. The inconsistency from Frege’s point of view can be demonstrated by providing an analysis of the thoughts expressed, and noting that the results of this analysis yield the set {Jones had a disturbing dream, Jones didn’t have a dream}. For the same reason, two sets of thoughts that are structurally similar in the sense that they can be expressed, under different interpretations, by the same set of sentences, can differ with respect to Frege-consistency. As applied to the geometric context, the central idea, on this account of Frege’s objection to Hilbert, is that the kinds of re-interpretation in which Hilbert engages can take one from a consistent set of thoughts (e.g., \(\textit{AX}_{R}\)) to an inconsistent one (e.g., \(\textit{AX}_{G}\)) because of the shift in subject-matter, hence invalidating the inference from the consistency of the first to the consistency of the second. Frege does not claim to be able to give specific geometric analyses which contradict particular consistency-claims of Hilbert’s, and there is no evidence that he takes any of those claims to be false. That he might well have had some such analyses in mind is hinted at in a letter to Hilbert in which he claims that in his own unfinished investigations into the foundations of geometry, he was able to “make do with fewer primitive terms”, which presumably means that he takes some of the terms treated as primitive by Hilbert to be susceptible of analysis via others (see the letter to Hilbert of December 27, 1899 in Frege 1980: 34). Any such analysis would reveal relations of logical dependence (from Frege’s point of view) where Hilbert would find independence. Because none of Frege’s work on this topic has survived, we have no details about the specific analyses he might have given. The crucial point in Frege’s criticism of Hilbert, however, on this account, is not a disagreement about particular analyses or the consequent failure of particular consistency and independence claims, but is instead about the general methodology of consistency and independence proofs. Because for Hilbert the consistency of a set of sentences turns entirely on the overall structure they exhibit, while for Frege the consistency of the set of thoughts expressed turns additionally on the contents of the non-logical terms appearing in the sentences, on this account, Hilbert-consistency doesn’t imply Frege-consistency.
