 As mentioned previously, there are no individual or predicate constants in the formal system of PM, only variables. The Introduction, however, makes use of the example “\(a\) standing in the relation \(R\) to \(b\)” in a discussion of atomic facts (PM, 43). Although “\(R\)” is later used as a variable that ranges over relations in extension, and “\(a,b,c,\ldots\)” are individual variables, let us temporarily add them to the system as predicate and individual constants, respectively, in order to discuss the use of variables in PM. PM makes special use of the distinction between “real”, or free, variables and “apparent”, or bound, variables. Since “\(x\)” is a variable, “\(xRy\)” will be an atomic formula in our extended language, with “\(x\)” and “\(y\)” real variables. When such formulae are combined with the propositional connectives \(\osim\), \(\lor\), etc., the result is a matrix. For example, “\(aRx \ldot {\lor} \ldot xRy\)” would be a matrix. As we saw earlier, there are also variables which range over functions: “\(\phi\), \(\psi\), \(\ldots,f, g\)”, etc. The expression “\(\phi x\)” thus contains two variables and stands for a proposition, in particular, the result of applying the function \(\phi\) to the individual \(x\). Theorems are stated with real variables, which gives them a special significance with regard to the theory. For example, is a fundamental axiom of the quantificational theory of PM. In this Primitive Proposition the variables “\(\phi\)” and “\(y\)” are real (free), and the “\(x\)” is apparent (bound). As there are no constants in the system, this is the closest that PM comes to a rule of universal instantiation. Whitehead and Russell interpret “\((x) \sdot \phi x\)” as “the proposition which asserts all the values for \(\phi \hat{x}\)” (PM 41). The use of the word “all” has special significance within the theory of types. They present the “vicious circle principle”, which underlies the theory of types, as asserting that Specifically, then, a quantified expression, since it talks about “all” the members of a totality, must range over a specific logical type in order to observe the vicious circle principle. Thus, when interpreting a bound variable, we must assume that it ranges over a specific type of entity, and so types must be assigned to the other entities represented by expressions in the formula, in observance with the theory of types. A question arises, however, once one realizes that the statements of primitive propositions and theorems in PM such as ∗10·1 are taken to be “typically ambiguous” (i.e., ambiguous with respect to type). These statements are actually schematic and represent all the possible specific assertions which can be derived from them by interpreting types appropriately. But if statements like ∗10·1 are schemata and yet have bound variables, how do we assign types to the entities over which the bound variables range? The answer is to first decide which type of thing the free variables in the statement range over. For example, assuming that the variable \(y\) in ∗10·1 ranges over individuals (of type \(\iota)\), then the variable \(\phi\) must range over functions of type \((\iota)/n\), for some \(n\). Then the bound variable \(x\) will also range over individuals. If, however, we assume that the variable \(y\) in ∗10·1 ranges over functions of type \((\iota)/1\), then the variable \(\phi\) must range over functions of type \(((\iota)/1)/m\), for some \(m\). In this case, the bound variable \(x\) will range over functions of type \((\iota)/1\). So \(y\) and \(\phi\) are called “real” variables in ∗10·1 not only because they are free but also because they can range over any type. Whitehead and Russell frequently say that real variables are taken to ambiguously denote “any” of their instances, while bound variables (which also ambiguously denote) range over “all” of their instances (within a legitimate totality, i.e. type).
