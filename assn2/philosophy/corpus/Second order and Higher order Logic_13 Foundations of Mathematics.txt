 Mathematics can be based on set theory. This means that mathematical objects are construed as sets and their properties are derived from the axioms of set theory. The intuitive informal picture behind set theory is that there is a cumulative hierarchy \(V_\alpha\) (\(\alpha\) an ordinal) of sets and the axioms are intended to describe the basic properties of such sets. This kind of set theoretical foundation of mathematics has become widely accepted among working mathematicians. We refer to the SEP entry on  set theory  for more details. Alternatives to set theory are at least  category theory,  constructive mathematics, and second-order logic. If one tries to follow as a logician the language mathematicians use in their research, one cannot help seeing that they use second-order concepts very freely. For example, the Induction Axiom is without doubt used by mathematicians in the second-order form depicted in (\ref{ind}). In their natural language mathematicians do not hesitate to use higher order concepts, and indeed do not always even (need to) know the difference. Second-order logic as a foundation for mathematics focuses on mathematical structures rather than mathematical “objects”, as set theory does. In principle every structure has its own “foundation” based on the special features of the structure. The role of second-order logic is to provide a common framework for this. The intuitive informal picture behind second-order logic on a structure is that there is a domain A of individuals and then separate domains for all n-ary relations for all \(n\in\oN\) and for all n-ary functions for all \(n\in\oN\), associated with A. In comparison to the informal picture of set theory, we have only the domains of subsets, relations and functions, not iterations such as sets of sets, sets of sets of sets and so on, as in set theory. Therefore the intuitive picture behind second-order logic is simpler than the picture behind set theory. In particular, there is no transfinite iteration over all ordinals. Most structures \(\ma\) used in mathematics have a second-order characterization \(\theta_\ma\), see  §10.  Proving (second order) properties \(\phi\) of such structures means deriving \(\phi\) from \(\theta_\ma\). Opinions differ as to whether this derivation should be a syntactic (formal) derivation using some (incomplete) axiom system of second-order logic or whether it should be a semantic derivation (of the form “Every model of the assumptions is a model of the conclusion”). For a working mathematician there is not much difference and probably a semantic derivation is usually favored. Suppose a mathematician wants to convince someone about the truth of Bolzano’s Theorem “If a continuous function on the reals has negative values as well as positive values inside an interval, then it has a root in that interval”. They would start with the ordered field of real numbers. It would be (thought to be) clear what this means because the second-order axiomatization of the field is categorical. Then they would take an arbitrary continuous function f on this field such that it has values of opposite sign inside a fixed interval \((a,b)\). It would be clear what this means because second-order logic has variables for functions. Let \(c,d\in (a,b)\) such that \(f(c)<0\) and \(f(d)>0\). Without loss of generality, \(c<d\). Let \(X=\{e\in(a,b) : f(e)<0\}\). Since we have relation variables for subsets of the domain, we can think of X simply as a value of such a relation variable. It is obvious that X exists, but a priori we could have imposed contradictory conditions on X (e.g., \(X=\{e : e\notin X\}\)) and then we should not be able to claim that it exists. However, in this case the Comprehension Axiom Schema implies that X exists. Clearly, \(X\ne\emptyset\) and X is bounded from above by d. One of the second-order axioms characterizing the field of real numbers is that every non-empty set which is bounded from above has a supremum. Thus we can let z to be the supremum of X. Now it follows from basic properties of continuous functions that \(f(z)=0\). It would be difficult to tell in the above proof whether it was a syntactical derivation from the axioms or a semantic argument. On the surface it looks like a semantic argument. But every step can be derived from the axioms, so it could be considered a shorthand version of a syntactic derivation. Syntactic derivations in second-order logic based on the Comprehension Axiom Schema and Axioms of Choice are very much like syntactic derivations in set theory. In neither case would a working mathematicians write all the details of the argument but would resort to shorthand notation. In both cases—second-order logic and set theory—we can interpret the proofs as shorthand versions of syntactic formal proofs or as semantic proofs. First order logic satisfies the Completeness Theorem with the help of which semantic proofs can be turned into syntactic formal proofs. Since the Completeness Theorem uses the concept of a first order structure, sentences proved from the axioms are true in all models of the axioms, both countable models and non-standard models. Are they true in the intuitive model of cumulative hierarchy of sets? By the Reflection Theorem such sentences are true in the class of all sets, but since the intuitive model is informal, we cannot prove that the class of all sets is the same as the intuitive model. On the other hand, in order for the Completeness Theorem to be applicable, a semantic argument has to be such that it works whatever model of set theory we are using. This means that a semantic argument in set theory should not use properties of individual models of set theory unless they are universal first order properties of all models of ZFC. In practice this means that if a property such as \(CH\), \(\Diamond\), \(2^{\aleph_0}=\aleph_2\), and so on, is used, it is mentioned separately as an assumption. Non-first order properties of models cannot be used at all, or else the Completeness Theorem cannot be used. Still, sometimes non-first order properties are used. For example, we may have an argument that every countable model of ZFC satisfies \(\phi\). But then, by the Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem, every model of ZFC satisfies \(\phi\). Thus we have been able to eliminate the non-first order assumption of the countability of the model. Second-order logic satisfies the Completeness Theorem if Henkin models are used. Thus semantic arguments in second-order logic can be turned into syntactic formal proofs, but as with set theory the semantic argument has to be valid in all Henkin models, not only in all of the full Henkin models. Thus, as in set theory, the semantic argument cannot use properties of the Henkin models that are not shared by all Henkin models, In particular, fullness (see  §9.1)  cannot be assumed because in general models it is not a second-order property. What happens to categoricity when fullness is abandoned? We still have internal categoricity, so we can use categoricity in proofs as long as we make sure we work inside one model. One certain way to make sure of this is that we base everything on the axioms, the Comprehension Axiom Schema and the Axioms of Choice. When second-order logic is used as a foundation for mathematics, a situation may emerge in which third order logic is needed. For example, a topology is usually defined as a family of sets and is therefore a third order object. It would be well in the spirit of second-order logic to simply include third (or higher) order logic when needed. Naturally, the Comprehension Axiom Schema and the Axioms of Choice have to be then assumed for third order quantifiers. We have devoted a fair amount of space in this entry to the power of second-order logic to characterize structures (see  §7.1).  Putting it briefly, if a structure has mathematical interest, it is second-order characterizable. Structures constructed by means of the Axiom of Choice may escape being second-order characterizable. But what is the power of second-order logic to demonstrate the existence of structures? The axioms, including the Comprehension Axioms and the Axioms of Choice, can be satisfied in a one element domain. So we cannot prove from the axioms that there are any structures of any size \(>1\). This undermines Quine’s characterization of second-order logic as “set theory in sheep’s clothing” (1970, section heading in chapter 5), meant probably to suggest that the ontological commitments of second-order logic are on the same level as those of set theory. Perhaps the philosophy of second-order logic is that if a structure can be characterized, it exists, echoing Hilbert’s formalist philosophy. However, even in that sense we need to know that the characterizing sentence \(\theta_\ma\) is consistent. A trivial approach is to observe that \(\ma\) itself certainly satisfies \(\theta_\ma\), but this clearly begs the question. Still, this is how Hilbert argues for the consistency of his axioms for the real numbers (1900). If \(\ma=(\oN,+,\cdot)\), an Axiom of Infinity saying that that a proper subset of the domain has the same cardinality as the entire domain, is what is needed. In combination with the Comprehension Axiom Schema the existence of \(\ma\) follows. For \((\oR,+,\cdot,0,1)\) this is not enough, we need a stronger Axiom of Infinity, for example the existence of a dense order which satisfies the Completeness Axiom: Every bounded non-empty set has a supremum. It seems inevitable that when we move from a structure to a bigger structure we need to make a largeness assumption. Such assumptions are called Large Domain Assumptions in Väänänen (2012). In set theory this aspect is taken care of at the outset by assuming the Power Set Axiom and the Replacement Axioms which together make sure that there are large enough sets. In second-order logic we have to assume new and new Large Domain Assumptions, as we move along. This can be seen as a drawback, having to make new assumptions all the time. On the other hand it can be seen as an asset, not having to make too ambitious assumptions before they are really needed.
