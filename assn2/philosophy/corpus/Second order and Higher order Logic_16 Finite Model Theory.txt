 The rise of mathematical logic in the first half of the twentieth century was interwoven with different approaches to understanding the infinite structures of the natural and the real numbers. With the emergence of computer science in the second half of the twentieth century logic went through a process of rebirth. The concepts of a computation and of a database both emphasized the need to understand not so much the finite/infinite distinction as the new measures of degrees of finiteness. For example, the question whether a problem can be decided in polynomial time arose to challenge the well-developed theory of what can be decided in finite time. The analogy between finite relational structures and databases led to the emergence of finite model theory. For a good review we refer to Fagin (1993). In the context of finite models second-order logic does not suffer from the same philosophical problems as in the context of infinite models. It is just one language among many others. One of the early successes was the result of Fagin (1974) to the effect that classes of models definable in existential second-order logic, i.e., in the \(\Sigma^1_1\)-fragment, are exactly those that are NP, i.e., that can be recognized by a non-deterministic Turing machine running in time which is polynomial in the size of the encoding of the model as a binary sequence. The question whether NP is closed under complements is notoriously open. From the point of view of second-order logic this is surprising because on all models, finite or infinite, \(\Sigma^1_1\) is of course not closed under complements. For example, the class of infinite models (in the empty vocabulary) is \(\Sigma^1_1\) but not \(\Pi^1_1\). Also, the class of well-orders is \(\Pi^1_1\) but not \(\Sigma^1_1\). Therefore the following early result about second-order logic on finite models was remarkable. Here \(\mon\Sigma^1_1\) refers to \(\Sigma^1_1\) in monadic second-order logic, similarly \(\mon\Pi^1_1\). Theorem 17 (Fagin 1975) Connectivity of graphs is not definable in \(\mon\Sigma^1_1\). Hence \(\mon\Sigma^1_1\ne\mon\Pi^1_1\). This has subsequently been extended to graphs with certain other structure present, see Fagin, Stockmeyer, and Vardi (1995). The proofs use the Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé games (see  §3.1)  and their elaborations. Let \(\Sigma^1_{1,m}\) denote the class of \(\Sigma^1_1\)-formulas \(\exists X_1\ldots\exists X_k\phi\), where the bound second-order variables \(X_i\) are at most m-ary and \(\phi\) is first order. Similarly \(\Pi^1_{1,m}\) and \(\Delta^1_{1,m}\). Theorem 18 (Ajtai 1983) The property of a finite structure \((A,R)\), where R is \(n+1\)-ary, of \(|R|\) being even, is \(\Delta^1_{1,n+1}\) but not \(\Sigma^1_{1,n}\) or \(\Pi^1_{1,n}\). This highly non-trivial theorem is one of the corner stones of the study of second-order logic on finite structures. We do not know whether \(\Delta^1_1\) is different from \(\Sigma^1_1\) on finite structures, but the above theorem gives an arity-based hierarchy result inside \(\Delta^1_1\).
