 Though the present section is not required for understanding the proof of Frege’s Theorem, we include it so that the reader can get some sense of how second-order logic (with comprehension) gives rise to Russell’s paradox when one adds Frege’s theory of courses-of-values and extensions. Though we shall briefly discuss Frege’s notation for courses-of-values, we’ll subsequently switch to simpler notation for naming the extensions of concepts. For the purposes of this section, let us suppose that we have primitive function terms \(f\), \(g\), \(h\), … in our language and that functional applications such as \(f(x)\), \(g(y)\), etc., are allowed. The principle that undermined Frege’s system, Basic Law V, was one that attempted to systematize the notions ‘course-of-values of a function’ and ‘extension of a concept’. The course-of-values of a function \(f\) is something like a set of ordered pairs that records the value \(f(x)\) for every argument \( x\). For example, the course-of-values of the function father of x records, among other things, that Bill Clinton is the value of the function when Chelsea Clinton is the argument. The course-of-values for the function \(x^2\) records, among other things, that the number 4 is the value when the number 2 is the argument, that 9 is the value when 3 is the argument, etc. When a function \(f\) is a concept, Frege called the course-of-values for that concept its extension. The extension of a concept is something like the set of all objects that fall under the concept, for the extension records all of the objects that the concept maps to The True. For example, the extension of the concept \(x\) is a positive even integer less than 8 is something like the set consisting of the numbers 2, 4, and 6. Frege introduces primitive notation for courses-of-values in Gg I, §9. He switched to the lower case Greek letters \(\epsilon\) and \(\alpha\) when writing the names of courses-of-values and extensions, and placed smooth breathing marks over them to indicate they were variable-binding operators. So: \(\stackrel{,}{\epsilon} f(\epsilon)\) and \(\stackrel{,}{\alpha}\! g(\alpha)\) designate the course-of-values of the functions \(f\) and \(g\), respectively. In this notation, the symbols \(\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}\) and \(\stackrel{,}{\alpha}\) bind the object variables \(\epsilon\) and \(\alpha\) in the expressions \(f(\epsilon)\) and \(g(\alpha)\), respectively, and the resulting expression denotes a course-of-values. Here is a pair of examples of Frege’s notation for courses-of-values. This pair of examples comes from Gg I, §9. Frege uses the expression: \(\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}\! (\epsilon^{2}- \epsilon)\) to denote the course-of-values of the function represented by the open formula: \(x^{2} - x\) He also uses: \(\stackrel{,}{\alpha}\! (\alpha \cdot (\alpha - 1))\) to denote the course-of-values of the function represented by the open formula: \(x \cdot (x - 1)\) Frege then notes that if the functions \(x^{2} - x\) and \(x \cdot (x - 1)\) map the same arguments to the same values, then the extensions of those two functions are the same, and vice versa. That is, he notes that: \(\forall x[x^{2}-x = x \cdot (x - 1)]\) holds if and only if: \({\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}}(\epsilon^{2} - \epsilon) = {\stackrel{,}{\alpha}} (\alpha \cdot (\alpha - 1))\) This equivalence will become embodied in Basic Law V. Indeed, Frege’s formulation of Basic Law V in Gg I, §20 can now be represented in our language (temporarily extended with function terms and functional application) as follows: Basic Law V:  \(\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}\! f(\epsilon) \eqclose \stackrel{,}{\alpha}\! g(\alpha) \equivwide \forall x[f(x) \eqclose g(x)]\) This principle asserts: the course-of-values of the function \(f\) is identical to the course-of-values of the function \(g\) if and only if \(f\) and g map every object to the same value. [Actually, Frege uses an identity sign instead of the biconditional sign as the main connective of the principle. The reason he could do this is that, in his system, when two sentences are materially equivalent, they name the same truth value.] We shall soon see why this principle is inconsistent. Since concepts, for Frege, are functions that always map their arguments to a truth value, we may introduce some new notation to help us represent Frege’s method of forming names of the extensions of concepts. This new notation takes advantage of our \(\lambda\)-notation for naming concepts, and so allows us to introduce a new kind of function term where Frege introduced a variable-binding operator. Let us stipulate that where \(\Pi\) is any 1-place concept term (name or variable), the notation ‘\(\epsilon\Pi\)’ designates the extension of the concept \(\Pi\). So, for example, \(\epsilon F\) denotes the extension of the concept \(F\). Note that 1-place \(\lambda\)-expressions of the form \([\lambda x\,\phi]\) are 1-place concept terms, and so \(\epsilon[\lambda x\,\phi]\) is well-formed and designates the extension of the concept \([\lambda x\,\phi]\). Thus, whereas Frege used \(\stackrel{,}{\epsilon}\) as a variable-binding operator that binds an object variable in a formula to produce the name of an extension, we are using \(\epsilon\) as a term-forming function symbol that applies to 1-place concept terms to produce terms denoting, or ranging over, objects. Thus, when \(\epsilon\) is prefixed to a concept name, the resulting expression is a name of an object, and in particular, a name of the extension of the concept denoted by the concept name. When the \(\epsilon\) is prefixed to a concept variable, e.g., as in \(\epsilon F\), the resulting expression is a kind of complex variable that ranges over extensions: for each value of the variable \(F\), \(\epsilon F\) denotes the extension of \(F\). Here is an example of our notation involving a pair of complex concepts. Consider the concept that which when added to 4 equals 5, or using \(\lambda\)-notation, the following concept: \([\lambda x \, x+4 = 5]\) We use the following notation to denote the extension of this concept: \(\epsilon[\lambda x \, x+4 = 5]\) Now consider the concept that which when added to \(2^{2}\) equals 5 (i.e., \([\lambda x~x+2^{2} = 5])\). We use the following notation to denote the extension of this concept: \(\epsilon[\lambda x \, x+2^{2} = 5]\) Note that it seems natural to identify these two extensions given that all and only the objects that fall under the first concept fall under the second. Those readers already familiar with the \(\lambda\)-calculus should remember that \(\epsilon[\lambda x~\phi]\) denotes an object, that \([\lambda x~\phi]\) denotes a concept, and that Frege rigorously distinguished objects and concepts and supposed them to constitute mutually exclusive domains. If we remember that the extension of a concept is something like the set of objects that fall under the concept, then we could replace Frege’s talk of ‘extensions’ by talk of ‘sets’ and use the following ‘set notation’ to refer to the set of objects that when added to 4 yield 5 and the set of objects that when added to \(2^{2}\) yield 5, respectively: Frege took advantage of his second-order language to define what it is for an object to be a member of an extension or set. Although Frege used the notation \(x \cap y\) to designate the membership relation, we shall follow the more usual practice of using \(x\in y\). Thus, the following captures the main features of Frege’s definition of membership in Gg I, §34: \(x\in y \eqdef \exists G (y\eqclose \epsilon G \amp Gx)\) In other words, \(x\) is an element of \(y\) just in case \(x\) falls under a concept of which \(y\) is the extension. For example, given this definition, one can prove that John is a member of the extension of the concept being happy (formally: \(j \in \epsilon H)\) from the premise that John falls under the concept being happy (‘\(Hj\)’). Here is a simple proof: Some readers may wish to examine a somewhat more complex example, in which the above definition of membership is used to prove that 1 \(\in \epsilon[\lambda x \, x+2^2 = 5]\) given the premise that \( 1+2^{2} = 5\).  (A More Complex Example) Before we turn to Basic Law V, it is important to mention an important fact about our representation of Frege’s system, in which we’ve introduced the term-forming operator \(\epsilon\) into second-order logic with identity. The resulting system has the following principle, which asserts that every concept has an extension, as a theorem: Existence of Extensions:  \(\forall G\exists x(x = \epsilon G)\) To see that this is derivable given our work thus far, recall line 2 of the proof in the above example: the laws of identity allow us to assert that: \(\epsilon F = \epsilon F\) In second-order logic with identity, this is an instance of \(x = x\) (strictly speaking, one first derives \(\forall x(x = x)\) from the axiom \(x = x\) by GEN, and then instantiates the universally quantified variable \(x\) to \(\epsilon F\)). So, by existential generalization, it follows that: \(\exists x(x = \epsilon F)\) But now the Existence of Extensions principle follows by universal generalization on the concept variable \(F\). Thus, simply by adding a term-forming operator such as \(\epsilon\) to classical logic with identity, it is provable that every concept gets correlated with an extension. Basic Law V will not only imply, but also place a condition on, this correlation. We can now represent the special case of Frege’s Basic Law V that applies to concepts, using our \(\epsilon\) notation: Basic Law V (Special Case):  \(\epsilon F\eqclose \epsilon G \equivwide \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)\) In this special case, Basic Law V asserts: the extension of the concept \(F\) is identical to the extension of the concept \(G\) if and only if all and only the objects that fall under \(F\) fall under \(G\) (i.e., if and only if the concepts \(F\) and \(G\) are materially equivalent). In more modern guise, Frege’s Basic Law V asserts that the set of \(F\)s is identical to the set of \(G\)s if and only if \(F\) and \(G\) are materially equivalent: \(\{x\mid Fx\}\eqclose \{y\mid Gy\} \equivwide \forall z(Fz \equiv Gz)\) The example discussed above can now be seen as an instance of Basic Law V: This asserts that the extension of the concept that which added to 4 yields 5 is identical to the extension of the concept that which added to \(2^{2}\) yields 5 if and only if all and only the objects that when added to 4 yield 5 are objects that when added to \(2^{2}\) yield 5. There are two important corollaries to Law V that play a role in what follows: the Law of Extensions and the Principle of Extensionality. The Law of Extensions (cf. Gg I, §55, Theorem 1) asserts that an object is a member of the extension of a concept if and only if it falls under that concept: Law of Extensions:  \(\forall F \forall x(x \in\epsilon F \equiv Fx)\) (Derivation of the Law of Extensions) Basic Law V also correctly implies the Principle of Extensionality. This principle asserts that if two extensions have the same members, they are identical. Let us define ‘\(x\) is an extension’ as follows: \(\mathit{Extension}(x) \eqdef \exists F (x = \epsilon F)\) Then we may formally represent and derive the principle of extensionality as follows: Principle of Extensionality:  \(\mathit{Extension}(x) \amp \mathit{Extension}(y) \to [\forall z(z \in x\equiv z\in y) \to x\eqclose y]\) (Derivation of the Principle of Extensionality) The above facts about Basic Law V will be used in the next subsections to show why it may not be consistently added to second-order logic with comprehension. Frege was made aware of the inconsistency by Bertrand Russell, who sent him a letter formulating ‘Russell’s Paradox’ just as the second volume of Gg was going to press. Frege quickly added an Appendix to the second volume, describing two distinct ways of deriving a contradiction from Basic Law V. He also suggested a way of repairing Law V, but Quine (1995) later showed that such a repair was disastrous, since it would force the domain of objects to contain at most one object. In the next subsections, we describe the two ways of deriving a contradiction from Basic Law V that Frege described in the Appendix to Gg. The first establishes the contradiction directly, without any special definitions. The second deploys the membership relation and more closely follows Russell’s Paradox. As we shall see, the following combination is a volatile mix: (a) the Comprehension Principle for concepts, which ensures that there is a concept corresponding to every formula with free variable \(x\), (b) the Existence of Extensions principle, which ensures every concept is correlated with an extension, and (c) Basic Law V, which ensures that the correlation of concepts with extensions behaves in a certain way. In the Appendix to Gg II, Frege shows that a contradiction can be derived from Basic Law V once we formulate the concept being an x that is the extension of some concept which x doesn’t fall under. We may use the following \(\lambda\)-expression to represent this concept: \([\lambda x \, \exists F (x\eqclose \epsilon F \amp \neg Fx)]\) We know that there exists such a concept, since the open formula in the scope of \(\lambda x\) can be used in the Comprehension Principle for Concepts. Now by the Existence of Extensions principle, the following concept exists and is correlated with it: \(\epsilon[\lambda x \, \exists F(x\eqclose \epsilon F \amp \neg Fx)]\) It can now be proved that this extension falls under the concept \([\lambda x \, \exists F(x\eqclose \epsilon F \amp \neg Fx)]\) if and only if it does not. (First Derivation of the Contradiction.) In the Appendix to Gg II, Frege also explains how Basic Law V implies the existence of the paradoxical Russell set. We can represent his reasoning as follows. From the Law of Extensions (which was derived from Basic Law V above), one can establish a Naive Comprehension Axiom for Extensions in three simple steps. First we instantiate the Law of Extensions to the free variable \(F\), to yield: \(\forall x(x \in \epsilon F\equiv Fx)\) By existentially generalizing on \(\epsilon F\), it follows that: \(\exists y\forall x(x \in y \equiv Fx)\) Now at this point, we may universally generalize on the variable \(F\) to get the following second-order Naive Comprehension Axiom for extensions, which asserts that for every concept \(F\), there is an extension which has as members all and only the objects that fall under \(F\): Naive Comprehension Axiom for Extensions:  \(\forall F\exists y\forall x(x\in y \equiv Fx)\) The Naive Comprehension Axiom gives rise to Russell’s Paradox once we instantiate the quantified variable \(F\) to the concept \([\lambda z \, z\notinclose z]\), where \(z \notinclose z\) simply abbreviates \(\neg(z\in z)\), to yield: \(\exists y\forall x(x\inclose y \equiv [\lambda z \, z\notinclose z]x)\) By \(\lambda\)-Conversion, this is equivalent to: \(\exists y\forall x(x\inclose y \equiv x \notinclose x)\) (Note: Frege could have reached this last result in one step from \(\exists y\forall x(x\inclose y \equiv Fx)\) using his Rule of Substitution.) The contradiction now goes as follows. Let \(b\) be such an object asserted to exist by the claim we just derived. So we know: \(\forall x(x\inclose b \equiv x\notinclose x)\) But we can now instantiate the universally quantified variable to the object \(b\) to yield the following contradiction: \(b\inclose b \equiv b\notinclose b\) (See the entry  on Russell’s Paradox.) We’ve now reconstructed the inconsistency in Frege’s system by representing his logic and Basic Law V in a modern system of second-order logic. Philosophers have diagnosed the inconsistency in various ways, and it is safe to say that the matter is still somewhat controversial. In this subsection, we discuss only the basic elements of the problem. Most philosophers and logicians agree that the reason second-order logic can’t be extended by Basic Law V is that the resulting system requires the impossible situation in which the domain of concepts has to be strictly larger than the domain of extensions while at the same time the domain of extensions has to be as large as the domain of concepts. To analyze the inconsistency in more detail, consider an extensional model of concepts, in which the material equivalence of concepts \(F\) and \(G\) serves as both necessary and sufficient conditions for the identity of \(F\) and \(G\), i.e., in which \(F = G \equiv \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)\).  So, given this understanding, if it is not the case that \(F\) and \(G\) are materially equivalent, then \(F\) and \(G\) are distinct concepts; and if \(F\) and \(G\) are distinct concepts, then they are not materially equivalent. With this extensional view of concepts in mind, we can see how a paradox is engendered. Recall first that the Existence of Extensions principle correlates each concept \(F\) with an extension \(\epsilon F\). Each direction of Basic Law V requires that this correlation have certain properties. We shall see, for example, that the right-to-left direction of Basic Law V (i.e., Va) requires that no concept gets correlated with two distinct extensions. [Frege uses the label ‘Vb’ to designate the left-to-right direction of Basic Law V, and uses ‘Va’ for a variant of the right-to-left direction. See, for example, Gg I, §52. However, many commentators use ‘Va’ to designate the left-to-right direction. We shall follow Frege’s use, since that will make sense of his Appendix to Gg II, in which he discusses the paradoxes by discussing Vb and Va.] We may represent Frege’s Va as follows: Basic Law Va:  \(\forall x(Fx \equiv Gx) \to\epsilon F = \epsilon G\) So the contrapositive asserts that if \(\epsilon F \neq \epsilon G\), then \(\neg \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)\).  But in the case where the material equivalence of \(F\) and \(G\) is a necessary condition for \(F = G\), i.e., in the case where \(\neg \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)\) implies \(F \neq G\), then Va implies that if \(\epsilon F \neq \epsilon G\), then \(F \neq G\), i.e., that whenever the extensions of \(F\) and \(G\) differ, the concepts with which they are correlated, namely \(F\) and \(G\), differ. This means that the correlation between concepts and extensions that Basic Law V sets up must be a function – no concept gets correlated with two distinct extensions (though for all Va tells us, distinct concepts might get correlated with the same extension). Frege noted (in the Appendix to Gg II) that this direction of Basic Law V doesn’t seem problematic. However, the left-to-right direction of Basic Law V (i.e., Vb) is more serious. We may represent Vb as follows: Basic Law Vb:  \(\epsilon F = \epsilon G \to\forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)\) So the contrapositive asserts that if \(\neg \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)\) then \(\epsilon F \neq \epsilon G\).  But in the case where the material equivalence of \(F\) and \(G\) is a sufficient condition for \(F = G\), i.e., in the case where \(F \neq G\) implies \(\neg \forall x(Fx \equiv Gx)\), then Vb implies \(F \neq G \to \epsilon F \neq \epsilon G\), i.e., that if concepts \(F\) and \(G\) differ, the extensions of \(F\) and \(G\) differ. So, the correlation that Basic Law V sets up between concepts and extensions will have to be one-to-one; i.e., it correlates distinct concepts with distinct extensions. Since every concept is correlated with some extension, there have to be at least as many extensions as there are concepts. But the problem is that second-order logic with Basic Law V as a whole requires that there be more concepts than extensions. The requirement that there be more concepts than extensions is imposed jointly by the Comprehension Principle for Concepts and the new significance this principle takes on in the presence of Basic Law V. The Comprehension Principle for Concepts asserts the existence of a concept for every condition on objects expressible in the language. Now although it may seem that this principle, in and of itself, forces the domain of concepts to be larger than the domain of objects, it is a model-theoretic fact that there are models of second-order logic with the Comprehension Principle for Concepts (but without Basic Law V) in which the domain of concepts is not larger than the domain of  objects.[2]  However, the addition of Basic Law V to Frege’s system forces the domain of concepts to be larger than the domain of objects (and so larger than the domain of extensions), due to the endless cycle of new concepts that arise in connection with the new extensions contributed by Basic Law V. However, as we saw in the last paragraph, Vb requires that there be at least as many extensions as there are concepts. Thus, the addition of Basic Law V to second-order logic implies an impossible situation in which the domain of concepts has to be strictly larger than the domain of extensions while at the same time the domain of extensions has to be as large as the domain of concepts. Recently, there has been a lot of interest in discovering ways of repairing the Fregean theory of extensions. The traditional view is that one must either restrict Basic Law V or restrict the Comprehension Principle for Concepts. Recently, Boolos (1986, 1993) developed one of the more interesting suggestions for revising Basic Law V without abandoning second-order logic and its comprehension principle for concepts. On the other hand, there have been many suggestions for restricting the Comprehension Principle for Concepts. The most severe of these is to abandon second-order logic (and the Comprehension Principle for Concepts) altogether. Schroeder-Heister (1987) conjectured that the first-order portion of Frege’s system (i.e., the system which results by adding Basic Law V to the first-order predicate calculus) was consistent and this was proved by T. Parsons (1987) and Burgess  (1998).[3]  Heck (1996), Wehmeier (1999), Ferreira & Wehmeier (2002), and Ferreira (2005) consider less drastic moves. They investigate systems of second-order logic which have been extended by Basic Law V but in which the Comprehension Principle for Concepts is restricted in some way. See also Anderson & Zalta (2004) and Antonelli & May (2005) for different approaches to repairing Frege’s system. See Fine (2002) for a discussion of the limits of Frege’s method and see Burgess (2005) for a good general overview. We will not discuss the above research further in the present entry, for none of these alternatives have achieved a clear consensus. Instead, we focus on the theoretical accomplishment revealed by Frege’s work in Gg. As noted in the Introduction, Frege validly proved a rather deep fact about the natural numbers notwithstanding the inconsistency of Basic Law V. He derived the Dedekind/Peano axioms for number theory in second-order logic from Hume’s Principle (which was briefly mentioned above and which will be discussed in the next section). But this fact went unnoticed for many years. Though Geach (1955) claimed such a derivation was possible, C. Parsons (1965) was the first to note that Hume’s Principle was powerful enough for the derivation of the Dedekind/Peano axioms. Though Wright (1983) actually carried out most of the derivation, Heck (1993) showed that although Frege did use Basic Law V to derive Hume’s principle, his (Frege’s) subsequent derivations of the Dedekind/Peano axioms of number theory from Hume’s Principle never made an essential appeal to Basic Law V. Since Hume’s Principle can be consistently added to second-order logic, we may conclude that Frege himself validly derived the basic laws of number theory. It will be the task of the next few sections to explain Frege’s accomplishments in this regard. We will do this in two stages. In §3 we study Frege’s attempt to derive Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V by analyzing cardinal numbers as extensions. Then, we put this aside in §4 and §5 to examine how Frege was able to derive the Dedekind/Peano axioms of number theory from Hume’s Principle alone.
