 Whitehead and Russell define a series in volume II of Principia Mathematica at *204.01 as the class Ser of all relations which is transitive, connected and irreflexive. A relation \(R\) is transitive when, if \(xRy\) and \(yRz\) then \(xRz\). It is connected when for any \(x\) and \(y\) for which it is defined, either \(xRy\) or \(yRx\). Finally, an irreflexive relation is one such that for all \(x\), it is not the case that \(xRx\). Any relation that has those properties forms a series of the things that it relates. Such relations are now called “linear orderings” or simply, “orderings”. Here the “logical construction” simply consists of an implicit definition of a certain property of relations. There is certainly no thought that series are merely invented “fictions”, and the symbol ‘Ser’ for them is “incomplete” only in that it can be explicitly defined as the intersection of other classes (a class of classes) and classes are themselves “incomplete”. Russell’s definitions of ordinal numbers and real numbers resemble the definitions of natural numbers. Ordinal numbers are a special case of  relation numbers. Just as a cardinal number can be defined as a class of similar classes where the similarity is simply equinumerosity, the existence of a one to one mapping between the two classes, a relation number is a class of similar classes which are ordered by some relation. Ordinal numbers are the relation numbers of well-ordered classes. “Relation-Arithmetic” is the subject of Part IV of Volume II of Principia Mathematica, chapters *150 to *186. All of the properties of the arithmetic of ordinal numbers are derived from the more general arithmetic of relation numbers. Thus, for example, the addition of ordinal numbers is not commutative. The first infinite ordinal \(\omega\) is the relation number of the well-ordered classes similar to \(1, 2, 3, \ldots\) etc. The sum \(1 + \omega\) will be the relation number of ordered classes which result from adding one element at the beginning of the ordering, say \(0, 1, 2, 3, \ldots\) etc., which has the same ordinal number \(\omega\). Thus \(1 + \omega = \omega\). On the other hand, adding an element at the “end” of such a well ordered class will give an ordering that is not similar: \(1, 2, 3, \ldots \text{etc.}, 0\). Consequently, \(1 + \omega \ne \omega + 1\). On the other hand addition of ordinals, and indeed relation numbers in general, is associative, that is, \((\alpha + \beta) + \gamma = \alpha + (\beta + \gamma)\), which is proved with certain restrictions in *174. Ordinal numbers are thus defined exactly as natural numbers, as classes of similar classes, in such a way that all the desired theorems can be proved. Describing ordinal numbers as “fictions”, “incomplete symbols” and “constructions” applies in the same way as in the case of natural numbers. The class of real numbers, Θ, is defined in Volume III of Principia Mathematica at *310.01 as consisting of “Dedekindian series” of rational numbers, which are in turn relation numbers of “ratios” of natural numbers. Whitehead and Russell follow the account of real numbers as Dedekind cuts of the rational numbers, and only differ from more standard developments of the numbers in contemporary set theory by treating rational numbers as relation numbers of a certain sort, rather than ordered pairs of and integers (the “numerator” and “denominator”). Like the construction of relation numbers as classes of similar classes, the “logical construction” of real numbers differs from the theory of definite descriptions and classes in general in not defining “incomplete symbols” or by showing that these numbers are really “fictions”. They are best characterized as definitions that allow for the proof of theorems about these numbers that would otherwise have to be postulated as axioms. They are the product of the “honest toil” that Russell prefers.
