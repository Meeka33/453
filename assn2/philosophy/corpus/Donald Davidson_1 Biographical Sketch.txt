 Donald Herbert Davidson was born on March 6th, 1917, in Springfield, Massachusetts, USA. He died suddenly, as a consequence of cardiac arrest following knee surgery, on Aug. 30, 2003, in Berkeley, California. Remaining both physically and philosophically active up until his death, Davidson left behind a number of important and unfinished projects including a major book on the nature of predication. The latter volume was published posthumously (see Davidson 2005b), together with two additional volumes of collected essays (Davidson 2004, 2005a), under the guidance of Marcia Cavell. Davidson completed his undergraduate study at Harvard, graduating in 1939. His early interests were in literature and classics and, as an undergraduate, Davidson was strongly influenced by A. N. Whitehead. After starting graduate work in classical philosophy (completing a Master’s degree in 1941), Davidson’s studies were interrupted by service with the US Navy in the Mediterranean from 1942–45. He continued work in classical philosophy after the war, graduating from Harvard in 1949 with a dissertation on Plato’s ‘Philebus’ (1990b). By this time, however, the direction of Davidson’s thinking had already, under Quine’s influence, changed quite dramatically (the two having first met at Harvard in 1939–40) and he had begun to move away from the largely literary and historical concerns that had preoccupied him as an undergraduate towards a more strongly analytical approach. While his first position was at Queen’s College in New York, Davidson spent much of the early part of his career (1951–1967) at Stanford University. He subsequently held positions at Princeton (1967–1970), Rockefeller (1970–1976), and the University of Chicago (1976–1981). From 1981 until his death he worked at the University of California, Berkeley. Davidson was the recipient of a number of awards and fellowships and was a visitor at many universities around the world. Davidson was married three times, with his third marriage, in 1984, being to Marcia Cavell, who undertook the editing of Davidson’s posthumously published essays.
