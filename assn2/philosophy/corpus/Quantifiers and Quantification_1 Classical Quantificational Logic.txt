 What is now a commonplace treatment of quantification began with Frege (1879), where the German philosopher and mathematician, Gottlob Frege, devised a formal language equipped with quantifier symbols, which bound different styles of variables. He formulated axioms and rules of inference, which allowed him to represent a remarkable range of mathematical argumentation. Classical quantificational logic is sometimes known as “first-order” or “predicate” logic, which is generally taken to include functional and constant symbols. The vocabulary of classical quantificational logic is often supplemented with an identity predicate to yield the classical theory of quantification with identity. At the core of classical quantificational logic lies what we may call pure quantificational logic, which makes no provision for any singular terms other than variables. In pure quantificational logic, one may still make use of Russell’s theory of definite description to simulate singular terms for which we have a method of contextual elimination. The vocabulary of pure quantificational logic contains the usual propositional connectives: \(\lnot\), \(\wedge\), \(\vee\), \(\rightarrow\), and \(\leftrightarrow\). It contains predicate letters of various sorts: one-place predicate letters with or without subscripts, \(P^{1}, Q^{1}, R^{1}, P^{1}_{1}\), …, two-place predicate letters, \(P^{2}, Q^{2}, R^{2}, P^{2}_{1}\), …, and more generally, \(n\)-place predicate letters. Sentence letters are 0-place predicates. There is, in addition to this, an infinite stock of variables with or without subscripts: \(x, y, z, x_1, y_1, z_1\), … , and two quantifiers \(\forall\) and \(\exists\). In a classical framework, we need not treat all these symbols as primitive; we may, for example, treat \(\lnot\), \(\rightarrow\), and \(\forall\) as primitive and provide standard definitions for the other propositional connectives and quantifiers in terms of them. For example, the existential quantifier, \(\exists x \ A\), may be defined: \(\lnot \forall x \ \lnot A\). The definition of a formula of the language of pure quantificational logic proceeds recursively as follows. First, one defines an atomic formula to consist of an \(n\)-place predicate followed by \(n\) variables: \(P^{n}_{i} x_{1}\), …, \(x_{n}\). One then defines \(A\) to be a formula of the language of pure quantificational logic if, and only if, (i) \(A\) is an atomic formula, or (ii) \(A\) is of the form \(\lnot B\), where \(B\) is a formula, or (iii) \(A\) is of the form \((B \rightarrow C)\), where \(B\) and \(C\) are each a formula, or (iv) \(A\) is of the form \(\forall x \ B\), where \(x_i\) is a variable and \(B\) is a  formula.[2] All occurrences of variables in an atomic formula are free. The free occurrences of variables in the negation of a formula \(\lnot B\) are the free occurrences of variables in \(B\). The free occurrences of variables in a formula of the form \((B \rightarrow C)\) are the free occurrences of variables in \(B\) and \(C\). Finally, the free occurrences of variables in a quantified formula \(\forall x \ B\) are the variables other than \(x\) that are free in \(B\). We call \(B\) the scope of the initial occurrence of the quantifier \(\forall x\) in \(\forall x \ B\). If an occurrence of a variable is not free in a formula \(A\), then it is bound; all occurrences of \(x\) in \(B\) are bound in the quantified formula \(\forall x \ B\). In fact, we will often write that they lie within the scope of the initial quantifier. A formula \(A\) is closed if, and only if, all of its variables are bound. Otherwise, \(A\) is open. A variable \(y\) is free for \(x\) if, and only if, no free occurrences of \(x\) lies within the scope of a quantification on \(y\), \(\forall y\). We write \(A(y/x)\) for the formula that results from \(A\) when every free occurrence of \(x\) in \(A\) is replaced by an occurrence of the variable \(y\). A sentence is a closed formula of the language. Frege’s Begriffsschrift develops a formal system, which includes axioms for quantification over individual objects and concepts. For Frege, objects are the appropriate values for singular variables, and a concept is what is referred to by a predicate. Notice that despite Frege’s use of the term, concepts, for him, are nothing like mental constructs, but rather objective constituents of the world. In particular, concepts are functions, which map objects into truth values. Since a predicate like “is extended” is true of some objects and false of others, Frege takes the concept being extended to assign truth to an object if, and only if, it is extended. Frege’s system is an axiomatization of what has come to be known as second-order logic, which is an important extension of classical quantificational logic. Hilbert & Ackermann (1928) contains the first axiomatic treatment of quantificational logic as a subject of its own, which they called “the narrower functional calculus”. In what follows, we look at what is now a common axiomatization of pure quantificational logic. This axiom system adopts all tautologies of propositional logic as axioms and modus ponens as a rule of inference, and it supplements them with two more axiom schemata and a rule of universal generalization. The first two axiom schemata are: The first axiom, (\(\forall 1\)), is commonly known as the axiom of universal instantiation. To complete the axiomatization, we need to add a rule of universal generalization: Since \(\exists x \ A\) abbreviates \(\lnot \forall x \lnot \ A\), we have a principle of existential generalization: This principle is not without consequence. Since, for example, \(Px \rightarrow Px\) is a tautology, which is available as an axiom, the combination with modus ponens and existential generalization yields \(\exists x (Px \rightarrow Px)\) as a theorem. For another controversial example, consider the theorem \(\forall x \ Px \rightarrow \exists x \ Px\), which is similarly derivable from the axioms by combining universal instantiation and existential generalization. Some have found these consequences objectionable on the grounds that the existence of an object should not be derivable from logic alone. The interpretation of the language of pure quantificational logic requires one to specify both a domain for the variables to range over and an extension for each non-logical predicate of the language. Alfred Tarski developed what is now known as a model theory for a wide range of formal languages. We recall some definitions from the entry on  model theory.  A model for the language of pure quantificational logic is an ordered pair, \(\langle D, I\rangle\), where \(D\) is a non-empty set, and \(I\) is an interpretation function, which maps each \(n\)-place predicate of the language into a set of ordered \(n\)-tuples of objects in the set \(D\). \(D\) provides the domain of discourse for the quantifier, and \(I\) provides each predicate of the language with an extension: one-place predicates are mapped into subsets of \(D\), two-place predicates are mapped into sets of ordered pairs of members of \(D\), and more generally, \(n\)-place predicates are mapped into sets of \(n\)-tuples of members of \(D\). Truth in a model is then defined in terms of satisfaction. A variable assignment \(s\) for the model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) is a function from the set of variables of the language into the domain \(D\). A formula \(A\) is satisfied in a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by an assignment \(s\) of objects to variables. If \(s\) is a variable assignment for \(\langle D, I\rangle\), we write \(s[x/d]\) to specify a variable assignment, which is just like \(s\) except perhaps for the fact that it assigns object \(d\) in \(D\) to the variable \(x\). We define a formula to be satisfied in a model \(\langle D, I \rangle\) by an assignment \(s\) recursively as follows. An atomic formula \(P^{n}_{i} x_{1}, \ldots , x_{n}\) is satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by \(s\) if, and only if, \(\langle s(x_{1}), \ldots, s(x_{n})\rangle \in I(P^{n}_{i})\), which means that the \(n\)-tuple of objects \(s\) assigns to the variables that occur in the formula is in the interpretation of the predicate \(P^{n}_{i}\) under \(I\). A negation \(\lnot B\) is satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by \(s\) if, and only if, \(B\) is not satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by \(s\). A conditional \((B \rightarrow C)\) is satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by \(s\) if, and only if, \(B\) is not satisfied or \(C\) is satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by \(s\). Finally, \(\forall x \ B\) is satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by \(s\) if, and only if, \(B\) is satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by all assignments of the form \(s[x/d]\), where \(d\) is a member of the domain \(D\). A formula \(A\) is true in a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) if, and only if, \(A\) is satisfied in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) under all assignments for the model. A formula \(A\) is valid if, and only if, \(A\) is true in all models. The Tarskian model theory for pure quantificational logic gives us exactly what we want. Since the axioms of pure quantificational logic are valid and the rules of inference preserve validity, all theorems of pure quantificational logic are valid.  (Soundness).[3]  One may in addition, prove that all valid formulas are, in fact, derivable from the axioms of pure quantificational logic. (Completeness). The entry on  classical logic  outlines a proof. Call a set of formulas \(\Gamma\) satisfiable if, and only if, there is a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) and a variable assignment \(s\), which satisfies each formula \(A\) in \(\Gamma\) in the model. A set \(\Gamma\) of formulas is satisfiable if, and only if, every finite subset of \(\Gamma\) is satisfiable. (Compactness). This is a simple corollary of Completeness. A simple version of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem states that if a set of formulas \(\Gamma\) has an infinite model, then it has a denumerable model, where a denumerable model is one whose domain is no larger than the set of natural numbers. There is a generalized form as well. If we let the cardinality \(\kappa\) of the non-logical vocabulary be greater than \(\aleph_0\), which is the cardinality of the set of natural numbers, then if \(\Gamma\) has an infinite model, then it has a model of cardinality \(\kappa\). Model-theoretic interpretations are sets: a model is an ordered pair of a non-empty set and an interpretation function. But since modern  set theory  proves that there is no universal set, no model can ever interpret the quantifiers by means of a universal domain of discourse. It may seem, then, that there are interpretations of the language of pure quantificational logic to which no model corresponds. And this raises the question of whether truth in all models may fall short of truth under all interpretations of the language. Fortunately, there is an elegant argument due to Georg Kreisel (1967), which tells us that we can safely restrict attention to set-based models for the specification of the set of validities of pure quantificational logic: a formula \(A\) of the language of quantificational logic is true under every interpretation of the language if, and only if, it is true in every model. The argument is a simple application of Completeness. If \(A\) is true under every interpretation, whether it is a model or not, then \(A\) will be true in every model. The challenge, however, is to argue for the converse. But if \(A\) is true in every model, then, by Completeness, \(A\) is a theorem of pure quantificational logic. And since every theorem is presumably true under every interpretation, not just model-theoretic ones, it follows that \(A\) is true under every interpretation. Thus Kreisel’s argument suggests we can make do with models for the purpose of characterizing validity in pure quantificational  logic.[4] Classical quantificational logic allows for singular terms other than variables. There are, first, individual constants, and, second, singular terms, which result from the combination of a function symbol with an appropriate number of singular terms. In addition to this, classical quantificational logic with identity makes provision for a special identity predicate. The vocabulary of the classical theory of quantification and identity extends the vocabulary of pure quantificational logic with a set of individual constants with or without subscripts, \(a, b, c, a_1\), …, and a set of function symbols of various kinds: one-place function symbols, \(f^{1}, g^{1}, f^{1}_{1}\), …, two-place function symbols, \(f^{2}, g^{2}, g^{2}_{1}\),  etc.[5]  In addition to this, we may add a special two-place predicate, \(=\), for identity. Before we modify the definition of formula for the expanded language, we may give a recursive definition of a term of the language of the classical theory of quantification and identity. An expression \(t\) is a term if, and only if, (i) \(t\) is an individual variable, or (ii) \(t\) is an individual constant, or (iii) \(t\) is an expression of the form \(f^{n}_{i}t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}\), where \(f^{n}_{i}\) an \(n\)-place function symbol and \(t_1\), …, \(t_n\) are themselves terms. Given the definition of term, we can reformulate the definition of atomic formula for the expanded language to consist of all and only expressions \(A\) of the form \(P^n_i t_1, \ldots, t_n\), where \(P^n_i\) is an \(n\)-place predicate and \(t_1\), …, \(t_n\) are each terms or \(t_i = t_j\) in which \(t_i\) and \(t_j\) are terms. At this point, we may adapt the usual recursive definition of formula for the expanded language. The axioms of classical quantificational logic with identity include axioms for quantification and axioms for identity. The axioms for quantification include a suitably modified variant of \((\forall 1)\) in addition to \((\forall 2)\) and \((\forall 3)\). The minimal adjustment in \((\forall 1)\) is meant to accommodate the presence of function symbols and individual constants. We call a term \(t\) free for a variable \(x\) if, and only if, no free occurrence of \(x\) lies within the scope of a quantifier \(\forall y\) or \(\exists y\), where \(y\) is a variable which occurs in \(t\). The axiom of universal instantiation, \((\forall 1)\), now reads: The other set of axioms concerns identity. In particular, we will supplement the axioms for quantification with an axiom, (I1), and an axiom schema, (I2), designed to govern the identity predicate: The first axiom is sometimes known as Reflexivity, and the second is known as the Indiscernibility of Identicals. When combined, they enable one to derive the symmetry and transitivity of identity as immediate  consequences.[6] We need only make minimal adjustments in the model theory in order to accommodate the expanded vocabulary of the classical theory of quantification and identity. A model \(\langle D, I \rangle\) will still consist of a non-empty domain, \(D\), and an interpretation function, \(I\). One difference, however, is that we now take \(I\), in addition, to assign a member of the domain \(D\) to each individual constant and to assign an \(n\)-place function from the set of ordered \(n\)-tuples of members of \(D\), \(D^{n}\), into \(D\) to each function symbol \(f^{n}_{i}\). We now define satisfaction in terms of denotation. Given a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) and an assignment \(s\) for the model, we say that a term \(t\) denotes a member \(d\) of the domain under assignment \(s\), in symbols \(Den_{s}(t) = d\), if, and only if, (i) \(t\) is a variable \(x_i\) and \(s(x_i) = d\), or (ii) \(t\) is an individual constant \(c\) and \(I(c) = d\), or (iii) \(t\) is of the form \(f^{n}_{i}t_1 , \ldots, t_n\) and \(d = I(f^{n}_{i})(Den_{s}(t_1), \ldots, Den_{s}(t_n))\). The definition of satisfaction in a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) by an assignment \(s\) proceeds much like before, except for the obvious clauses for atomic formulas of the form \(P^n_i t_1, \ldots, t_n\) and \(t_i = t_j\): \(P^n_i t_1, \ldots, t_n\) is satisfied by \(s\) in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) if and only if \(\langle Den_{s}(t_1), \ldots, Den_{s}(t_n) \rangle \in I(P^n_i)\). And \(t_i = t_j\) is satisfied by \(s\) in \(\langle D, I\rangle\) if and only if the denotation of \(t_i\) under \(s\) is identical to the denotation of \(t_j\) under \(s\). The definitions of truth in a model and validity carry over from pure quantificational logic. We have Soundness and Completeness theorems for classical quantificational logic with identity as well as Compactness and Löwenheim-Skolem theorems. The entry on  first-order model theory  offers an in-depth examination of these and other meta-theoretic results for classical quantificational logic with identity.
