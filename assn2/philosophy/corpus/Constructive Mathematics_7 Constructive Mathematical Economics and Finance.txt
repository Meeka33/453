 Investigations in constructive mathematical economics date back to a series of papers on preference, utility, and demand from 1982 onwards; see Bridges [1999]. In his doctoral thesis, Hendtlass [2013] substantially weakened the conditions for the existence of a demand function; he also produced a wealth of results in fixed-point theory and its applications, in particular to constructivisations of two classical proofs of the existence of an economic equilibrium. In 2015, Berger and Svindland began a research project on constructive mathematical finance, at Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität in Munich.They first showed that the fundamental theorem on asset pricing, the separating hyperplane theorem, and Markov’s Principle are constructively equivalent (Berger & Svindland [2016]). Their more recent work has concentrated on how to circumvent the nonconstructivity of the classical extreme value theorem in order to prove the existence of extreme points for functions in the presence of even relatively weak convexity properties (Berger & Svindland [2016a]). Their project suggests that mathematical finance, like mathematical economics, may be a rich source of elegant, practical constructive theorems.
