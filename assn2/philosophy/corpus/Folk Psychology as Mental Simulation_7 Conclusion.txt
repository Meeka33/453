 Since the late 1980s, ST has received a great amount of attention from philosophers, psychologists, and neuroscientists. This is not surprising. Mindreading is a central human cognitive capacity, and ST challeges some basic assumptions about the cognitive processes and neural mechanisms underlying human social behavior. Moreover, ST touches upon a number of major philosophical problems, such as the relation between self-knowledge and knowledge of other minds, and the nature of mental concepts, including the concept of mind itself. In this entry, we have considered some of the fundamental empirical and philosophical issues surrounding ST. Many of them remain open. In particular, while the consensus view is now that both mental simulation and theorizing play important role in mindreading, the currently available evidence falls short of establishing what their respective roles are. In other words, it is likely that we shall end up adopting a hybrid model of mindreading that combines ST and TT, but, at the present stage, it is very difficult to predict what this hybrid model will look like. Hopefully, the joint work of philosophers and cognitive scientists will help to settle the matter.
