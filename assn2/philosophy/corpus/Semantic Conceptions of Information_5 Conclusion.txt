 Philosophical theories of semantic information have recently contributed to a new area of research in itself, the philosophy of information (Adams [2003], Floridi [2011]).  The Routledge Handbook of Philosophy of Information (Floridi (ed.) 2016) provides an overview of the scope and depth of current work in the field. Information seems to have become a key concept to unlock several philosophical problems. “The most valuable commodity I know of is information”, boldly declares Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone’s Wall Street (1987). Euphranor would probably have concurred. The problem is that we still have to agree about what information is exactly.
