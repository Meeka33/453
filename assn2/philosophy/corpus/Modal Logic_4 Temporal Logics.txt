 In temporal logic (also known as tense logic), there are two basic operators, \(G\) for the future, and \(H\) for the past. \(G\) is read ‘it always will be that’ and the defined operator \(F\) (read ‘it will be the case that’) can be introduced by \(FA = {\sim}G{\sim}A\). Similarly \(H\) is read: ‘it always was that’ and \(P\) (for ‘it was the case that’) is defined by \(PA={\sim}H{\sim}A\). A basic system of temporal logic called \(\mathbf{Kt}\) results from adopting the principles of \(\bK\) for both \(G\) and \(H\), along with two axioms to govern the interaction between the past and future operators: Necessitation Rules:   If \(A\) is a theorem then so are \(GA\) and \(HA\). Distribution Axioms:  \(G(A\rightarrow B) \rightarrow(GA\rightarrow GB)\) and \(H(A\rightarrow B) \rightarrow (HA\rightarrow HB)\) Interaction Axioms: \(A\rightarrow GPA\) and \(A\rightarrow HFA\) The interaction axioms raise questions concerning asymmetries between the past and the future. A standard intuition is that the past is fixed, while the future is still open. The first interaction axiom \((A\rightarrow GPA)\) conforms to this intuition in reporting that what is the case \((A)\), will at all future times, be in the past \((GPA)\). However \(A\rightarrow HFA\) may appear to have unacceptably deterministic overtones, for it claims, apparently, that what is true now \((A)\) has always been such that it will occur in the future \((HFA)\). However, possible world semantics for temporal logic reveals that this worry results from a simple confusion, and that the two interaction axioms are equally acceptable. Note that the characteristic axiom of modal logic, \((M): \Box A\rightarrow A\), is not acceptable for either \(H\) or \(G\), since \(A\) does not follow from ‘it always was the case that \(A\)’, nor from ‘it always will be the case that \(A\)’. However, it is acceptable in a closely related temporal logic where \(G\) is read ‘it is and always will be’, and \(H\) is read ‘it is and always was’. Depending on which assumptions one makes about the structure of time, further axioms must be added to temporal logics. A list of axioms commonly adopted in temporal logics follows. An account of how they depend on the structure of time will be found in the section  Possible Worlds Semantics. It is interesting to note that certain combinations of past tense and future tense operators may be used to express complex tenses in English. For example, \(FPA\), corresponds to sentence \(A\) in the future perfect tense, (as in ‘20 seconds from now the light will have changed’). Similarly, \(PPA\) expresses the past perfect tense.
