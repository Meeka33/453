 Gödel’s constructible universe, denoted by \(L\), is defined by transfinite recursion on the ordinals, similarly as \(V\), but at successor steps, instead of taking the power set of \(V_\alpha\) to obtain \(V_{\alpha +1}\), one only takes those subsets of \(L_\alpha\) that are definable in \(L_\alpha\), using elements of \(L_\alpha\) as parameters. Thus, letting \(\mathcal{P}^{Def}(X)\) to denote the set of all the subsets of \(X\) that are definable in the structure \((X,\in )\) by a formula of the language of set theory, using elements of \(X\) as parameters of the definition, we let \(L_0={\varnothing}\) \(L_{\alpha +1}=\mathcal{P}^{Def}(L_\alpha)\) \(L_\lambda =\bigcup_{\alpha <\lambda}L_\alpha\), whenever \(\lambda\) is a limit ordinal. Then \(L\) is the union of all the \(L_\alpha\), for \(\alpha\) an ordinal, i.e., \(L=\bigcup_{\alpha \in ON}L_\alpha\). Gödel showed that \(L\) satisfies all the ZFC axioms, and also the CH. In fact, it satisfies the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH), namely \(2^{\aleph_\alpha}=\aleph_{\alpha +1}\), for every ordinal \(\alpha\). The statement \(V=L\), called the axiom of constructibility, asserts that every set belongs to \(L\). It holds in \(L\), hence it is consistent with ZFC, and implies both the AC and the GCH. The proper class \(L\), together with the \(\in\) relation restricted to \(L\), is an inner model of ZFC, that is, a transitive (i.e., it contains all elements of its elements) class that contains all ordinals and satisfies all the ZFC axioms. It is in fact the smallest inner model of ZFC, as any other inner model contains it. More generally, given any set \(A\), one can build the smallest transitive model of ZF that contains \(A\) and all the ordinals in a similar manner as \(L\), but now starting with the transitive closure of \(\{A \}\), i.e., the smallest transitive set that contains \(A\), instead of \({\varnothing}\). The resulting model, \(L(A)\), need not be however a model of the AC. One very important such model is \(L(\mathbb{R})\), the smallest transitive model of ZF that contains all the ordinals and all the real numbers. The theory of constructible sets owes much to the work of Ronald Jensen. He developed the so-called fine structure theory of \(L\) and isolated some combinatorial principles, such as the diamond (\(\diamondsuit\)) and square (\(\Box\)), which can be used to carry out complicated constructions of uncountable mathematical objects. Fine structure theory plays also an important role in the analysis of bigger \(L\)-like models, such as \(L(\mathbb{R})\) or the inner models for large cardinals (see  Section 10.1).
