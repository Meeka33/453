 The definitions up to ∗120·03 constitute only about half of the definitions in PM. The last eight pages (667–674) of Volume I of the second edition (1925) consists of a complete “List of Definitions” from all three volumes. Correspondence in the Bertrand Russell Archives suggests that this list may have been compiled by Dorothy Wrinch. The list can be used to trace every one of the defined expressions of PM back to the notation discussed in this entry.
