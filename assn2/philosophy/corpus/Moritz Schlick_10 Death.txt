 As Schlick was leaving class on June 22, 1936, he was shot four times in the legs and abdomen by Johann Nelböck, a former philosophy student who had been threatening Schlick for several years. In fact, Nelböck had been confined in an asylum for observation and diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. Eventually, other factors –both social and political- emerged which may also have influenced Nelböck. The number of possible motivations make it nearly impossible to fully understand what was in Nelböck’s mind at the time of his murderous actions.  But the result of his misdeed is clear: with the death of Moritz Schlick, philosophy lost one of its most creative thinkers. See Stadler 2001 (Part 2, Sec. 3–3.2) for a comprehensive account of Schlick’s death.
