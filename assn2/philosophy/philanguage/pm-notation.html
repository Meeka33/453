<p>
<em>Principia Mathematica</em> [PM] by A.N. Whitehead and Bertrand
Russell, published 1910&ndash;1913 in three volumes by Cambridge
University Press, contains a derivation of large portions of
mathematics using notions and principles of symbolic logic. The
notation in that work has been superseded by the subsequent
development of logic during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, to the extent
that the beginner has trouble reading PM at all. This article provides
an introduction to the symbolism of PM, showing how that symbolism can
be translated into a more contemporary notation which should be
familiar to anyone who has had a first course in symbolic logic. This
translation is offered as an aid to learning the original notation,
which itself is a subject of scholarly dispute, and embodies
substantive logical doctrines so that it cannot simply be replaced by
contemporary symbolism. Learning the notation, then, is a first step
to learning the distinctive logical doctrines of <em>Principia
Mathematica</em>. </p>

<h2 id="WhyLearSymbPrinMath">1. Why Learn the Symbolism in <em>Principia Mathematica?</em></h2>

<p>
<em>Principia Mathematica</em> [PM] was written jointly by Alfred
North Whitehead and Bertrand Russell over several years, and published
in three volumes, which appeared between 1910 and 1913. It presents a
system of symbolic logic and then turns to the foundations of
mathematics to carry out the logicist project of defining mathematical
notions in terms of logical notions and proving the fundamental axioms
of mathematics as theorems of logic. While hugely important in the
development of logic, philosophy of mathematics and more broadly of
&ldquo;Early Analytic Philosophy&rdquo;, the work itself is no longer
studied for these topics. As a result the very notation of the work
has become alien to contemporary students of logic, and that has
become a barrier to the study of <em>Principia Mathematica</em>.</p>

<p>
This entry is intended to assist the student of PM in reading the
symbolic portion of the work. What follows is a partial translation of
the symbolism into a more contemporary notation, which should be
familiar from other articles in this Encyclopedia, and which is quite
standard in contemporary textbooks of symbolic logic. No complete
algorithm is supplied, rather various suggestions are intended to help
the reader learn the symbolism of PM. Many issues of interpretation
would be prejudged by only using contemporary notation, and many
details that are unique to PM depend on that notation. It will be seen
below, with some of the more contentious aspects of the notation, that
doctrines of substance are built into the notation of PM. Replacing
the notation with a more modern symbolism would drastically alter the
very content of the book.</p>

<h2 id="PrimSymb">2. Primitive Symbols</h2>

<p>
Below the reader will find, in the order in which they are introduced
in PM, the following symbols, which are briefly described. More detail
is provided in what follows:</p>

<table class="center cell-rl cellpad-med vert-top">
<tr>
  <td>&lowast;</td>
  <td>pronounced &ldquo;star&rdquo;; indicates a number, or chapter,
as in &lowast;1, or &lowast;20. </td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>&middot;</td>
  <td>a centered dot (an old British decimal point); indicates a
numbered sentence in the order by first digit (all the 0s preceding
all the 1s etc.), then second digit, and so on. The first definitions
and propositions of &lowast;1 illustrate this &ldquo;lexicographical&rdquo;
ordering: 1&middot;01, 1&middot;1, 1&middot;11, 1&middot;2,
1&middot;3, 1&middot;4, 1&middot;5, 1&middot;6, 1&middot;7,
1&middot;71, 1&middot;72. </td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\vdash\)</td>
  <td>the assertion-sign; indicates an <em>assertion</em>, either an
<em>axiom</em> (i.e., a <em>primitive proposition</em>, which are also
annotated &ldquo;\(\Pp\)&rdquo;) or a <em>theorem</em>.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\Df\)</td>
  <td>the definition sign; follows a <em>definition</em>.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(.\),&nbsp;&nbsp; \( :\),&nbsp;&nbsp; \(:.\),&nbsp;&nbsp;
\(::\),&nbsp; etc.</td>
  <td>are dots used for delimiting punctuation; in contemporary logic,
we use ( ), [ ], \(\{\ \}\), etc. </td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(p, q, r\), etc.</td>
  <td>are <em>propositional variables</em>.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\lor\), \(\supset\), \(\osim \), \(\equiv\), \(\sdot\)</td>
  <td>are the familiar sentential <em>connectives</em>, corresponding
to &ldquo;<em>or</em>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<em>if-then</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>not</em>&rdquo;,
&ldquo;<em>if and only if</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>and</em>&rdquo;,
respectively. [In the Second Edition of PM, 1925&ndash;27, the Sheffer
Stroke &ldquo;\(\mid\)&rdquo; is the one primitive connective. It
means &ldquo;<em>not both</em> &hellip; <em>and</em> ___&rdquo;.]
</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(x, y, z\), etc.</td>
  <td>are <em>individual variables</em>, which are to be read with
&ldquo;typical ambiguity&rdquo;, i.e., with their <em>logical
types</em> to be filled in (see below).</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(a, b, c\), etc.</td>
  <td>are <em>individual constants</em>, and stand for individuals (of
the lowest type). These occur only in the Introduction to PM, and not
in the official system.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(xRy, aRb, R(x)\), etc.</td>
  <td>are <em>atomic predications</em>, in which the objects named by
the variables or constants stand in the relation \(R\) or have the
property \(R\). These occur only in the Introduction.
&ldquo;\(a\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;\(b\)&rdquo; occur as constants only in
the Second Edition. The predications \(R(x), R(x,y)\), etc., are used
only in the Second Edition.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\phi\), \(\psi\), \(\chi\), etc.,
<br />
and \(f, g\), etc.</td>
  <td>are variables which range over <em>propositional functions</em>,
no matter whether those functions are simple or complex. </td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\phi x\), \(\psi x\), \(\phi(x,y)\), etc.</td>
  <td>open atomic formulas in which both &ldquo;\(x\)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;\(\phi\)&rdquo; are free. [An alternative interpretation is to
view &ldquo;\(\phi x\)&rdquo; as a schematic letter standing for a
formula in which the variable &ldquo;\(x\)&rdquo; is free.] </td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\hat{\phantom{x}}\)</td>
  <td>the circumflex; when placed over a variable in an open formula
(as in &ldquo;\(\phi \hat{x}\)&rdquo;) results in a term for a
function. [This matter is controversial. See Landini 1998.] When the
circumflected variable precedes a complex variable, the result
indicates a class, as in \(\hat{x}\phi x\).</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\phi\hat{x}, \psi\hat{x}, \phi(\hat{x},\hat{z}),\) etc.</td>
  <td>Terms for propositional functions. Here are examples of such
terms which are constants: &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is happy&rdquo;,
&ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is bald and \(\hat{x}\) is happy&rdquo;, &ldquo;\(4
\lt \hat{x} \lt 6\)&rdquo;, etc. If we apply, for example, the
function &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is bald and \(\hat{x}\) is happy&rdquo; to
the particular individual \(b\), the result is the proposition
&ldquo;\(b\) is bald and \(b\) is happy&rdquo;. </td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\exists\) and (&nbsp;)</td>
  <td>are the <em>quantifiers</em> &ldquo;there exists&rdquo; and
&ldquo;for all&rdquo; (&ldquo;every&rdquo;), respectively. For
example, where \(\phi x\) is a simple or complex open formula,

<table class="cellpad-med">
<tr>
  <td>\((\exists x)\phi x\)</td>
  <td>asserts</td>
  <td>&ldquo;there exists an \(x\) such that \(\phi x\)&rdquo;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>\((\exists \phi)\phi x\)</td>
  <td>asserts</td>
  <td>&ldquo;there exists a propositional function \(\phi\) such that
\(\phi x\)&rdquo;</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\((x)\phi x\)</td>
  <td>asserts</td>
  <td>&ldquo;every \(x\) is such that \(\phi x\)&rdquo;</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\((\phi)\phi x\)</td>
  <td>asserts</td>
  <td>&ldquo;every propositional function \(\phi\) is such that \(\phi
x\)&rdquo;</td> </tr>
</table>

<p>
[These were used by Peano. More recently, \(\forall\) has been added
for symmetry with \(\exists\). Some scholars see the quantfiers
\((\phi)\) and \((\exists \phi\)) as substitutional.]</p></td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\phi x \supset_x \psi x\)
<br />
\(\phi x \equiv_x \psi x\)</td>
  <td>This is notation that is used to abbreviate universally
quantified variables. In modern notation, these become \(\forall
x(\phi x \supset \psi x)\) and \(\forall x(\phi x \equiv \psi x)\),
respectively. See the definitions for this notation at the end of
 <a href="#ForcConn">Section 3.2</a>
 below.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\bang\)</td>
  <td>pronounced &ldquo;shriek&rdquo;; indicates that a function is
<em>predicative</em>, as in \(\phi \bang x\) or \(\phi\bang \hat{x}\).
See
 <a href="#PredFuncIden">Section 7</a>.</td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td>=</td>
  <td>the identity symbol; expresses <em>identity</em>, which is a
defined notion in PM, not primitive as in contemporary logic.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\atoi\)</td>
  <td>read as &ldquo;the&rdquo;; is the inverted <em>iota</em> or
<em>description operator</em> and is used in expressions for definite
descriptions, such as \((\atoi x)\phi x\) (which is read: the \(x\)
such that \(\phi x\)).</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>[\((\atoi x)\phi x\)]</td>
  <td>a definite description in brackets; this is a <em>scope
indicator</em> for definite descriptions.</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(E\bang \)</td>
  <td> is defined at &lowast;14&middot;02, in the context \(E\bang (\atoi
x)\phi x\), to mean that the description \((\atoi x)\phi x\) is
<em>proper</em>, i.e., there is exactly one \(\phi\).</td> </tr>
<tr>
  <td>\(\exists\bang \)</td>
  <td>is defined at &lowast;24&middot;03, in the context \(\exists \bang
\alpha\), to mean that the class \(\alpha\) is <em>non-empty</em>,
i.e., has a member.</td> </tr>
</table>

<h2 id="UseDotsForPunc">3. The Use of Dots for Punctuation</h2>

<p>
An immediate obstacle to reading PM is the unfamiliar use of dots for
punctuation, instead of the more common parentheses and brackets. The
system is precise, and can be learned with just a little practice. The
use of dots for punctuation is not unique to PM. Originating with
Peano, it was later used in works by Alonzo Church, W.V.O. Quine, and
others, but it has now largely disappeared. (The use of dots of some
historical interest, as Alan Turing made a study of the use of dots
from a computational point of view in 1942, presumably in his spare
time after a day's work at Bletchley Park breaking the codes of the
Enigma Machine.) The best way to learn to use it is to look at a few
samples which are translated to formulae using parentheses, and thus
to get the feel for it. What follows is an explanation as presented in
PM, pages 9&ndash;10, followed by a number of examples which
illustrate each of its clauses:</p>

<blockquote>
The use of dots. Dots on the line of the symbols have two uses, one to
bracket off propositions, the other to indicate the logical product of
two propositions. Dots immediately preceded or followed by
&ldquo;\(\lor\)&rdquo; or &ldquo;\(\supset\)&rdquo; or
&ldquo;\(\equiv\)&rdquo; or &ldquo;\(\vdash\)&rdquo;, or by
&ldquo;\((x)\)&rdquo;, &ldquo;\((x,y)\)&rdquo;,
&ldquo;\((x,y,z)\)&rdquo; &hellip; or &ldquo;\((\exists x)\)&rdquo;,
&ldquo;\((\exists x,y)\)&rdquo;, &ldquo;\((\exists x,y,z)\)&rdquo;
&hellip; or &ldquo;\([(\atoi x)(\phi x)]\)&rdquo; or
&ldquo;\([R&lsquo;y]\)&rdquo; or analogous expressions, serve to
bracket off a proposition; dots occurring otherwise serve to mark a
logical product. The general principle is that a larger number of dots
indicates an outside bracket, a smaller number indicates an inside
bracket. The exact rule as to the scope of the bracket indicated by
dots is arrived at by dividing the occurrences of dots into three
groups which we will name I, II, and III. Group I consists of dots
adjoining a sign of implication \((\supset)\) or equivalence
\((\equiv)\) or of disjunction \(\lor)\) or of equality by definition
\((=\Df)\). Group II consists of dots following brackets indicative of
an apparent variable, such as \((x)\) or \((x,y)\) or \((\exists x)\)
or \((\exists x,y)\) or \([(\atoi x)(\phi x)]\) or analogous
expressions. Group III consists of dots which stand between
propositions in order to indicate a logical product. Group I is of
greater force than Group II, and Group II than Group III. The scope of
the bracket indicated by any collection of dots extends backwards or
forwards beyond any smaller number of dots, or any equal number from a
group of less force, until we reach either the end of the asserted
proposition or a greater number of dots or an equal number belonging
to a group of equal or superior force. Dots indicating a logical
product have a scope which works both backwards and forwards; other
dots only work away from the adjacent sign of disjunction,
implication, or equivalence, or forward from the adjacent symbol of
one of the other kinds enumerated in Group II. Some examples will
serve to illustrate the use of dots. (PM, 9&ndash;10)
</blockquote>

<h3 id="SomeBasiExam">3.1 Some Basic Examples</h3>

<p>
Consider the following series of extended examples, in which we
examine propositions in PM and then discuss how to translate them step
by step into modern notation. (Symbols below are sometimes used as
names for themselves, thus avoiding some otherwise needed quotation
marks. Russell is often accused of confusing use and mention, so there
may well be some danger in this practice.)
</p>

<h4>Example 1</h4> 

\[\tag*{&lowast;1&middot;2}
{\vdash} \colon p \lor p \ldot {\supset} \ldot p \quad\Pp
\]

<p>
This is the second assertion of &ldquo;star&rdquo; 1. It is in fact an
axiom or &ldquo;Primitive Proposition&rdquo; as indicated by the
&rsquo;\(\Pp\)&rsquo;. That this is an assertion (axiom or theorem)
and not a definition is indicated by the use of
&ldquo;\(\vdash\)&rdquo;. (By contrast, a definition would omit the
assertion sign but conclude with a &ldquo;\(\Df\)&rdquo; sign.) Now
the first step in the process of translating &lowast;1&middot;2 into modern
notation is to note the colon. Recall, from the above quoted passage,
that &ldquo;a larger number of dots indicates an outside bracket, a
smaller number indicates an inside bracket&rdquo;. Thus, the colon
here (which consists of a larger number of dots than the single dots
occurring on the line in &lowast;1&middot;2) represents an outside bracket.
So, the first step is to translate &lowast;1&middot;2 to: </p> 

\[
\vdash[ p \lor p \ldot {\supset} \ldot p]
\]

<p>
So the brackets &ldquo;[&rdquo; and &ldquo;]&rdquo; represent the
colon in &lowast;1&middot;2. The scope of the colon thus extends past
any smaller number of dots (i.e., one dot) to the end of the
formula. Since formulas are read from left to right the expression
&ldquo;past&rdquo; means &ldquo;to the right of&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Next, the dots around the &ldquo;\(\supset\)&rdquo; are represented in
modern notation by the parenthesis around the antecedent and
consequent. Recall, in the above passage, we find &ldquo;&hellip; dots
only work away from the adjacent sign of disjunction, implication, or
equivalence &hellip;&rdquo;. Thus, the next step in the translation
process is to move to the formula: 

\[
\vdash [(p \lor p) \supset(p)]
\]

 </p>

<p>
Finally, standard modern conventions allow us to delete the outer
brackets and the parentheses around single letters, yielding:</p>

\[
\vdash(p \lor p) \supset p
\]

<p>
Our next example involves conjunction, which is indicated by simple
juxtaposition of atomic sentences, or with a dot when a substitution
instance might be considered, as in the definition of conjunction in
the following:</p>

<h4>Example 2</h4> 

\[
  \tag*{&lowast;3&middot;01}
  p \sdot  q \ldot {=} \ldot  \osim(\osim p \lor \osim q)
   \quad\Df
\]

<p>
Here we have a case in which dots occur indicate both a &ldquo;logical
product&rdquo; (i.e., conjunction) and delimiting brackets. As a first
step in translating &lowast;3&middot;01 into modern notation, we replace the
first dot by an ampersand (and its corresponding scope delimiters) and
replace &ldquo;\(\ldot {=} \ldot\)&rdquo; by &ldquo;\(=_{df}\)&rdquo;,
to yield: </p> 

\[
(p \amp q) =_{df} [\osim (\osim p \lor \osim q)]
\]

<p>
The above step clearly illustrates how a &ldquo;dot indicating a
logical product has a scope which works both backwards and
forwards&rdquo;. Note that the first dot in &lowast;3&middot;01, i.e.,
between the \(p\) and \(q\), is really optional, given the above
quotation from PM. However, since we may sometimes want to substitute
entire formulas for \(p\) and \(q\), the dot indicates the extent of
the substituted formulas. Thus, we might have, as a substitution
instance: \(r \lor s \sdot q \supset s\) (in PM notation) or \((r \lor
s) \amp(q \supset s)\) (in contemporary symbols).</p>

<p>
Finally, our modern conventions allow us to eliminate the outer
parentheses from the definiendum and the brackets &ldquo;[&rdquo; and
&ldquo;]&rdquo; from the definiens, yielding: </p> 

\[
p \amp q =_{df} \osim (\osim p \lor \osim q)
\]

<p>
Notice that the scope of the negation sign &ldquo;\(\osim \)&rdquo; in
&lowast;3&middot;01 is not indicated with dots, even in the PM system, but
rather requires parentheses.</p>

<h4>Example 3</h4> 

\[
\tag*{&lowast;9&middot;01}
 \osim \{(x) \sdot  \phi x\} \ldot {=} \ldot  (\exists x) \sdot  \osim \phi x
 \quad\Df
\]

<p>
If we apply the rule &ldquo;dots only work away from the adjacent sign
of disjunction, implication, or equivalence, or forward from the
adjacent symbol of one of the other kinds enumerated in Group
II&rdquo; (where Group II includes &ldquo;\((\exists x)\)&rdquo;),
then the modern equivalent would be: 

\[
\osim (x)\phi x =_{df} (\exists x)\osim \phi x
\]

 or 

\[
\osim \forall x\phi x =_{df} \exists x\osim \phi x
\]</p>

<h3 id="ForcConn">3.2 The Force of Connectives</h3>

<p>
The ranking of connectives in terms of relative &ldquo;force&rdquo;,
or <em>scope</em>, is a standard convention in contemporary logic. If
there are no explicit parentheses to indicate the scope of a
connective those which have precedence in the ranking are presumed to
be the principal connective, and so on for subformulas. Thus, instead
formulating the following DeMorgan&rsquo;s law as the cumbersome:</p>

\[
[(\osim p) \lor (\osim q)] \equiv[\osim (p \amp q)]
\]

<p>
we nowadays write it as:</p> 

\[
\osim p \lor \osim q \equiv\osim (p \amp q)
\]

<p>
This simpler formulation is natural because \(\equiv\) takes
precedence over (has wider &ldquo;scope&rdquo; than) \(\lor\) and
&amp;, and the latter take precedence over \(\osim \). Indeed
parentheses are often unneeded around \(\equiv\), given a further
convention on which \(\equiv\) takes precedence over \(\supset\).
Thus, the formula \(p \supset q \equiv\osim p\lor q\) becomes
unambiguous. We might represent these conventions by listing the
connectives in groups with those with widest scope at the top: </p>

\[\begin{array}{c}
\equiv \\
\supset \\
\amp, \lor \\
\osim 
\end{array}\]

<p>
For Whitehead and Russell, however, the symbols \(\supset\),
\(\equiv\), \(\lor\) and \(\ldots =\ldots \Df\), in Group I, are of
equal force. Group II consists of the variable binding expressions,
quantifiers and scope indicators for definite descriptions, and Group
III consists of conjunctions. Negation is below all of these. So the
ranking in PM would be:</p>

\[\begin{array}{c}
\supset, \equiv, \lor \text{ and } \ldots =\ldots \quad\Df \\
(x), (x,y) \ldots (\exists x), (\exists x,y) \ldots [(\atoi x)\phi x] \\
p \sdot q \quad \text{(conjunction)} \\
\osim 
\end{array}\]

<p>
This is what Whitehead and Russell seem to mean when they say
&ldquo;Group I is of greater force than Group II, and Group II than
Group III.&rdquo; Consider the following:</p>

<h4>Example 4</h4> 

\[
\tag*{&lowast;3&middot;12}
  {\vdash} \colon  \osim p \ldot {\lor} \ldot \osim q \ldot {\lor} \ldot p \sdot  q
\]

<p>
This theorem illustrates how to read multiple uses of the same number
of dots within one formula. Grouping &ldquo;associates to the
left&rdquo; both for dots and for a series of disjunctions, following
the convention of reading from left to right and the definition:</p>

\[
\tag*{&lowast;2&middot;33} p \vee q \vee r \ldot {=} \ldot (p \vee q) \vee r \quad\Df
\]

<p>
So, in &lowast;3&middot;12, the first two dots around the \(\lor\)
simply &ldquo;work away&rdquo; from the connective. The second
&ldquo;extends&rdquo; until it meets with the next of the same number
(the third single dot). That third dot, and the fourth &ldquo;work
away&rdquo; from the second \(\lor\), and the final dot indicates a
conjunction with narrowest scope. The result, formulated with all
possible punctuation for maximum explicitness, is:</p> 

\[
\{[(\osim p) \lor (\osim q)] \lor (p \amp q)\}
\]

<p>
If we employ all the standard conventions for dropping parentheses,
this becomes:</p> 

\[
(\osim p \lor \osim  q) \lor (p \amp q)
\]

<p>
This illustrates the passage in the above quotation which says
&ldquo;The scope of the bracket indicated by any collection of dots
extends backwards or forwards beyond any smaller number of dots, or
any equal number from a group of less force, until we reach either the
end of the asserted proposition or a greater number of dots or an
equal number belonging to a group of equal or superior
force.&rdquo;</p>

<p>
Before we look at a wider range of examples, a detailed example
involving quantified variables will prove to be instructive. Whitehead
and Russell follow Peano&rsquo;s practice of expressing universally
quantified conditionals (such as &ldquo;All \(\phi\)s are
\(\psi\)s&rdquo;) with the bound variable subscripted under the
conditional sign. Similarly with universally quantified biconditionals
(&ldquo;All and only \(\phi\)s are \(\psi\)s&rdquo;). That is, the
expressions &ldquo;\(\phi x \supset_x \psi x\)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;\(\phi x \equiv_x \psi x\)&rdquo; are defined as follows:</p>

\[
\tag*{&lowast;10&middot;02} 
\phi x \supset_x \psi x \ldot {=} \ldot (x) \ldot \phi x \supset \psi x  \quad\Df
\]

 

\[
\tag*{&lowast;10&middot;03}
 \phi x \equiv_x \psi x \ldot {=} \ldot  (x)  \ldot \phi x \equiv \psi x  \quad\Df 
\]

<p>
and correspond to the following more modern formulas,
respectively:</p> 

\[
\forall x(\phi x \supset \psi x)
\] 

 

\[
\forall x(\phi x \equiv \psi x)
\]

<p>
As an exercise the reader might be inclined to formulate a rigorous
algorithm for converting PM into a particular contemporary symbolism
(with conventions for dropping parentheses), but the best way to learn
the system is to look over a few more examples of translations, and
then simply begin to read formulae directly.</p>

<h3 id="Exam">3.3 More Examples</h3>

<p>
In the examples below, each formula number is followed first by
<em>Principia</em> notation and then its modern translation. Notice
that in &lowast;1&middot;5 parentheses are used for punctuation in addition
to dots. (Primitive Propositions &lowast;1&middot;2, &lowast;1&middot;3,
&lowast;1&middot;4, &lowast;1&middot;5, and &lowast;1&middot;6 together constitute the
axioms for propositional logic in PM. ) Proposition &lowast;1&middot;5 was
shown to be redundant by Paul Bernays in 1926. It can be derived from
appropriate instances of the others and the rule of modus ponens.</p>

<h2 id="PropFunc">4. Propositional Functions</h2>

<p>
There are two kinds of functions in PM. Propositional functions such
as &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is a natural number&rdquo; are to be
distinguished from the more familiar mathematical functions, which are
called &ldquo;descriptive functions&rdquo; (PM, 31). Descriptive
functions are defined using relations and definite descriptions.
Examples of descriptive functions are \(x + y\) and &ldquo;the
successor of \(n\)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>
Focusing on propositional functions, Whitehead and Russell distinguish
between expressions with a free variable (such as &ldquo;\(x\) is
hurt&rdquo;) and names of functions (such as &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is
hurt&rdquo;) (PM, 14&ndash;15). The propositions which result from the
formula by assigning allowable values to the free variable
&ldquo;x&rdquo; are said to be the &ldquo;ambiguous values&rdquo; of
the function. Expressions using the circumflex notation, such as
\(\phi \hat{x}\) only occur in the introductory material in the
technical sections of PM and not in the technical sections themselves
(with the exception of the sections on the theory of classes),
prompting some scholars to say that such expressions do not really
occur in the formal system of PM. This issue is distinct from that
surrounding the interpretation of such symbols. Are they
&ldquo;term-forming operators&rdquo; which turn an open formula into a
name for a function, or simply a syntactic device, a placeholder, for
indicating the variable for which a substitution can made in an open
formula? If they are to be treated as term-forming operators, the
modern notation for \(\phi \hat{x}\) would be &ldquo;\(\lambda x\phi
x\)&rdquo;. The \(\lambda\)-notation has the advantage of clearly
revealing that the variable \(x\) is <em>bound</em> by the
term-forming operator \(\lambda\), which takes a predicate \(\phi\)
and yields a term \(\lambda x\phi x\) (which in some logics is a
singular term that can occur in the subject position of a sentence,
while in other logics is a complex predicative expression). Unlike
\(\lambda\)-notation, the PM notation using the circumflex cannot
indicate scope. The function expression
&ldquo;\(\phi(\hat{x},\hat{z}\))&rdquo; is ambiguous between
&ldquo;\(\lambda x\lambda y\phi xy\)&rdquo; and &ldquo;\(\lambda
y\lambda x\phi xy\)&rdquo;, without some further convention. Indeed,
Whitehead and Russell specified this convention for relations in
extension (on p. 200 in the introductory material of &lowast;21, in terms of
the order of the variables), but the ambiguity it brought out most
clearly by using \(\lambda\) notation: the first denotes the relation
of being an \(x\) and \(y\) such that \(\phi xy\) and the second
denotes the converse relation of being a \(y\) and \(x\) such that
\(\phi xy\).</p>

<h2 id="MissNotaForTypeOrde">5. The Missing Notation for Types and Orders</h2>

<p>
This section explains notation that is not in <em>Principia
Mathematica</em>. Except for some notation for &ldquo;relative&rdquo;
types in Volume II, there are famously no symbols for types in
<em>Principia Mathematica</em>! Sentences are generally to be taken as
&ldquo;typically ambiguous&rdquo; and so standing for expressions of a
whole range of types and so just as there are no individual or
predicate constants, there are no particular functions of any specific
type. So not only does one not see how to symbolize the argument:</p>

<p class="indent">
All men are mortal
<br />
Socrates is a man
<br />
Therefore, Socrates is mortal
</p>

<p>
but also there is no indication of the logical type of the function
&ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is mortal&rdquo;. The project of PM is to reduce
mathematics to logic, and part of the view of logic behind this
project is that logical truths are all completely general. The
derivation of truths of mathematics from definitions and truths of
logic will thus not involve any particular constants other than those
introduced by definition from purely logical notion. As a result no
notation is included in PM for describing those types. Those of us who
wish to consider PM as a logic which can be applied, must supplement
it with some indication of types.</p>

<p>
Readers should note that the explanation of types outlined below is
not going to correspond with the statements about types in the text of
PM. Alonzo Church [1976] developed a simple, rational reconstruction
of the notation for both the simple and ramified theory of types as
implied by the text of PM. (There are alternative, equivalent
notations for the theory of types.) The full theory can be seen as a
development of the <em>simple theory of types</em>. </p>

<h3 id="SimpType">5.1 Simple Types</h3>

<p>
A definition of the simple types can be given as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\iota\) (Greek iota) is the type for an <em>individual</em>.
</li>

<li>Where \(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n\) are any types, then
\(\ulcorner(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n)\urcorner\) is the type of a
propositional function whose arguments are of types
\(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_n\), respectively.</li>

<li>\(\ulcorner\)(&nbsp;)\(\urcorner\) is the type of propositions.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Here are some intuitive ways to understand the definition of type.
Suppose that &ldquo;Socrates&rdquo; names an individual. (We are here
ignoring Russell&rsquo;s considered opinion that such ordinary
individuals are in fact classes of classes of sense data, and so of a
much higher type.) Then the individual constant &ldquo;Socrates&rdquo;
would be of type \(\iota\). A monadic propositional function which
takes individuals as arguments is of type \((\iota)\). Suppose that
&ldquo;is mortal&rdquo; is a predicate expressing such a function. The
function &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is mortal&rdquo; will also be of type
\((\iota)\). A two-place or <em>binary</em> relation between
individuals is of type \((\iota,\iota)\). Thus, a relation expression
like &ldquo;parent of&rdquo; and the function &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is a
parent of \(\hat{z}\)&rdquo; will be of type \((\iota,\iota)\). </p>

<p>
Propositional functions of type \((\iota)\) are often called
&ldquo;first order&rdquo;; hence the name &ldquo;first order
logic&rdquo; for the familiar logic where the variables only range
over arguments of first order functions. A monadic function of
arguments of type \(\tau\) are of type \((\tau)\) and so functions of
such functions are of type \(((\tau))\). &ldquo;Second order
logic&rdquo; will have variables for the arguments of such functions
(as well as variables for individuals). Binary relations between
functions of type \(\tau\) are of type \((\tau,\tau)\), and so on, for
relations of having more than 2 arguments. Mixed types are defined by
the above. A relation between an individual and a proposition (such as
&ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) believes that \(\hat{P}\)&rdquo;) will be of type
\((\iota\),(&nbsp;)).</p>

<h3 id="RamiType">5.2 Ramified Types</h3>

<p>
To construct a notation for the full ramified theory of types of PM,
another piece of information must be encoded in the symbols. Church
calls the resulting system one of <em>r-types</em>. The key idea of
ramified types is that any function defined using quantification over
functions of some given type has to be of a higher &ldquo;order&rdquo;
than those functions. To use Russell&rsquo;s example:</p>

<p class="center">
\(\hat{x}\) has all the qualities that great generals have
</p>

<p>
is a function true of persons (i.e., individuals), and from the point
of view of <em>simple</em> type theory, it has the same simple logical
type as particular qualities of individuals (such as bravery and
decisiveness). However, in ramified type theory, the above function
will be of a higher order than those particular qualities of
individuals, since unlike those particular qualities, it involves a
quantification over those qualities. So, whereas the expression
&ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is brave&rdquo; denotes a function of r-type
\((\iota)/1\), the expression &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) has all the qualities
that great generals have&rdquo; will have r-type \((\iota)/2\). In
these r-types, the number after the &ldquo;/&rdquo; indicates the
<em>level</em> of the function. The order of the functions will be
defined and computed given the following definitions.</p>

<p>
Church defines the r-types as follows:</p>

<ul>

<li>\(\iota\) (Greek iota) is the r-type for an <em>individual</em>.
</li>

<li>Where \(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_m\) are any r-types,
\(\ulcorner(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_m)/n\urcorner\) is an r-type; this is
the r-type of a \(m\)-ary propositional function of <em>level</em>
\(n\), which has arguments of r-types \(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_m\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
The <em>order</em> of an entity is defined as follows (here we no
longer follow Church, for he defines orders for variables, i.e.,
expressions, instead of orders for the things the variables range
over):</p>

<ul>

<li>the order of an individual (of r-type \(\iota)\) is 0,</li>

<li>the order of a function of r-type \((\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_m)/n\) is
\(n+N\), where \(N\) is the greatest of the order of the arguments
\(\tau_1,\ldots,\tau_m\).</li>
</ul>

<p>
These two definitions are supplemented with a principle which
identifies the levels of particular defined functions, namely, that
the level of a defined function should be one higher than the highest
order entity having a name or variable that appears in the definition
of that function.</p>

<p>
To see how these definitions and principles can be used to compute the
order of the function &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) has all the qualities that
great generals have&rdquo;, note that the function can be represented
as follows, where &ldquo;\(x, y\)&rdquo; are variables ranging over
individuals of r-type \(\iota\) (order 0),
&ldquo;GreatGeneral\((y)\)&rdquo; is a predicate denoting a
propositional function of r-type \((\iota)/1\) (and so of order 1),
and &ldquo;\(\phi\)&rdquo; is a variable ranging over propositional
functions of r-type \((\iota)/1\) (and so of order 1) such as
<em>great general</em>, <em>bravery</em>, <em>leadership</em>,
<em>skill</em>, <em>foresight</em>, etc.:</p> 

\[
(\phi)\{[(y)(\textrm{GreatGeneral}(y) \supset \phi(y)] \supset \phi \hat{x} \}
\]

<p>
We first note that given the above principle, the r-type of this
function is \((\iota)/2\); the level is 2 because the level of the
r-type of this function has to be one higher than the highest order of
any entity named (or in the range of a variable used) in the
definition. In this case, the denotation of GreatGeneral, and the
range of the variable &ldquo;\(\phi\)&rdquo;, is of order 1, and no
other expression names or ranges over an entity of higher order. Thus,
the level of the function named above is defined to be 2. Finally, we
compute the order of the function denoted above as it was defined: the
sum of the level plus the greatest of the orders of the arguments of
the above function. Since the only arguments in the above function are
individuals (of order 0), the order of our function is just 2. </p>

<p>
Quantifying over functions of r-type \((\tau)/n\) of order \(k\) in a
definition of a new function yields a function of r-type
\((\tau)/n+1\), and so a function of order one higher, \(k+1\). Two
kinds of functions, then, can be of the <em>second order</em>: (1)
functions of first-order functions of individuals, of r-type
\(((\iota)/1)/1\), and (2) functions of r-type \((\iota)/2\), such as
our example &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) has all the qualities that great
generals have&rdquo;. This latter will be a function true of
individuals such as Napoleon, but of a higher order than simple
functions such as &ldquo;\(\hat{x}\) is brave&rdquo;, which are of
r-type \((\iota)/1\).</p>

<p>
Logicians today use a different notion of &ldquo;order&rdquo;. Today,
first-order logic is a logic with only variables for individuals.
Second order logic is a logic with variables for both individuals and
properties of individuals. Third-order logic is a logic with variables
for individuals, properties of individuals, and properties of
properties of individuals. And so forth. By contrast, Church would
call these logics, respectively, the logic of functions of the types
\((\iota)/1\) and \((\iota,\ldots,\iota)/1\), the logic of functions
of the types \(((\iota)/1)/1\) and
\(((\iota,\ldots,\iota)/1,\ldots,(\iota,\ldots,\iota)/1)/1\), and the
logic of functions of the types \((((\iota)/1)/1)/1\) etc. (i.e., the
level-one functions of the functions of the preceding type). Given
Church&rsquo;s definitions, these are logics of first-, second- and
third-order functions, respectively, thus coinciding with the modern
terminology of &ldquo;\(n\)<sup>th</sup>-order logic&rdquo;.</p>

<h2 id="Vari">6. Variables</h2>

<p>
As mentioned previously, there are no individual or predicate
constants in the formal system of PM, only variables. The
Introduction, however, makes use of the example &ldquo;\(a\) standing
in the relation \(R\) to \(b\)&rdquo; in a discussion of atomic facts
(PM, 43). Although &ldquo;\(R\)&rdquo; is later used as a variable
that ranges over relations in extension, and
&ldquo;\(a,b,c,\ldots\)&rdquo; are individual variables, let us
temporarily add them to the system as predicate and individual
constants, respectively, in order to discuss the use of variables in
PM.</p>

<p>
PM makes special use of the distinction between &ldquo;real&rdquo;, or
free, variables and &ldquo;apparent&rdquo;, or bound, variables. Since
&ldquo;\(x\)&rdquo; is a variable, &ldquo;\(xRy\)&rdquo; will be an
atomic formula in our extended language, with &ldquo;\(x\)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;\(y\)&rdquo; real variables. When such formulae are combined
with the propositional connectives \(\osim\), \(\lor\), etc., the
result is a <em>matrix</em>. For example, &ldquo;\(aRx \ldot {\lor}
\ldot xRy\)&rdquo; would be a matrix.</p>

<p>
As we saw earlier, there are also variables which range over
functions: &ldquo;\(\phi\), \(\psi\), \(\ldots,f, g\)&rdquo;, etc. The
expression &ldquo;\(\phi x\)&rdquo; thus contains two variables and
stands for a proposition, in particular, the result of applying the
function \(\phi\) to the individual \(x\).</p>

<p>
Theorems are stated with real variables, which gives them a special
significance with regard to the theory. For example,</p> 

\[
\tag*{&lowast;10&middot;1}
 \vdash \colon (x) \ldot \phi x \ldot {\supset} \ldot \phi y \quad\Pp
\]

<p>
is a fundamental axiom of the quantificational theory of PM. In this
Primitive Proposition the variables &ldquo;\(\phi\)&rdquo; and
&ldquo;\(y\)&rdquo; are real (free), and the &ldquo;\(x\)&rdquo; is
apparent (bound). As there are no constants in the system, this is the
closest that PM comes to a rule of universal instantiation.</p>

<p>
Whitehead and Russell interpret &ldquo;\((x) \sdot \phi x\)&rdquo; as
&ldquo;the proposition which asserts <em>all</em> the values for
\(\phi \hat{x}\)&rdquo; (PM 41). The use of the word &ldquo;all&rdquo;
has special significance within the theory of types. They present the
&ldquo;vicious circle principle&rdquo;, which underlies the theory of
types, as asserting that</p>

<blockquote>
&hellip; generally, given any set of objects such that, if we suppose
the set to have a total, it will contain members which presuppose this
total, then such as set cannot have a total. By saying that the set
has &ldquo;no total&rdquo;, we mean, primarily, that no significant
statement can be made about &ldquo;all its members&rdquo;. (PM, 37)
</blockquote>

<p>
Specifically, then, a quantified expression, since it talks about
&ldquo;all&rdquo; the members of a totality, must range over a
specific logical type in order to observe the vicious circle
principle. Thus, when interpreting a bound variable, we must assume
that it ranges over a specific type of entity, and so types must be
assigned to the other entities represented by expressions in the
formula, in observance with the theory of types.</p>

<p>
A question arises, however, once one realizes that the statements of
primitive propositions and theorems in PM such as &lowast;10&middot;1 are
taken to be &ldquo;typically ambiguous&rdquo; (i.e., ambiguous with
respect to type). These statements are actually schematic and
represent all the possible specific assertions which can be derived
from them by interpreting types appropriately. But if statements like
&lowast;10&middot;1 are schemata and yet have bound variables, how do we
assign types to the entities over which the bound variables range? The
answer is to first decide which type of thing the free variables in
the statement range over. For example, assuming that the variable
\(y\) in &lowast;10&middot;1 ranges over individuals (of type \(\iota)\),
then the variable \(\phi\) must range over functions of type
\((\iota)/n\), for some \(n\). Then the bound variable \(x\) will also
range over individuals. If, however, we assume that the variable \(y\)
in &lowast;10&middot;1 ranges over <em>functions</em> of type \((\iota)/1\),
then the variable \(\phi\) must range over functions of type
\(((\iota)/1)/m\), for some \(m\). In this case, the bound variable
\(x\) will range over functions of type \((\iota)/1\).</p>

<p>
So \(y\) and \(\phi\) are called &ldquo;real&rdquo; variables in
&lowast;10&middot;1 not only because they are free but also because they can
range over any type. Whitehead and Russell frequently say that real
variables are taken to ambiguously denote &ldquo;any&rdquo; of their
instances, while bound variables (which also ambiguously denote) range
over &ldquo;all&rdquo; of their instances (within a legitimate
totality, i.e. type).</p>

<h2 id="PredFuncIden">7. Predicative Functions and Identity</h2>

<p>
The exclamation mark &ldquo;!&rdquo; following a variable for a
function and preceding the argument, as in &ldquo;\(f\bang
\hat{x}\)&rdquo;, &ldquo;\(\phi \bang x\)&rdquo;, &ldquo;\(\phi\bang
\hat{x}\)&rdquo;, indicates that the function is <em>predicative</em>,
that is, of the lowest order which can apply to its arguments. In
Church&rsquo;s notation, this means that predicative functions are all
of the first level, with types of the form \((\ldots)/1\). As a
result, predicative functions will be of order one more than the
highest order of any of their arguments. This analysis is based on
quotations like the following, in the <em>Introduction</em> to PM:
</p>

<blockquote>
We will define a function of one variable as predicative when it is of
the next order above that of its argument, i.e., of the lowest order
compatible with its having that argument. (PM, 53)
</blockquote>

<p>
Unfortunately in the summary of &lowast;12, we find &ldquo;A predicative
function is one which contains no apparent variables, i.e., is a
matrix&rdquo; [PM, 167]. Reconciling this statement with that
definition in the <em>Introduction</em> is a problem for scholars.
</p>

<p>
To see the shriek notation in action, consider the following
definition of identity: </p> 

\[
\tag*{&lowast;13&middot;01}
 x = y \ldot {=} \colon (\phi) \colon \phi \bang x \ldot {\supset} \ldot \phi \bang  y \quad\Df 
\]

<p>
That is, \(x\) is identical with \(y\) if and only if \(y\) has every
predicative function \(\phi\) which is possessed by \(x\). (Of course
the second occurrence of &ldquo;=&rdquo; indicates a definition, and
does not independently have meaning. It is the first occurrence,
relating individuals \(x\) and \(y\), which is defined.) </p>

<p>
To see how this definition reduces to the more familiar definition of
identity (on which objects are identical iff they share the same
properties), we need the Axiom of Reducibility. The Axiom of
Reducibility states that for any function there is an equivalent
function (i.e., one true of all the same arguments) which is
predicative:</p>

<div class="indent">
Axiom of Reducibility: 
\[
\tag*{&lowast;12&middot;1}  \vdash \colon (\exists f) \colon \phi x \ldot {\equiv_x} \ldot  f\bang x  \quad\Pp
\]
</div>

<p>
To see how this axiom implies the more familiar definition of
identity, note that the more familiar definition of identity is:</p>

\[
 x = y \ldot {=} \colon (\phi) \colon \phi x \ldot {\supset} \ldot \phi y \quad\Df
\] 

<p>
for \(\phi\) of &ldquo;any&rdquo; type. (Note that this differs from
&lowast;13&middot;01 in that the shriek no longer appears.) Now to prove
this, assume both &lowast;13&middot;01 and the Axiom of Reducibility, and
suppose, for proof by <em>reductio</em>, that \(x = y\), and \(\phi
x\), and not \(\phi y\), for some function \(\phi\) of arbitrary type.
Then, the Axiom of Reducibility &lowast;12&middot;1 guarantees that there
will be a predicative function \(\psi \bang \), which is coextensive
with \(\phi\) such that \(\psi \bang x\) but not \(\psi \bang y\),
which contradicts &lowast;13&middot;01.</p>

<h2 id="DefiDesc">8. Definite Descriptions</h2>

<p>
The inverted Greek letter iota &ldquo;\(\atoi\)&rdquo; is used in PM,
always followed by a variable, to begin a definite description.
\((\atoi x) \phi x\) is read as &ldquo;the \(x\) such that \(x\) is
\(\phi\)&rdquo;, or more simply, as &ldquo;the \(\phi\)&rdquo;. Such
expressions may occur in subject position, as in \(\psi(\atoi x) \phi
x\), read as &ldquo;the \(\phi\) is \(\psi\)&rdquo;. The formal part
of Russell&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;theory of definite
descriptions&rdquo; consists of a definition of all formulas
&ldquo;&hellip;\(\psi(\atoi x) \phi x\)&hellip;&rdquo; in which a
description occurs. To distinguish the portion \(\psi\) from the rest
of a larger sentence (indicated by the ellipses above) in which the
expression \(\psi(\atoi x) \phi x\) occurs, the <em>scope</em> of the
description is indicated by repeating the definite description within
brackets:</p> 

\[
[(\atoi x) \phi x] \sdot  \psi(\atoi x) \phi x
\]

<p>
The notion of scope is meant to explain a distinction which Russell
famously discusses in &ldquo;On Denoting&rdquo; (1905). Russell says
that the sentence &ldquo;The present King of France is not bald&rdquo;
is ambiguous between two readings: (1) the reading where it says of
the present King of France that he is not bald, and (2) the reading on
which denies that the present King of France is bald. The former
reading requires that there be a unique King of France on the list of
things that are not bald, whereas the latter simply says that there is
not a unique King of France that appears on the list of bald things.
Russell says the latter, but not the former, can be true in a
circumstance in which there is no King of France. Russell analyzes
this difference as a matter of the scope of the definite description,
though as we shall see, some modern logicians tend to think of this
situation as a matter of the scope of the negation sign. Thus, Russell
introduces a method for indicating the scope of the definite
description.</p>

<p>
To see how Russell&rsquo;s method of scope works for this case, we
must understand the definition which introduces definite descriptions
(i.e., the inverted iota operator). Whitehead and Russell define:</p>

\[
\tag*{&lowast;14&middot;01}
 [(\atoi x) \phi x] \sdot  \psi(\atoi x) \phi x \ldot  {=} \colon (\exists b) \colon \phi x \ldot  {\equiv_x} \ldot  x=b \colon \psi b  \quad\Df
\]

<p>
This kind of definition is called a <em>contextual definition</em>,
which are to be contrasted with <em>explicit</em> definitions. An
explicit definition of the definition description would have to look
something like the following:</p> 

\[
(\atoi x)(\phi x) = \colon \ldots \quad\Df
\]

<p>
which would allow the definite description to be replaced in any
context by whichever defining expression fills in the ellipsis. By
contrast, &lowast;14&middot;01 shows how a sentence, in which there is
occurrence of a description \((\atoi x)(\phi x)\) in a context
\(\psi\), can be replaced by some other sentence (involving \(\phi\)
and \(\psi\)) which is equivalent. To develop an instance of this
definition, start with the following example:</p>

<p class="indent">
Example.
<br />
The present King of France is bald.
</p>

<p>
Using \(PKFx\) to represent the propositional function of being a
present King of France and \(B\) to represent the propositional
function of being bald, Whitehead and Russell would represent the
above claim as:</p> 

\[
[(\atoi x)(PKFx)] \sdot B(\atoi x)(PKFx)
\]

<p>
which by &lowast;14&middot;01 means:</p> 

\[
(\exists b) \colon PKFx \ldot {\equiv_x} \ldot  x=b \colon Bb
\]

<p>
In words, there is one and only one \(b\) which is a present King of
France and which is bald. In modern symbols, using \(b\)
non-standardly, as a variable, this becomes: </p> 

\[
(\exists b)[\forall x(PKFx \equiv x=b) \amp Bb]
\]

<p>
Now we return to the example which shows how the scope of the
description makes a difference:</p>

<p class="indent">
Example.
<br />
The present King of France is not bald.
</p>

<p>
There are two options for representing this sentence.</p> 

\[
[(\atoi x)(Kx)] \sdot  \osim B(\atoi x)(Kx)
\]

<p>
and</p> 

\[
\osim [(\atoi x)(Kx)] \sdot  B(\atoi x)(Kx)
\]

<p>
In the first, the description has &ldquo;wide&rdquo; scope, and in the
second, the description has &ldquo;narrow&rdquo; scope. Russell says
that the description has &ldquo;primary occurrence&rdquo; in the
former, and &ldquo;secondary occurrence&rdquo; in the latter. Given
the definition &lowast;14&middot;01, the two PM formulas immediately above
become expanded into primitive notation as:</p> 

\[
\begin{align}
(\exists b) \colon PKFx \equiv_x x=b \colon \osim Bb\\
\osim (\exists b) \colon PKFx \equiv_x x=b \colon Bb
\end{align}
\]

<p>
In modern notation these become:</p> 

\[
\begin{align}
\exists x[\forall y(PKFy \equiv y=x) \amp \osim Bx]\\
\osim \exists x[\forall y(PKFy \equiv y=x) \amp Bx]
\end{align}
\]

<p>
The former says that there is one and only one object which is a
present King of France and which is not bald; i.e., there is exactly
one present King of France and he is not bald. This reading is false,
given that there is no present King of France. The latter says it is
not the case that there is exactly one present King of France which is
bald. This reading is true. </p>

<p>
Although Whitehead and Russell take the descriptions in these examples
to be the expressions which have scope, the above readings in both
expanded PM notation and in modern notation suggest why some modern
logicians take the difference in readings here to be a matter of the
scope of the negation sign. </p>

<h2 id="Clas">9. Classes</h2>

<p>
The circumflex &ldquo;&circ;&rdquo; over a variable preceding a
formula is used to indicate a class, thus \(\hat{x} \psi x\) is the
class of things \(x\) which are such that \(\psi x\). In modern
notation we represent this class as \(\{x \mid \psi x\}\), which is
read: the class of \(x\) which are such that \(x\) has \(\psi\).
Recall that &ldquo;\(\phi \hat{x}\)&rdquo;, with the circumflex over a
variable after the predicate variable, expresses the propositional
function of being an \(x\) such that \(\phi x\). In the type theory of
PM, the class \(\hat{x} \phi x\) has the same logical type as the
function \(\phi \hat{x}\). This makes it appropriate to use the
following contextual definition, which allows one to eliminate the
class term \(\hat{x} \psi x\) from occurrences in the context \(f\):

\[
\tag*{&lowast;20&middot;01} 
 f\{ \hat{z}(\psi z)\} \ldot {=} \colon (\exists \phi) \colon \phi \bang x \ldot  {\equiv_x} \ldot  \psi x \colon f \{ \phi\bang \hat{z}\}  \quad\Df
\]

 or in modern notation: 

\[
f\{z \mid \psi z\} =_{df} \exists \phi[\forall x(\phi x \equiv \psi x) \amp f(\lambda x \phi x)]
\]

 where \(\phi\) is a
predicative function of \(x\)</p>

<p>
Note that \(f\) has to be interpreted as a higher-order function which
is predicated of the function \(\phi \bang \hat{z}\). In the modern
notation used above, the language has to be a typed language in which
\(\lambda\) expressions are allowed in argument position. As was
pointed out later (Chwistek 1924, G&ouml;del 1944, and Carnap 1947)
there should be scope indicators for class expressions just as there
are for definite descriptions. Chwistek, for example, proposed copying
the notation for definite descriptions, thus replacing &lowast;20&middot;01
with:</p> 

\[
[\hat{z}(\psi z)] \sdot  f\{ \hat{z}(\psi z)\} \ldot {=} \colon (\exists \phi) \colon \phi \bang x \ldot {\equiv_x} \ldot  \psi x \colon f \{ \phi\bang \hat{z} \}
\]

<p>
Contemporary formalizations of set theory make use of something like
these contextual definitions, when they require an
&ldquo;existence&rdquo; theorem of the form \(\exists x\forall y(y \in
x \equiv \ldots y\ldots)\), in order to justify the introduction of a
singular term \(\{y \mid \ldots y\ldots \}\). (Given the law of
extensionality, it follows from \(\exists x\forall y(y \in x \equiv
\ldots y\ldots)\) that there is a unique such set.) The relation of
membership in classes \(\in\) is defined in PM by first defining a
similar relationship between objects and propositional functions:

\[
\tag*{&lowast;20&middot;02}
x \in (\phi\bang \hat{z})  \ldot {=} \ldot  \phi \bang x \quad\Df 
\]

 or, in modern notation: 

\[
x \in \lambda z\phi z =_{df} \phi x
\]

 </p>

<p>
&lowast;20&middot;01 and &lowast;20&middot;02 together are then used to define the
more familiar notion of membership in a class. The formal expression
&ldquo;\(y \in \{ \hat{z}(\phi z)\}\)&rdquo; can now been seen as a
context in which the class term occurs; it is then eliminated by the
contextual definition &lowast;20&middot;01. (Exercise)</p>

<p>
PM also has Greek letters for classes: \(\alpha, \beta, \gamma\), etc.
These will appear as bound (real) variables, apparent (free) variables
and in abstracts for propositional functions true of classes, as in
\(\phi \hat{\alpha}\). Only definitions of the bound Greek variables
appear in the body of the text, the others are informally defined in
the <em>Introduction</em>: 

\[
\tag*{&lowast;20&middot;07}  
(\alpha) \sdot f \alpha \ldot {=} \ldot  (\phi) \sdot  f \{ \hat{z}(\phi\bang z)\} \quad\Df
\]

 or, in modern notation,

\[
\forall \alpha\, f\alpha =_{df} \forall \phi f\{z\mid\phi z\}
\]

 where \(\phi\) is a predicative function. </p>

<p>
Thus universally quantified class variables are defined in terms of
quantifiers ranging over predicative functions. Likewise for
existential quantification: 

\[
\tag*{&lowast;20&middot;071} 
 (\exists \alpha) \sdot f \alpha \ldot {=} \ldot  (\exists \phi) \sdot  f \{ \hat{z}(\phi\bang z)\} \quad\Df
\]

 or, in modern notation,

\[
\exists \alpha\, f\alpha =_{df} \exists \phi f\{z\mid\phi z\}
\]

 where \(\phi\) is a predicative function. </p>

<p>
Expressions with a Greek variable to the left of \(\in\) are defined:

\[
\tag*{&lowast;20&middot;081}
\alpha \in \psi\bang \hat{\alpha} \ldot {=} \ldot  \psi \bang \alpha  \quad\Df
\]

 </p>

<p>
These definitions do not cover all possible occurrences of Greek
variables. In the Introduction to PM, further definitions of are \(f
\alpha\) and \(f \hat{\alpha}\) proposed, but it is remarked that the
definitions are in some way peculiar and they do not appear in the
body of the work. The definition considered for \(f \hat{\alpha}\)
is:</p> 

\[
f \hat{\alpha} \ldot {=} \ldot  (\exists \psi) \sdot  \hat{\phi} \bang x \equiv_x \psi \bang x \sdot  f \{ \psi\bang \hat{z} \}
\]

<p>
or, in modern notation,</p> 

\[
\lambda \alpha\, f\alpha =_{df} \lambda \phi f\{x \mid \phi x\}
\]

<p>
That is, \(f \hat{\alpha}\) is an expression naming the function which
takes a function \(\phi\) to a proposition which asserts \(f\) of the
class of \(\phi\)s. (The modern notation shows that in the proposed
definition of \(f \hat{\alpha}\) in PM notation, we shouldn&rsquo;t
expect \(\alpha\) in the definiens, since it is really a bound
variable in \(f \hat{\alpha}\); similarly, we shouldn&rsquo;t expect
\(\phi\) in the definiendum because it is a bound variable in the
definiens.) One might also expect definitions like &lowast;20&middot;07 and
&lowast;20&middot;071 to hold for cases in which the Roman letter
&ldquo;\(z\)&rdquo; is replaced by a Greek letter. The definitions in
PM are thus not complete, but it is possible to guess at how they
would be extended to cover all occurrences of Greek letters. This
would complete the project of the &ldquo;no-classes&rdquo; theory of
classes by showing how all talk of classes can be reduced to the
theory of propositional functions.</p>

<h2 id="ProToCarAri">10. Prolegomena to Cardinal Arithmetic</h2>

<p>
Although students of philosophy usually read no further than &lowast;20 in
PM, this is in fact the point where the &ldquo;construction&rdquo; of
mathematics really begins. &lowast;21 presents the &ldquo;General Theory of
Relations&rdquo; (the theory of relations in extension; in
contemporary logic these are treated as sets of ordered pairs,
following Wiener). \(\hat{x} \hat{y} \psi(x, y)\) is the relation
between \(x\) and \(y\) which obtains when \(\psi(x, y)\) is true. In
modern notation we represent this as as the set of ordered pairs
\(\{\langle x, y \rangle \mid \psi( x, y ) \}\), which is read: the
set of ordered pairs \(\langle x, y \rangle\) which are such that
\(x\) bears the relation \(\psi\) to \(y\). </p>

<p>
The following contextual definition (&lowast;21&middot;01) allows one
to eliminate the relation term \(\hat{x} \hat{y}\psi (x, y)\) from
occurrences in the context \(f\): </p>

\[
  f \{ \hat{x} \hat{y} \psi ( x, y )\} \ldot {=} \colondot
(\exists \phi) \colon \phi \bang  ( x, y ) \ldot {\equiv_{x,y}} \ldot \psi( x, x ) \colon f \{ \phi\bang  (\hat{u}, \hat{v} )\} 
\quad\Df
\]

<p>
or in modern notation: </p> 

\[
f \{\langle x, y  \rangle \mid \psi( x, y )\} =_{df} \exists \phi[\forall xy (\phi(x, y) \equiv \psi( x, y) ) \amp
f ( \lambda u \lambda v \phi(u,v))]
\]

<p>
where \(\phi\) is a predicative function of \(u\) and \(v\).</p>

<p>
<em>Principia</em> does not analyze relations (or mathematical
functions) in terms of sets of ordered pairs, but rather takes the
notion of propositional function as primitive and defines relations
and functions in terms of them. The upper case letters \({R}, {S}\)
and \({T}\), etc., are used after &lowast;21 to stand for these
&ldquo;relations in extension&rdquo;, and are distinguished from
propositional functions by being written between the arguments. Thus
it is \(\psi(x,y)\) with arguments after the propositional function
symbol, but \(xRy\). From &lowast;21 functions &ldquo;\(\phi\) and
\(\psi\)&rdquo;, etc., disappear and only relations in extension,
\({R}\), \({S}\) and \({T}\), etc., appear in the pages of <em>
Principia </em>. While propositional functions might be true of the
same objects yet not be identical, no two relations in extension are
true of the same objects. The logic of <em>Principia</em> is thus
&ldquo;extensional&rdquo;, from page 200 in volume I, through to the
end in Volume III. </p>

<p>
&lowast;22 on the &ldquo;Calculus of Classes&rdquo; presents the elementary
set theory of intersections, unions and the empty set which is often
all the set theory used in elementary mathematics of other sorts. The
student looking for the set theory of <em>Principia</em> to compare it
with, say the Zermelo-Fraenkel system, will have to look at various
numbers later in the text. The Axiom of Choice is defined at &lowast;88 as
the &ldquo;Multiplicative Axiom&rdquo; and a version of the Axiom of
Infinity appears at &lowast;120 in Volume II as &ldquo;Infin ax&rdquo;. The
set theory of <em>Principia</em> comes closest to Zermelo&rsquo;s
axioms of 1908 among the various familiar axiom systems, which means
that it lacks the Axiom of Foundation and Axiom of Replacement of the
now standard Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory. 
The system of <em>Principia</em> differs importantly from
Zermelo&rsquo;s in that it is formulated in the simple theory of
types. As a result, for example, there are no quantifiers ranging over
all sets, and there is a set of all things (for each type).
</p>

<p>
&lowast;30 on &ldquo;Descriptive Functions&rdquo; provides Whitehead and
Russell&rsquo;s analysis of mathematical functions in terms of
relations and definite descriptions. Frege had used the notion of
function, in the mathematical sense, as a basic notion in his logical
system. Thus a Fregean &ldquo;concept&rdquo; is a function from
objects as arguments to one of the two &ldquo;truth values&rdquo; as
its values. A concept yields the value &ldquo;True&rdquo; for each
object to which the concept applies, and &ldquo;False&rdquo; for all
others. Russell, from 1904, well before the writing of
<em>Principia</em> had preferred to analyze functions in terms of the
relation between each argument and value, and the notion of
&ldquo;uniqueness&rdquo;. With modern symbolism, his view would be
expressed as follows. For each function \(\lambda x f(x)\), there will
be some relation (in extension) \(R\), such that the value of the
function for an argument \(a\), that is \(f(a)\), will be the unique
individual which bears the relation \(R\) to \(a\). (Nowadays we
reduce functions to a binary relation between the argument in the
first place and value in the second place.) The result is that there
are no function symbols in <em>Principia</em>. As Whitehead and
Russell say, the familiar mathematical expressions such as
&ldquo;\(\sin \pi/2\)&rdquo; will be analyzed with a relation and a
definite description, as a &ldquo;descriptive function&rdquo;. The
&ldquo;descriptive function&rdquo;, \(R&lsquo;y\) (the \(R\) of
\(y)\), is defined as follows: </p> 

\[
\tag*{&lowast;30&middot;01}  
R&lsquo;y = (\atoi x)xRy \quad\Df
\]

<p>
We conclude this section by presenting a number of prominent examples
from these later numbers below, with their intuitive meaning, location
in PM, definition in PM, and a modern equivalent. (Some of these
numbers are theorems rather than definitions.) Note, however, that the
modern equivalent will sometimes logically differ from the original
version in PM, such as by treating relations as sets of ordered pairs,
etc. In his account of the logic of <em>Principia</em>, W.V. Quine
(1951) objects to the complexity and even redundancy of much of this
symbolism. These formulas can be worked out, however, with a step by
step application of the definitions.

<h2>11. Arithmetic in Volume II</h2>


<p>Volume II of <em>Principia Mathematica</em> begins with Part III,
&ldquo;Cardinal Arithmetic&rdquo;. The notions of cardinal numbers are
developed in full generality, extending to infinite
cardinals. Consequently the theory of natural numbers, which are
called &ldquo;Inductive Cardinals&rdquo; in PM, is introduced with a
series of definitions of special cases of notions that are first
introduced in a general form applying to any numbers or classes. For
example, addition of natural numbers, as in the famous proof that 1 +
1 = 2 in &lowast;110&middot;04 is proved with for the special
case of the addition of classes that applies to cardinal numbers,
&lsquo;\(+_c\)&rsquo;. These definitions, concluding with the
appearance of the Axiom of Infinity at &lowast;120&middot;03
will conclude this introduction to the symbolism of <em>Principia
Mathematica</em>.</p>

Cardinal addition is the arithmetical sum of &ldquo;homogeneous

The reader can now appreciate why this elementary theorem is not proved until page 83 of Volume II of <em>PM</em>:<br />
\[\tag*{&lowast;110&middot;643} 
  1 +_c 1 = 2
\]

<p>
Whitehead and Russell remark that &ldquo;The above proposition is
occasionally useful. It is used at least three times, in
&hellip;&rdquo;. This joke reminds us that the theory of natural
numbers, so central to Frege&rsquo;s works, appears in PM as only a
special case of a general theory of cardinal and ordinal numbers and
even more general classes of isomorphic structures.</p>

<p>
This survey of the notation in PM concludes with the definition of the
natural numbers and a statement of the Axiom of Infinity, which allow
the proof of the other axioms of Peano Arithmetic as, again, special
cases of more general notions.</p>

The Axiom of Infinity asserts that all inductive cardinals are
non-empty. (Recall that 0 = \(\{ \varnothing \}\), and so 0 is not
empty.) The Axiom of Infinity is not a &ldquo;primitive
proposition&rdquo; but instead to be listed as an
&ldquo;hypothesis&rdquo; where used, that is as the antecedent of a
conditional, where the consequent will be said to depend on the
axiom. Technically it is not an <em>axiom</em> of PM as
[&lowast;120&middot;03] is a <em>definition</em>, so this is just
further notation in PM!</span>

<h2>12. Conclusion</h2>

<p>The definitions up to &lowast;120&middot;03 constitute only about
half of the definitions in PM. The last eight pages (667&ndash;674) of
Volume I of the second edition (1925) consists of a complete
&ldquo;List of Definitions&rdquo; from all three
volumes. Correspondence in the Bertrand Russell Archives suggests that
this list may have been compiled by Dorothy Wrinch. The list can be
used to trace every one of the defined expressions of PM back to the
notation discussed in this entry.</p>
