 Russell’s “No-Class” theory of classes from *20 of Principia Mathematica provides a contextual definition like that of the theory of definite descriptions. One of Russell’s early diagnoses of the paradox of the class of all classes that are not members of themselves was that it showed that classes could not be individuals. Indeed Russell seems to have come across his paradox by applying Cantor’s famous diagonal argument to show that there are more classes of individuals than individuals. Hence, he concluded, classes could not be individuals, and expressions for classes such as ‘\(\{x: Fx \}\)’ cannot be the singular terms they appear to be. Inspired by the theory of descriptions, Russell proposed that to say something \(G\) of the class of \(F\)s, \(G\) \(\{x: Fx \}\), is to say that there is some (predicative) property \(H\) coextensive with (true of the same things as) \(F\) such that \(H\) is \(G\). The restriction to predicative properties, or those which are not defined in terms of quantification over other properties, was a consequence of the ramification of the theory of types to avoid intensional or “epistemic” paradoxes which motivated the theory of types in addition to the set theoretical “Russell’s Paradox” (see Whitehead and Russell 1910–13, Introduction, Chapter II). These predicative properties are intensional, however, in the sense that two distinct properties might hold of the same objects. (See the entry on the  notation in Principia Mathematica.)  That classes so defined have the feature of extensionality is thus derivable, rather than postulated. If \(F\) and \(H\) are coextensive then anything true of \(\{x:Fx \}\) will be true of \(\{x:Hx \}\). Features of classes then follow from the features of the logic of properties. Because classes would at first seem to be individuals of some sort, but on analysis are found not to be, Russell speaks of them as “logical fictions,” an expression which echoes Jeremy Bentham’s notion of “legal fictions.” (Hart 1994, 84) (See entry on  law and language).  That a corporation is a “person” at law was for Bentham merely a fiction that could be cashed out in terms of the notion of legal standing and of limits to the financial liability of real persons. Thus any language about such “legal fictions” could be translated in other terms to be about real individuals and their legal relationships. Because statements attributing a property to particular classes are replaced by existential sentences saying that there is some propositional function having that property, this construction also can be characterized as showing that class expressions, such as ‘\(\{x:Fx \}\)’, are incomplete symbols. They are not replaced by some longer formula expressing a term. On the other hand, the definition should not be seen as avoiding ontological commitment entirely, as showing that something is literally a “fiction”. Rather it shows how to reduce classes to propositional functions. The properties of classes are really properties of propositional functions and for every class said to have a property there really is some propositional function having that property.
