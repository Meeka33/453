 Bolzano began his mathematical investigations with a work in geometry (Bolzano 1804) and continued with publications in the area of analysis. He essentially formulated the modern criterion of convergence in his Purely Analytic Proof (Bolzano 1817, 11 f.) already four years prior to Cauchy’s Course d’analyse (1821). This work already contains the so-called Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, which again occurs in Bolzano’s posthumously edited Theory of Functions (Bolzano 1930, 28 f., BGA IIA, 10/1: 47 f.). Here (Bolzano 1930, 66–70, 98 f., BGA IIA, 10/1: 79–82, 103) we find also for the first time an example of a continuous and still non-differentiable function; for a long time, Weierstrass had been regarded as the first one who discovered such functions, until historical justice was done by Karel Rychlík’s investigations. In his Paradoxes of the Infinite (Bolzano 1851) and in the Theory of Quantity Bolzano took the first steps towards the development of set theory and anticipated many of its important ideas. In this connection mention is especially often made of Bolzano’s grasp of the “paradoxical” fact that an infinite set can and must be equipollent with one of its proper subsets, i.e., is “reflexive”. This special feature of infinite sets was later used for their definition by Dedekind. For Bolzano, equipollence and “having exactly the same kind of construction” (die ganz gleiche Entstehungsart haben) are taken together as a sufficient condition for infinite sets being equinumerous or having the same cardinal number. This view, however, contradicts the unrestricted application of the classical Euclidean principle that the whole is greater than each of its parts. Bolzano was aware of this conflict and therefore restricted the principle to finite sets. From here the step is not far to Dedekind’s view that equipollence is a sufficient condition for equinumerosity. Bolzano’s proof for the existence of an infinite set is well known among mathematicians, and there are references to it even in Cantor 1883/84, Dedekind 1888, and Russell 1903. Bolzano proves by mathematical induction that there are infinitely many “truths in themselves”, i.e., true propositions. For the induction basis, i.e., that there is at least one true proposition, he uses an indirect proof (as shown already in section 3.3). Bolzano’s induction hypothesis is the assumption that there are at least \(n\) true propositions which we can enumerate as \(S_1, S_2 ,\ldots ,S_n\). Bolzano proves that there must be at least \(n+1\) true propositions by reductio again: If there were not at least \(n+1\) true propositions, i.e., if there were at most \(n\) true propositions, then — according to the induction hypothesis — \(S_1, S_2 ,\ldots ,S_n\) would be the only true propositions; but then there would be another true proposition \(S_{n+1}\), viz. [\(S_1, S_2,\ldots\) and \(S_n\) are the only true propositions], and \(S_1, S_2 ,\ldots ,S_n\) would therefore not be the only true propositions (WL I, 146 f.). Bolzano proposes also a second way for proving this by constructing a series of true propositions in which we add to any true proposition \(S_n\) another true proposition [\(S_n\) is true] that is (due to Bolzano’s criterion for the identity of propositions) different from \(S_n\). Given any true proposition \(S\) whose existence is proved by the induction basis, this will result in an infinite series of true propositions of the following kind: \(S\), [\(S\) is true], [[\(S\) is true] is true] etc. (WL I, 147, Bolzano 1851, § 13). In constructing this series, Bolzano uses a relation \(T\) that can be defined as follows: \(Txy \text{ iff } y = [x \text{ is true}].\) ‘\(Txy\)’ is here an abbreviation for: \(y\) is the proposition that the proposition \(x\) is true. The relation \(T\) has the following properties: The statement that a relation with the properties (1)–(4) exists is Alonzo Church’s infinity axiom \(\infty 3\) (in Introduction to Mathematical Logic, Vol. I, 1956, 343). All these interesting achievements of Bolzano regarding details nonetheless seem insignificant in view of his epochal attempt, which he unfortunately could not complete, to put all of mathematics on new foundations. The fact alone that Bolzano sensed the necessity of such a new grounding of mathematics shows his mathematical instinct, although this program could only much later be realized.
