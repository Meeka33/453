 It should be evident that the idea of narrow content is highly controversial. Many thinkers reject the very idea of narrow content, while to many others it seems an attractive way to think about the kind or aspect of mental content that most closely captures the subject's perspective on the world, the nature of rational belief and inference, and the nature and extent of a priori knowledge. Even among its advocates, however, there is substantial disagreement on the precise form a theory of narrow content should take. There is much work left to be done on this topic: to develop the various approaches more fully; to determine to what extent they are compatible with one another; and, to the extent that they are not, to compare their advantages and disadvantages.
