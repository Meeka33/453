 The strongest and most widespread proposal for finding a narrower criterion for logical consequence is the appeal to formality. The step in (4) from “Peter is Greg’s mother’s brother’s son” to “Peter is my cousin” is a material consequence and not a formal one, because to make the step from the premise to the conclusion we need more than the structure or form of the claims involved: we need to understand their contents too. What could the distinction between form and content mean? We mean to say that consequence is formal if it depends on the form and not the substance of the claims involved. But how is that to be understood? We will give at most a sketch, which, again, can be filled out in a number of ways. The obvious first step is to notice that all presentations of the rules of logical consequence rely on  schemes.  Aristotle’s syllogistic is a proud example. Ferio: No \(F\) is \(G\). Some \(H\) is \(G\). Therefore some \(H\) is not \(F\). Inference schemes, like the one above, display the structure of valid arguments. Perhaps to say that an argument is formally valid is to say that it falls under some general scheme of which every instance is valid, such as Ferio. That, too, is an incomplete specification of formality. The material argument (4) is an instance of: every instance of which is valid. We must say more to explain why some schemes count as properly formal (and hence a sufficient ground for logical consequence) and others do not. A general answer will articulate the notion of  logical form,  which is an important issue in its own right (involving the notion of  logical constants,  among other things). Instead of exploring the details of different candidates for logical form, we will mention different proposals about the point of the exercise. What is the point in demanding that validity be underwritten by a notion of logical form? There are at least three distinct proposals for the required notion of formality, and each provides a different kind of answer to that question. We might take the formal rules of logic to be totally neutral with respect to particular features of objects. Laws of logic, on this view, must abstract away from particular features of objects. Logic is formal in that it is totally general. One way to characterise what counts as a totally general notion is by way of permutations. Tarski proposed (1986) that an operation or predicate on a domain counted as general (or logical) if it was invariant under permutations of objects. (A permutation of a collection of objects assigns for each object a unique object in that collection, such that no object is assigned more than once. A permutation of \(\{a, b, c, d\}\) might, for example, assign \(b\) to \(a, d\) to \(b, c\) to \(c\) and \(a\) to \(d\).) A \(2\)-place predicate \(R\) is invariant under permutation if for any permutation \(p\), whenever \(Rxy\) holds, \(Rp(x)p(y)\) holds too. You can see that the identity relation is permutation invariant—if \(x = y\) then \(p(x) = p(y)\)—but the mother-of relation is not. We may have permutations \(p\) such that even though \(x\) is the mother of \(y\), \(p(x)\) is not the mother of \(p(y)\). We may use permutation to characterise logicality for more than predicates too: we may say that a one-place sentential connective ‘\(\bullet\)’ is permutation invariant if and only if, for all \(A\), \(p(\bullet A)\) is true if and only if \(\bullet p(A)\) is true. Defining this rigorously requires establishing how permutations operate on sentences, and this takes us beyond the scope of this article. Suffice to say, an operation such as negation passes the test of invariance, but an operation such as ‘JC believes that’ fails. A closely related analysis for formality is that formal rules are totally abstract. They abstract away from the semantic content of thoughts or claims, to leave only semantic structure. The terms ‘mother’ and ‘cousin’ enter essentially into argument (5). On this view, expressions such as propositional connectives and quantifiers do not add new semantic content to expressions, but instead add only ways to combine and structure semantic content. Expressions like ‘mother’ and ‘cousin’, by contrast, add new semantic content. Another way to draw the distinction (or to perhaps to draw a different distinction) is to take the formal rules of logic to be constitutitive norms for thought, regardless of its subject matter. It is plausible to hold that no matter what we think about, it makes sense to conjoin, disjoin and negate our thoughts to make new thoughts. It might also make sense to quantify. The behaviour, then, of logical vocabulary may be used to structure and regulate any kind of theory, and the norms governing logical vocabulary apply totally universally. The norms of valid argument, on this picture, are those norms that apply to thought irrespective of the particular content of that  thought.[1]
