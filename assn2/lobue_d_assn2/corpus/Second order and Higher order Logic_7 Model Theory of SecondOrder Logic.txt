 Let us start by noting that there are some trivial consequences of second-order logic being able to quantify over relations. For example, the Craig Interpolation Theorem holds for second-order logic for trivial reasons: If the finite relational vocabulary of \(\phi\) is L, the finite relational vocabulary of \(\phi'\) is \(L'\) and \(\models\phi\to\phi',\) then there is \(\theta\) such that \(\models\phi\to\theta\text{ and } \models\theta\to\phi'\) and the vocabulary of \(\theta\) is \(L\cap L'\), because we can let \(\theta\) be the sentence \(\exists X_1\ldots\exists X_n\,\phi\), where \(L\setminus L'=\{X_1,\ldots, X_n\}\). We can additionally demand that every predicate symbol occurring positively in \(\theta\) occurs positively in \(\phi\) and \(\psi\), and every predicate symbol occurring negatively in \(\theta\) occurs negatively in \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) (the Lyndon Interpolation Theorem [Lyndon 1959]). In the same way the Beth Definability Theorem holds for trivial reasons, also some preservation  results[7]  have a trivial proof. For a negative result, see Craig 1965. However, second-order logic does not have a model theory in the same sense as first order logic does. There is no Compactness Theorem to produce non-standard models. One reason why first order logic has such a rich model theory is that first order logic is relatively weak. Countable first order theories that have infinite models have models of all infinite cardinalities. This is a consequence of a weakness of first order logic: its sentences cannot limit the size of the model unless the size is finite. In model theory this weakness is turned to a strength: the structure of models of first order theories can be analyzed in interesting ways. See the entry on  model theory  for examples of this. Second-order theories can typically have just one model up to isomorphism. Thus if we investigate the class of models of a second-order sentence, the class may very well consist of just one model, up to isomorphism. With just one model one cannot really develop a model theory. One ends up investigating the one and only model and there are no compelling reasons to use logic in the study of it. If the one and only model is an algebraic structure, one should use algebra to study it. If it is an ordered structure, one should use the general theory of ordered structures to study it, and so on. It is unlikely that being second-order characterizable (see  §7.1)  tells much about the structure. It reveals more about second-order logic in general. For example, being able to characterize the structure of natural numbers means that the Compactness Theorem and the Completeness Theorem fail. Being able to characterize the ordered field of real numbers means that both the Downward and the Upward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorems fail. It is from this perspective—to understand second-order logic itself—that it is interesting to know exactly which structures are second-order characterizable up to isomorphism. Let us finally compare the two hierarchies, the model theoretic hierarchy \(\Sigma_n^1\cup\Pi_n^1\) inside second-order logic and the Levy hierarchy \(\Sigma_n\cup\Pi_n\) in set theory. Theorem 4 In the light of the above theorem second-order logic sits firmly on the \(\Sigma_2\cup\Pi_2\)-level of set theoretic definability. This is a reason to consider second-order logic weaker than first order set theory. This sounds paradoxical. How can second-order logic, with all the power and non-first order properties it has, be weaker than first order logic based set theory, when first order logic cannot even express finiteness, countability, uncountability, and so on? Nevertheless the message of  Theorem 4  is undeniable. Perhaps this would not be so puzzling if we thought of set theory as a very high order logic over the singleton of the empty set. After all, set theory permits endless iterations of the power set operation, while second-order logic permits only one iteration. We start below with a subsection on models that can be characterized in second-order logic by one sentence up to isomorphism. Another approach to the model theory of second-order logic is to focus on models with large cardinal (inaccessible, measurable, supercompact cardinals) properties. This is the topic of  §7.2.  Finally, in  §7.3  we consider the possibility of allowing the so-called general models introduced in  §9.1.  In this case second-order logic becomes very much like first order logic. However, general models are mostly interesting when they are so-called Henkin models, i.e., they satisfy the so-called Comprehension Axioms. In Henkin models second-order logic satisfies the Compactness Theorem and other principles familiar from first order model theory but no general structure- or classification theory exists yet, perhaps because the Comprehension Axioms bring in a lot of complicated structure into the models. A structure \(\ma\) is second-order characterizable if there is a second-order sentence \(\theta_\ma\) such that \(\mb\models\theta_\ma\iff\mb\cong\ma\) for all structures \(\mb\) of the same vocabulary as \(\ma\). Example 5: The following structures are second-order characterizable: Are all structures second-order characterizable? There are only countably many second-order sentences, hence only countably many (up to isomorphism) second-order characterizable structures. Therefore there are lots of structures of every infinite cardinality which are not second-order characterizable. However, it is not easy to give examples. One example is \((\kappa,<)\), where \(\kappa\) is the first measurable cardinal (\(>\omega\)). See  §7.2  for an explanation. Another example is \((\oN,<,A)\), where A is the set of Gödel numbers of valid second-order sentences in the vocabulary of one binary relation. For an explanation, see  §7.2.  One may ask whether there is an example which arises from mathematical practice outside of mathematical logic. What about \((\oR,+,\times,<,A)\), where A is a Hamel basis (a basis for the vector space where the reals are the vectors, rationals are the scalars and vector addition is the usual addition of reals)? It is consistent, relative to the consistency of ZF that no such structure \((\oR,+,\times,<,A)\) is second-order characterizable (Hyttinen, Kangas, & Väänänen 2013). A special property of second-order characterizable structures is that their reducts are also second-order characterizable, because we can use existential second-order quantifiers to “guess” the missing relations and functions. Therefore it is interesting to find characterizable structures that have as many (but only finitely many) relations and functions as possible. We can endow \(\oN\) with any finite number of recursive functions \(f_1,\ldots, f_n \) and relations \(R_1,\ldots, R_m\) obtaining the structure \((\oN,f_1,\ldots, f_n,R_1,\ldots, R_m)\) and this is second-order characterizable. We can endow \(\oR\) with any familiar analytic functions such as trigonometric functions or any other functions given by a convergent power series the coefficients of which are given by a recursive function, and the result is second-order characterizable. It is easy to see that the second-order theory of a second-order characterizable structure \(\ma\) is Turing-reducible to the second-order theory of any bigger second-order characterizable structure \(\mb\), as for all second-order \(\phi\): The bigger the characterizable structure is, the more complex is the second-order theory. That there is no largest characterizable structure can be seen as follows: If \(\ma\) is second-order characterizable, then so is the reduct of \(\ma\) to the empty  vocabulary[8],  that is, the cardinality \(|A|\) of \(\ma\) is characterizable. Such cardinal numbers were studied by Garland (1974). For example, if \(\kappa\) is characterizable, then so are \(\kappa^+\) and \(2^\kappa\). If \(\phi\) is a second-order sentence, we define If \(\phi\) characterizes a model \(\ma\), then \(\Mod(\phi)\) is just the class of models isomorphic to \(\ma\). If we look at \(\Mod(\phi)\) from the perspective of set theory, we know it is \(\Delta_2\)  (Theorem 4).  On the other hand, the set of Gödel numbers of valid second-order sentences is \(\Pi_2\)-complete  (Theorem 4),  hence not \(\Sigma_2\) and in particular, not \(\Delta_2\). This contemplation leads us to the following extension of  Theorem 3  above: Theorem 6 (Väänänen 2012) Second-order validity is not second-order definable on any second-order characterizable structure. This raises the question, how can we understand second-order validity from the second-order perspective? In view of the above theorem we cannot understand second-order validity as something that can be expressed in second-order logic on some structure which itself can be characterized in second-order logic. The reference to set theory seems inevitable in understanding second-order validity. Let us discuss what this might mean from the point of view of structuralism. Parsons defines structuralism as follows: By the “structuralist view” of mathematical objects, I mean the view that reference to mathematical objects is always in the context of some background structure, and that the objects involved have no more to them than can be expressed in terms of the basic relations of the structure. (Parsons 1990: 303) Structuralism in this sense (for other kinds of structuralism, see, e.g., Hellman 2001) seems to fit well into the second-order logic framework. Contrary to set theory, second-order logic always assumes an underlying (limited) structure which is supposed to reflect one particular aspect of mathematics such as the semi-ring of natural numbers, the ordered field of real numbers, the field of complex numbers, the well-ordered structure \((\omega_1,<)\), and so on. Ideally, these underlying structures are second-order characterizable. This leads to a problem with universal truths such as validity, but also with less complex ones such as the statement that every linear order has a completion, or that every field has an algebraic closure. Such universal truths are not about any particular structure. We refer to the SEP entries  independence and large cardinals  and  large cardinals and determinacy  for the definition of concepts related to large cardinals. The following early result on the connection between model theory of second-order logic and large cardinals is a model for other more delicate results. It is a kind of Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem for second-order logic. It says that if a second-order sentence has a model of the cardinality of a measurable cardinal, then it has a smaller submodel: Theorem 7 (Scott 1961) Suppose \(\kappa\) is a measurable cardinal. If \(\phi\) is a second-order sentence and \(\phi\) has a model \(\mm\) of cardinality \(\kappa\), then for every \(X\subseteq M\) of cardinality \(<\kappa\) there is \(\mn\subseteq\mm\) such that \(X\subseteq N\) and \(\mn\models\phi\).  [9] A particular consequence is that the first measurable cardinal cannot be second-order characterizable as a model of the empty vocabulary (a fact that was referred to above in  §7.1).  Theorem 7 resembles remarkably the Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem of first order logic. The only difference is that one has to start with a big model, a model of the size of a measurable cardinal. Smaller cardinals need not work. For example, if \(\lambda\) is the least weakly compact cardinal \(>\omega\), then there is a sentence \(\phi\) which has \(\lambda\) (with the empty vocabulary) as a model but no smaller models. The  sentence[10]  \(\phi\) says that \(\lambda\) is inaccessible (\(>\omega\)) and that every \(\lambda\)-tree (a tree of height \(\lambda\) with all levels of size \(<\lambda\)) has a branch of length \(\lambda\). If we want to obtain a Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem which works for any structure, not only for structures of a measurable cardinality, we have to look at even bigger cardinals: The LST-number of second-order logic is defined to be the least (if any exist) \(\kappa\) such that if \(\ma\) is any structure and \(\phi\) is a second-order sentence true in \(\ma\), then there is a substructure \(\mb\) of \(\ma\) which also satisfies \(\phi.\) Theorem 8 (Magidor 1971) The LST-number of second-order logic exists if and only if there are supercompact cardinals \(>\omega\) and then it is the smallest of them. Second-order logic is said to satisfy strong \(\kappa\)-compactness if every second-order theory, every subset of size \(<\kappa\) of which has a model, has itself a model. Theorem 9 (Magidor 1971) The least \(\kappa\) such that second-order logic satisfies the strong \(\kappa\)-compactness is the least extendible cardinal. The situation changes completely if we adopt so-called general models  (§9.1).  With general models second-order logic has similar model theoretic properties as first order logic, as it can simply be thought of as many sorted first order logic (see  §9.1  and Manzano 1996). By and large, results of many-sorted first order logic translate immediately to second-order logic.
