 We have up to now treated set theory (ZFC) as a first order theory. However, when Zermelo (1930) introduced the axioms which constitute the modern ZFC axiom system, he formulated the axioms in second-order logic. In particular, his Separation Axiom is and the Replacement Axiom is Second-order ZFC, \(\ZFC^2\), is simply the received first order ZFC with the Separation Schema replaced by the above single Separation Axiom, and the Replacement Schema replaced by the above single Replacement Axiom. Accordingly, \(\ZFC^2\) is a finite axiom system. Zermelo proved that the models of \(\ZFC^2\) are, up to isomorphism, of the form \((V_\kappa,\in)\), where \(\kappa\) is (strongly) inaccessible \(>\omega\). Kreisel (1967) has pointed out that second-order set theory in a sense decides the CH, i.e., decides whether it is true or not, even if we do not know which way the decision goes. More exactly \(\ZFC^2\models CH\) or \(\ZFC^2\models \neg CH\), because \(CH\) is true if and only if \(V_\kappa\models CH\) for inaccessible \(\kappa\), i.e., if and only if \(\ZFC^2\models CH\). Of course we can express CH in first order set theory, too, so the situation is not really different from first order set theory. Many set theorists think that the concept of set is definitive enough to decide eventually also CH even if ZFC does not decide it. Likewise, we may argue that the concept of second-order semantics is definitive enough to decide CH even if the current axioms of second-order logic cannot do it. The question arises, why do we not use second-order set theory \(\ZFC^2\) as the metatheory of second-order logic, as recommended in Shapiro (1991). In fact we could use it. However, the question might rise, what is the semantics of our metatheory? In principle such questions can lead to an infinite regress. By using first order set theory as the metatheory, the question about the semantics of the metatheory would simply be the question about the semantics of first order logic. We have pointed out in  ยง6  that semantics of first order logic is absolute relative to ZFC. This gives some assurance that we need not continue asking, what the metatheory is.
