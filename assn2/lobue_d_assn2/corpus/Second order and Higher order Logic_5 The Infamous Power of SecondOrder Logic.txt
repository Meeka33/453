 Second-order logic has some remarkable qualities which we will now uncover in detail. Above we characterized the structure of the natural numbers by means of (\ref{ind}). This application of second-order logic is perhaps the most famous and most important. We now reformulate this in a slightly more general form in order to get more power out of it. Suppose U is a unary relation variable (“the set of natural numbers”), G a unary function variable (“the successor function”), and z an individual variable (“the zero”). Let \(\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\) be the sentence Then \((N,A,g,a)\models\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\) if and only if \((N,A,g,a)\) is isomorphic to a structure \((M,\oN,s,0)\) where \(\oN\subseteq M\) and \(s(n)=n+1\). Thus we have used second-order logic to say that the U-part of any model of \(\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\), together with the function G and the individual z are isomorphic to the natural numbers \(\oN\) with their successor function and zero. There are many ways to see that no first order sentence can have this property. For example, by the Compactness Theorem such a sentence would have also a non-standard model where some element is different from each in the sequence z, \(G(z)\), \(G(G(z))\), \(G(G(G(z)))\), \(\ldots\). Such a model cannot be isomorphic to the natural numbers \(\oN\) with their successor function and zero. Hereupon we may conclude that the Compactness Theorem does not hold for second-order logic in the form that it holds for first order logic. In models of \(\theta_{\textrm{PA}}(U,G,z)\) the formula \(\theta_+(U,G,z,H)\) and the formula \(\theta_\times(U,G,z,H,J)\) define unique functions \(m+n=H(m,n)\) and \(m\cdot n=J(m,n)\). A first order sentence \(\phi(+,\cdot,0)\) of arithmetic is true in \((\oN,+,\cdot,0)\) if and only if is valid. We know that truth of first order sentences in \((\oN,+,\cdot,0)\) is undecidable, and even non-arithmetical by results of Gödel (1931 [1986: 144–195]) and Tarski (1933 [1956]). This shows that second-order logic is not completely axiomatizable by effective means, or decidable even in the empty vocabulary. That is, there is no decidable second-order theory with an infinite model. This is in sharp contrast to first order logic where the following theories are decidable: first order logic with empty vocabulary, first order logic with monadic predicates, dense linear order, Pressburger arithmetic (first order theory of \((\oN,+,0)\)), real closed fields (first order theory of \((\oR,+,\cdot,0,1)\)), theory of algebraically closed fields, and the first order theory of \((\oC,+,\cdot,0,1)\). In second-order logic none of the respective second-order theories are decidable. However, if we restrict second-order logic to monadic second-order logic, we obtain many important decidable theories (see  §8). The Completeness Theorem is one of the cornerstones of our understanding of first order logic. Also many extensions of first order logic have a Completeness Theorem, most notably the extension of first order logic by the  generalized quantifier  “There are uncountably many” and the  infinitary language  \(L_{\omega_1\omega}\). We shall now see that there is no hope of a Completeness Theorem for second-order logic. Later in  §9.1  we shall modify the semantics so that a Completeness Theorem can be proved. Behind the failure of the Completeness Theorem is the fact that second-order logic is—almost by definition—able to say that a set is the power set of another set. What this means is the following: Let L be a vocabulary. Let E be a binary and U a unary relation symbol, both not in L. Let \(\theta_{\textrm{Pow}}(U,E)\) be the second-order formula (\ref{ex6}). Let us consider the conjunction Models of this formula are, up to isomorphism, of the form \((M,\in,N,g,a)\), where \(\P(N)=M\), \(N\cap\P(N)=\emptyset\) and \(N\) is countably infinite. Thus the models are necessarily uncountable. This shows that second-order logic, unlike first order logic, has sentences with models but only uncountable ones. Thus the Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem fails for second-order logic, as we already noted above. Combining (\ref{papow}) with the observations in  §5.1  yields the following result (by validity we mean the set of Gödel numbers of valid formulas): Theorem 3 (Hintikka 1955; Montague 1963) Validity in second-order logic is not second-order definable over \((\oN,+,\cdot,0)\). In consequence, validity in second-order logic is not \(\Sigma^1_n\) for any n. Since building power sets in the style of \(\theta_{\textrm{Pow}}(U,E)\) can be iterated, we can see that validity in second-order logic is not \(\Sigma^m_n\) for any m and n. We extend this result further below in  Theorem 6. Second-order logic hides in its semantics some of the most difficult problems of set theory. In the words of Resnik (1988: 75): In Philosophy of Logic [Quine 1970], W. V. Quine summed up a popular opinion among mathematical logicians by referring to second-order logic as “set theory in sheep’s clothing”. Let us see where this opinion might come from. First we observe that a very simple, indeed a very basic, second-order formula can say that two sets have the same cardinality: Suppose P and R are unary relation variables. Let \(\theta_{\le}(P,R)\) be the formula Now \(\mm\models_s\phi_\le(P,R)\) if and only if \(|s(P)|\le |s(R)|\). Let \(\theta_{\textrm{EQ}}(P,R)\) be the formula \(\theta_{\textrm{\le}}(P,R)\land \theta_{\textrm{\le}}(R,P)\). Now \(\mm\models_s\phi(P,R)\) if and only if \(|s(P)|=|s(R)|\). Let \(\theta'_{\textrm{EC}}(Y)\) be Now \(\mm\models_s\phi(P,R)\) if and only if the sets M and \(s(R)\) have the same cardinality. We will use these formulas to launch an attack on the Continuum Hypothesis, the notorious problem of set theory, proved independent of ZFC by Cohen in 1963 (Cohen 1966). Let \(\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\) be the sentence Now \(\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\), which is a sentence of the empty vocabulary, has a model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis CH holds. Similarly, there is a sentence \(\theta_{\neg \textrm{CH}}\), which has a model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis CH does not hold. This shows that the dependence of the semantics of second-order logic on the metatheoretic set theory is so deep that even questions that ZFC cannot solve can determine the truth or falsity of a sentence in a model. The curious quality of second-order logic is that the truth of a sentence such as \(\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\) in a big enough model of the empty vocabulary is equivalent to the truth of the Continuum Hypothesis in the set-theoretical universe. By the same technique almost any set-theoretical statement can be turned into a sentence of second-order logic, the truth of which in a big enough model of the empty vocabulary is equivalent to the truth of the statement in the set-theoretical universe. Somehow second-order logic manages to read the background set theory correctly. Does this mean that second-order logic is set theory in “sheep’s clothing”? The Axiom of Choice (AC) is a philosophical puzzle in the foundations of mathematics. Roughly speaking, this axiom, that originally emerged in set theory, says that if we have a set \(A\) of non-empty disjoint sets, then we can form a new set \(B\) which contains exactly one element from each set in \(A\). What can be seen as a problem is the fact that when \(A\) is infinite, forming the set \(B\) seems to require making an infinite number of choices. See entry on  Axiom of Choice  for a thorough definition and discussion. On the one hand the Axiom of Choice seems magic, for example when it implies that the wildest sets have a well-ordering. On the other hand it seems innocuous, for example when it implies that the Cartesian product of a family of non-empty sets is non-empty. The Axiom of Choice is typically used to construct odd “paradoxical” sets, such as a non-Lebesgue measurable set of real numbers, a well-ordering of the real numbers, a paradoxical decomposition of the sphere (see entry on  set theory),  and so on. Such sets are usually in one sense or another undefinable. For example, a non-Lebesgue measurable set of real numbers has to be undefinable in second-order logic over \((\oN,+,\cdot)\), if there are sufficiently large cardinals (see the entry on  large cardinals and determinacy). The puzzling Axiom of Choice arises also in the middle of second-order logic: Let \(\theta\) be the sentence Then \(\oR\models\theta\) essentially says that if a binary relation \(X\) relates to each \(x\in\oR\) a non-empty set \(\{y\in\oR : X(x,y\}\), then there is a function \(F\) which chooses for each \(x\in\oR\) some \(y=F(x)\) such that \(X(x,y)\). In set theory this is one of many equivalent ways of saying that the Axiom of Choice holds for (continuum size) families of subsets of \(\oR\). The basic tenet of second-order logic is that “all” properties of elements of a fixed domain exist and we can quantify over them. In set-theoretical terms this means that all subsets, definable or not, of a set of any cardinality exists and we can quantify over them. In this spirit the Axiom of Choice seems innocent and is usually accepted in the literature of second-order logic. By Cohen’s results (1966) there are N and \(N'\) satisfying the axioms of ZF (without the Axiom of Choice) such that “\(\oN\models\theta\)” holds in N but does not hold in \(N'\). This is a further demonstration of the dependence of the semantics of second-order logic on the metatheory.
