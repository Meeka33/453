 ZFC is an axiom system formulated in first-order logic with equality and with only one binary relation symbol \(\in\) for membership. Thus, we write \(A\in B\) to express that \(A\) is a member of the set \(B\). See the Supplement on Basic Set Theory for further details. See also the Supplement on Zermelo-Fraenkel Set Theory for a formalized version of the axioms and further comments. We state below the axioms of ZFC informally. Extensionality: If two sets \(A\) and \(B\) have the same elements, then they are equal. Null Set: There exists a set, denoted by \({\varnothing}\) and called the empty set, which has no elements. Pair: Given any sets \(A\) and \(B\), there exists a set, denoted by \(\{ A,B\}\), which contains \(A\) and \(B\) as its only elements. In particular, there exists the set \(\{ A\}\) which has \(A\) as its only element. Power Set: For every set \(A\) there exists a set, denoted by \(\mathcal{P}(A)\) and called the power set of \(A\), whose elements are all the subsets of \(A\). Union: For every set \(A\), there exists a set, denoted by \(\bigcup A\) and called the union of \(A\), whose elements are all the elements of the elements of \(A\). Infinity: There exists an infinite set. In particular, there exists a set \(Z\) that contains \({\varnothing}\) and such that if \(A\in Z\), then \(\bigcup\{ A, \{ A\}\}\in Z\). Separation: For every set \(A\) and every given property, there is a set containing exactly the elements of \(A\) that have that property. A property is given by a formula \(\varphi\) of the first-order language of set theory. Thus, Separation is not a single axiom but an axiom schema, that is, an infinite list of axioms, one for each formula \(\varphi\). Replacement: For every given definable function with domain a set \(A\), there is a set whose elements are all the values of the function. Replacement is also an axiom schema, as definable functions are given by formulas. Foundation: Every non-empty set \(A\) contains an \(\in\)-minimal element, that is, an element such that no element of \(A\) belongs to it. These are the axioms of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory, or ZF. The axioms of Null Set and Pair follow from the other ZF axioms, so they may be omitted. Also, Replacement implies Separation. Finally, there is the Axiom of Choice (AC): Choice: For every set \(A\) of pairwise-disjoint non-empty sets, there exists a set that contains exactly one element from each set in \(A\). The AC was, for a long time, a controversial axiom. On the one hand, it is very useful and of wide use in mathematics. On the other hand, it has rather unintuitive consequences, such as the Banach-Tarski Paradox, which says that the unit ball can be partitioned into finitely-many pieces, which can then be rearranged to form two unit balls. The objections to the axiom arise from the fact that it asserts the existence of sets that cannot be explicitly defined. But Gödel’s 1938 proof of its consistency, relative to the consistency of ZF, dispelled any suspicions left about it. The Axiom of Choice is equivalent, modulo ZF, to the Well-ordering Principle, which asserts that every set can be well-ordered, i.e., it can be linearly ordered so that every non-empty subset has a minimal element. Although not formally necessary, besides the symbol \(\in\) one normally uses for convenience other auxiliary defined symbols. For example, \(A\subseteq B\) expresses that \(A\) is a subset of \(B\), i.e., every member of \(A\) is a member of \(B\). Other symbols are used to denote sets obtained by performing basic operations, such as \(A\cup B\), which denotes the union of \(A\) and \(B\), i.e., the set whose elements are those of \(A\) and \(B\); or \(A\cap B\), which denotes the intersection of \(A\) and \(B\), i.e., the set whose elements are those common to \(A\) and \(B\). The ordered pair \((A,B)\) is defined as the set \(\{ \{ A\},\{ A,B\}\}\). Thus, two ordered pairs \((A,B)\) and \((C,D)\) are equal if and only if \(A=C\) and \(B=D\). And the Cartesian product \(A\times B\) is defined as the set of all ordered pairs \((C,D)\) such that \(C\in A\) and \(D\in B\). Given any formula \(\varphi(x,y_1,\ldots ,y_n)\), and sets \(A,B_1,\ldots ,B_n\), one can form the set of all those elements of \(A\) that satisfy the formula \(\varphi(x,B_1,\ldots ,B_n)\). This set is denoted by \(\{ a\in A: \varphi(a,B_1,\ldots ,B_n)\}\). In ZF one can easily prove that all these sets exist. See the  Supplement on Basic Set Theory for further discussion.
