 A posteriori, the ZF axioms other than Extensionality—which needs no justification because it just states a defining property of sets—may be justified by their use in building the cumulative hierarchy of sets. Namely, in ZF we define using transfinite recursion the class-function that assigns to each ordinal \(\alpha\) the set \(V_\alpha\), given as follows: \(V_0={\varnothing}\) \(V_{\alpha +1}=\mathcal{P}(V_\alpha)\) \(V_\alpha =\bigcup_{\beta <\alpha}V_\beta\), whenever \(\alpha\) is a limit ordinal. The Power Set axiom is used to obtain \(V_{\alpha +1}\) from \(V_\alpha\). Replacement and Union allow one to form \(V_\alpha\) for \(\alpha\) a limit ordinal. Indeed, consider the function that assigns to each \(\beta <\alpha\) the set \(V_\beta\). By Replacement, the collection of all the \(V_\beta\), for \(\beta <\alpha\), is a set, hence the Union axiom applied to that set yields \(V_\alpha\). The axiom of Infinity is needed to prove the existence of \(\omega\) and hence of the transfinite sequence of ordinals. Finally, the axiom of Foundation is equivalent, assuming the other axioms, to the statement that every set belongs to some \(V_\alpha\), for some ordinal \(\alpha\). Thus, ZF proves that the set theoretic universe, denoted by \(V\), is the union of all the \(V_\alpha\), \(\alpha\) an ordinal. The proper class \(V\), together with the \(\in\) relation, satisfies all the ZFC axioms, and is thus a model of ZFC. It is the intended model of ZFC, and one may think of ZFC as providing a description of \(V\), a description however that is highly incomplete, as we shall see below. One important property of \(V\) is the so-called Reflection Principle. Namely, for each formula \(\varphi(x_1,\ldots ,x_n)\), ZFC proves that there exists some \(V_\alpha\) that reflects it, that is, for every \(a_1,\ldots,a_n\in V_\alpha\), \(\varphi(a_1,\ldots ,a_n)\) holds in \(V\) if and only if \(\varphi(a_1,\ldots,a_n)\) holds in \(V_\alpha\). Thus, \(V\) cannot be characterized by any sentence, as any sentence that is true in \(V\) must be also true in some initial segment \(V_\alpha\). In particular, ZFC is not finitely axiomatizable, for otherwise ZFC would prove that, for unboundedly many ordinals \(\alpha\), \(V_\alpha\) is a model of ZFC, contradicting Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem (see  Section 5.2). The Reflection Principle encapsulates the essence of ZF set theory, for as shown by Levy (1960), the axioms of Extensionality, Separation, and Foundation, together with the Reflection Principle, formulated as the axiom schema asserting that each formula is reflected by some set that contains all elements and all subsets of its elements (note that the \(V_\alpha\) are like this), is equivalent to ZF.
