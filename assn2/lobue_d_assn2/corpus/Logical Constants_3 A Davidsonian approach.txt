 The Quinean approach identifies the logical constants as the expressions that play a privileged, “structural” role in a systematic grammatical theory for a language. An alternative approach, due to Quine’s student  Donald Davidson,  identifies the logical constants as the expressions that play a privileged, “structural” role in a systematic theory of meaning for a language. A Davidsonian theory of meaning takes the form of a  Tarskian truth theory.  Thus, it contains two kinds of axioms: base clauses that specify the satisfaction conditions of atomic  sentences,[6]  and recursive clauses that specify the satisfaction conditions of complex sentences in terms of the satisfaction conditions of their proper  parts.[7]  For example: Base Clauses: Recursive Clauses: Davidson suggests that “[t]he logical constants may be identified as those iterative features of the language that require a recursive clause in the characterization of truth or satisfaction” (1984, 71). (In our example, “or” and “some”.) This criterion certainly gives reasonable results when applied to standard truth theories like the one above (although the sign for identity once more gets counted as nonlogical). But as Davidson goes on to observe, “[l]ogical form, in this account, will of course be relative to the choice of a metalanguage (with its logic) and a theory of truth” (1984, 71). Different truth theories can be given for the same language, and they can agree on the truth conditions of whole sentences while differing in which expressions they treat in the recursive clauses. Here are two examples (both discussed further in Evans 1976). 1. We might have recursive clauses for “large” and other gradable adjectives, along these lines: For all assignments \(a\), terms \(\tau\), and   sentences \(\phi\),   \(\cq{\tau \text{ is a large } \phi }\)  is satisfied by \(a\) iff Ref(\(\tau\), \(a\))  is a large satisfier of \(\phi\) on \(a\). (cf. Evans 1976,  203) We would in this case have to use a metalanguage with a stronger logic, one that provides rules for manipulating “large satisfier of \(\phi\) on \(a\).” (As Evans notes, all we would really need in order to derive T-sentences would be a rule licensing the derivation of \(\cq{\tau \text{ is a large satisfier of } \phi \text{ on } a}\) from \(\cq{\phi \equiv \psi}\) and \(\cq{\tau \text{ is a larger satisfier of } \psi \text{ on } a}\).) But such a metalanguage cannot be ruled out without begging the question about the logicality of “large.” 2. We might assign values to “and”, “or”, and the other truth-functional connectives in the base clauses, allowing us to get by with a single generic recursive clause for truth-functional connectives: Base: For all assignments \(a\), Ref(“or”, \(a\)) = Boolean disjunction (the binary truth function that takes the value True when either argument is True, and False otherwise). Recursive: For all assignments \(a\), sentences \(\phi, \psi\), and truth-functional connectives \(@\), \(\cq{\phi @ \psi }\) is satisfied by \(a\) iff Ref(\(@, a\))(Val(\(\phi, a\)), Val(\(\psi,a\))) = True (where Val(\(\phi, a\)) = True if \(\phi\) is satisfied by \(a\), False if \(\phi\) is not satisfied by \(a\)). (cf. Evans 1976, 214) This approach requires a stronger metatheory than the usual approach, since it requires quantification over truth functions. But it is not clear why this is an objection. It is still possible to derive T-sentences whose right sides are no more ontologically committed than the sentences named on their left sides, like So it is hard to see how the use of functions here is any more objectionable than Davidson’s own appeal to sequences or assignments of values to variables. In sum, the problem with Davidson’s truth-theoretic proposal is much like the problem discussed above with Quine’s grammatical proposal. Without further constraints on the theory of meaning (or, in Quine’s case, the grammar), it does not yield a definite criterion for logical constancy. I do not mean to suggest that either Davidson or Quine was deluded on this score. As we saw above, Quine appeals to pragmatic considerations to pick out a favored language and grammatical regimentation. No doubt Davidson would do the same, arguing (for example) that the advantages of using a simple and well-understood logic in the metalanguage outweigh any putative advantages of treating “large” and the like in recursive clauses.
