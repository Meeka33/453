 We now present some results that relate the deductive notions to their model-theoretic counterparts. The first one is probably the most straightforward. We motivated both the various rules of the deductive system \(D\) and the various clauses in the definition of satisfaction in terms of the meaning of the English counterparts to the logical terminology (more or less, with the same simplifications in both cases). So one would expect that an argument is deducible, or deductively valid, only if it is semantically valid. Theorem 18. Soundness. For any sentence \(\theta\) and set \(\Gamma\) of sentences, if \(\Gamma \vdash_D \theta\), then \(\Gamma \vDash \theta\). Proof: We proceed by induction on the number of clauses used to establish \(\Gamma \vdash \theta\).  So let \(n\) be a natural number, and assume that the theorem holds for any argument established as deductively valid with fewer than \(n\) steps. And suppose that \(\Gamma \vdash \theta\) was established using exactly \(n\) steps. If the last rule applied was \((=\)I) then \(\theta\) is a sentence in the form \(t=t\), and so \(\theta\) is logically true. A fortiori, \(\Gamma \vDash \theta\).  If the last rule applied was (As), then \(\theta\) is a member of \(\Gamma\), and so of course any interpretation that satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\) also satisfies \(\theta\). Suppose the last rule applied is (&I). So \(\theta\) has the form \((\phi \amp \psi)\), and we have \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \phi\) and \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \psi\), with \(\Gamma = \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2\). The induction hypothesis gives us \(\Gamma_1 \vDash \phi\) and \(\Gamma_2 \vDash \psi\).  Suppose that \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). Then \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma_1\), and so \(M\) satisfies \(\phi\).  Similarly, \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma_2\), and so \(M\) satisfies \(\psi\). Thus, by the clause for “\(\amp\)” in the definition of satisfaction, \(M\) satisfies \(\theta\). So \(\Gamma \vDash \theta\). Suppose the last clause applied was \((\exists\mathrm{E})\). So we have \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \exists v\phi\) and \(\Gamma_2, \phi(v|t) \vdash \theta\), where \(\Gamma = \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2\), and \(t\) does not occur in \(\phi , \theta \), or in any member of \(\Gamma_2\). We need to show that \(\Gamma\vDash\theta\). By the induction hypothesis, we have that \(\Gamma_1\vDash\exists v\phi\) and \(\Gamma_2, \phi(v|t)\vDash\theta\). Let \(M\) be an interpretation such that \(M\) makes every member of \(\Gamma\) true. So, \(M\) makes every member of \(\Gamma_1\) and \(\Gamma_2\) true. Then \(M,s\vDash\exists v\phi\) for all variable assignments \(s\), so there is an \(s'\) such that \(M,s'\vDash\phi\). Let \(M'\) differ from \(M\) only in that \(I_{M'}(t)=s'(v)\). Then, \(M',s'\vDash\phi(v|t)\) and \(M',s'\vDash\Gamma_2\) since \(t\) does not occur in \(\phi\) or \(\Gamma_2\). So, \(M',s'\vDash\theta\). Since \(t\) does not occur in \(\theta\) and \(M'\) differs from \(M\) only with respect to \(I_{M'}(t)\), \(M,s'\vDash\theta\). Since \(\theta\) is a sentence, \(s'\) doesn't matter, so \(M\vDash\theta\) as desired. Notice the role of the restrictions on \((\exists\)E) here. The other cases are about as straightforward. Corollary 19. Let \(\Gamma\) be a set of sentences. If \(\Gamma\) is satisfiable, then \(\Gamma\) is consistent. Proof: Suppose that \(\Gamma\) is satisfiable. So let \(M\) be an interpretation such that \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). Assume that \(\Gamma\) is inconsistent. Then there is a sentence \(\theta\) such that \(\Gamma \vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma \vdash \neg \theta\). By soundness (Theorem 18), \(\Gamma \vDash \theta\) and \(\Gamma \vDash \neg \theta\). So we have that \(M\vDash \theta\) and \(M\vDash \neg \theta\). But this is impossible, given the clause for negation in the definition of satisfaction. Even though the deductive system \(D\) and the model-theoretic semantics were developed with the meanings of the logical terminology in mind, one should not automatically expect the converse to soundness (or Corollary 19) to hold. For all we know so far, we may not have included enough rules of inference to deduce every valid argument. The converses to soundness and Corollary 19 are among the most important and influential results in mathematical logic. We begin with the latter. Theorem 20. Completeness. Gödel [1930]. Let \(\Gamma\) be a set of sentences. If \(\Gamma\) is consistent, then \(\Gamma\) is satisfiable. Proof: The proof of completeness is rather complex. We only sketch it here. Let \(\Gamma\) be a consistent set of sentences of \(\LKe\). Again, we assume for simplicity that the set \(K\) of non-logical terminology is either finite or countably infinite (although the theorem holds even if \(K\) is uncountable). The task at hand is to find an interpretation \(M\) such that \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). Consider the language obtained from \(\LKe\) by adding a denumerably infinite stock of new individual constants \(c_0, c_1,\ldots\) We stipulate that the constants, \(c_0, c_1,\ldots\), are all different from each other and none of them occur in \(K\). One interesting feature of this construction, due to Leon Henkin, is that we build an interpretation of the language from the language itself, using some of the constants as members of the domain of discourse. Let \(\theta_0 (x), \theta_1 (x),\ldots\) be an enumeration of the formulas of the expanded language with at most one free variable, so that each formula with at most one free variable occurs in the list eventually. Define a sequence \(\Gamma_0, \Gamma_1,\ldots\) of sets of sentences (of the expanded language) by recursion as follows: \(\Gamma_0 = \Gamma\); and \(\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n,(\exists x\theta_n \rightarrow \theta_{n}(x|c_i))\), where \(c_i\) is the first constant in the above list that does not occur in \(\theta_n\) or in any member of \(\Gamma_n\). The underlying idea here is that if \(\exists x\theta_n\)is true, then \(c_i\) is to be one such \(x\). Let \(\Gamma\) be the union of the sets \(\Gamma_n\). We sketch a proof that \(\Gamma'\) is consistent. Suppose that \(\Gamma'\) is inconsistent. By Theorem 9, there is a finite subset of \(\Gamma\) that is inconsistent, and so one of the sets \(\Gamma_m\) is inconsistent. By hypothesis, \(\Gamma_0 = \Gamma\) is consistent. Let \(n\) be the smallest number such that \(\Gamma_n\) is consistent, but \(\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n,(\exists x\theta_n \rightarrow \theta_{n}(x|c_i))\) is inconsistent. By \((\neg\)I), we have that By ex falso quodlibet (Theorem 10), \(\Gamma_n, \neg \exists x\theta_n, \exists x\theta_n \vdash \theta_n (x|c_i)\).  So by \((\rightarrow\)I), \(\Gamma_n, \neg \exists x\theta_n \vdash(\exists x\theta_n \rightarrow \theta_n (x|c_i))\).  From this and (1), we have \(\Gamma_n \vdash \neg \neg \exists x\theta_n\), by \((\neg\)I), and by (DNE) we have By (As), \(\Gamma_n, \theta_n (x|c_i), \exists x\theta_n \vdash \theta_n (x|c_i)\).  So by \((\rightarrow\)I), \(\Gamma_n, \theta_n (x|c_i)\vdash(\exists x\theta_{n} \rightarrow \theta_{n}(x|c_i))\).  From this and (1), we have \(\Gamma_n \vdash \neg \theta_n (x|c_i)\), by \((\neg\)I). Let \(t\) be a term that does not occur in \(\theta_n\) or in any member of \(\Gamma_n\). By uniform substitution of \(t\) for \(c_i\), we can turn the derivation of \(\Gamma_n \vdash \neg \theta_n (x|c_i)\) into \(\Gamma_n \vdash \neg \theta_n (x|t)\).  By \((\forall\)I), we have By (As) we have \(\{\forall v\neg \theta_n (x|v),\theta_n\}\vdash \theta_n\) and by \((\forall\)E) we have \(\{\forall v\neg \theta_n (x|v), \theta_n\}\vdash \neg \theta_n\).  So \(\{\forall v\neg \theta_n (x|v), \theta_n\}\) is inconsistent. Let \(\phi\) be any sentence of the language. By ex falso quodlibet (Theorem 10), we have that \(\{\forall v\neg \theta_n (x|v),\theta_n\}\vdash \phi\) and \(\{\forall v\neg \theta_n (x|v), \theta_n\}\vdash \neg \phi\). So with (2), we have that \(\Gamma_n, \forall v\neg \theta_n (x|v)\vdash \phi\) and \(\Gamma_n, \forall v\neg \theta_n (x|v)\vdash \neg \phi\), by \((\exists\)E). By Cut (Theorem 11), \(\Gamma_n \vdash \phi\) and \(\Gamma_n \vdash \neg \phi\). So \(\Gamma_n\) is inconsistent, contradicting the assumption. So \(\Gamma'\) is consistent. Applying the Lindenbaum Lemma (Theorem 13), let \(\Gamma''\) be a maximally consistent set of sentences (of the expanded language) that contains \(\Gamma'\). So, of course, \(\Gamma''\) contains \(\Gamma\). We can now define an interpretation \(M\) such that \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma''\). If we did not have a sign for identity in the language, we would let the domain of \(M\) be the collection of new constants \(\{c_0, c_1, \ldots \}\). But as it is, there may be a sentence in the form \(c_{i}=c_{j}\), with \(i\ne j\), in \(\Gamma''\). If so, we cannot have both \(c_i\) and \(c_j\) in the domain of the interpretation (as they are distinct constants). So we define the domain \(d\) of \(M\) to be the set \(\{c_i\) | there is no \(j\lt i\) such that \(c_{i}=c_{j}\) is in \(\Gamma''\}\). In other words, a constant \(c_i\) is in the domain of \(M\) if \(\Gamma''\) does not declare it to be identical to an earlier constant in the list. Notice that for each new constant \(c_i\), there is exactly one \(j\le i\) such that \(c_j\) is in \(d\) and the sentence \(c_{i}=c_{j}\) is in \(\Gamma''\). We now define the interpretation function \(I\). Let \(a\) be any constant in the expanded language. By \((=\)I) and \((\exists\)I), \(\Gamma''\vdash \exists x x=a\), and so \(\exists x x=a \in \Gamma''\).  By the construction of \(\Gamma'\), there is a sentence in the form \((\exists x x=a \rightarrow c_i =a)\) in \(\Gamma''\). We have that \(c_i =a\) is in \(\Gamma''\).  As above, there is exactly one \(c_j\) in \(d\) such that \(c_{i}=c_{j}\) is in \(\Gamma''\). Let \(I(a)=c_j\). Notice that if \(c_i\) is a constant in the domain \(d\), then \(I\)(c\(_i)=c_i\).  That is each \(c_i\) in \(d\) denotes itself. Let \(P\) be a zero-place predicate letter in \(K\).  Then \(I(P)\) is truth if \(P\) is in \(\Gamma''\) and \(I(P)\) is falsehood otherwise. Let \(Q\) be a one-place predicate letter in \(K\). Then \(I(Q)\) is the set of constants \(\{\)c\(_i | c_i\) is in \(d\) and the sentence \(Qc\) is in \(\Gamma''\}\). Let \(R\) be a binary predicate letter in \(K\). Then \(I(R)\) is the set of pairs of constants \(\{\langle c_i,c_j\rangle | c_i\) is in \(d, c_j\) is in \(d\), and the sentence \(Rc_{i}c_{j}\) is in \(\Gamma''\}\). Three-place predicates, etc. are interpreted similarly. In effect, \(I\) interprets the non-logical terminology as they are in \(\Gamma''\). The final item in this proof is a lemma that for every sentence \(\theta\) in the expanded language, \(M\vDash \theta\) if and only if \(\theta\) is in \(\Gamma''\). This proceeds by induction on the complexity of \(\theta\). The case where \(\theta\) is atomic follows from the definitions of \(M\) (i.e., the domain \(d\) and the interpretation function \(I\)). The other cases follow from the various clauses in the definition of satisfaction. Since \(\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma''\), we have that \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). By Theorem 15, the restriction of \(M\) to the original language \(\LKe\) and \(s\) also satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). Thus \(\Gamma\) is satisfiable. A converse to Soundness (Theorem 18) is a straightforward corollary: Theorem 21. For any sentence \(\theta\) and set \(\Gamma\) of sentences, if \(\Gamma \vDash \theta\), then \(\Gamma \vdash_D \theta\). Proof: Suppose that \(\Gamma \vDash \theta\).  Then there is no interpretation \(M\) such that M satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\) but does not satisfy \(\theta\). So the set \(\Gamma,\neg \theta\) is not satisfiable. By Completeness (Theorem 20), \(\Gamma,\neg \theta\) is inconsistent. So there is a sentence \(\phi\) such that \(\Gamma,\neg \theta \vdash \phi\) and \(\Gamma,\neg \theta \vdash \neg \phi\). By \((\neg\)I), \(\Gamma \vdash \neg \neg \theta\), and by (DNE) \(\Gamma \vdash \theta\). Our next item is a corollary of Theorem 9, Soundness (Theorem 18), and Completeness: Corollary 22. Compactness. A set \(\Gamma\) of sentences is satisfiable if and only if every finite subset of \(\Gamma\) is satisfiable. Proof: If \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\), then \(M\) satisfies every member of each finite subset of \(\Gamma\). For the converse, suppose that \(\Gamma\) is not satisfiable. Then we show that some finite subset of \(\Gamma\) is not satisfiable. By Completeness (Theorem 20), \(\Gamma\) is inconsistent. By Theorem 9 (and Weakening), there is a finite subset \(\Gamma'\subseteq \Gamma\) such that \(\Gamma'\) is inconsistent.  By Corollary \(19, \Gamma'\) is not satisfiable. Soundness and completeness together entail that an argument is deducible if and only if it is valid, and a set of sentences is consistent if and only if it is satisfiable. So we can go back and forth between model-theoretic and proof-theoretic notions, transferring properties of one to the other. Compactness holds in the model theory because all derivations use only a finite number of premises. Recall that in the proof of Completeness (Theorem 20), we made the simplifying assumption that the set \(K\) of non-logical constants is either finite or denumerably infinite. The interpretation we produced was itself either finite or denumerably infinite. Thus, we have the following: Corollary 23. Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. Let \(\Gamma\) be a satisfiable set of sentences of the language \(\LKe\). If \(\Gamma\) is either finite or denumerably infinite, then \(\Gamma\) has a model whose domain is either finite or denumerably infinite. In general, let \(\Gamma\) be a satisfiable set of sentences of \(\LKe\), and let \(\kappa\) be the larger of the size of \(\Gamma\) and denumerably infinite. Then \(\Gamma\) has a model whose domain is at most size \(\kappa\). There is a stronger version of Corollary 23. Let \(M_1 =\langle d_1,I_1\rangle\) and \(M_2 =\langle d_2,I_2\rangle\) be interpretations of the language \(\LKe\). Define \(M_1\) to be a submodel of \(M_2\) if \(d_1 \subseteq d_2, I_1 (c) = I_2 (c)\) for each constant \(c\), and \(I_1\) is the restriction of \(I_2\) to \(d_1\). For example, if \(R\) is a binary relation letter in \(K\), then for all \(a,b\) in \(d_1\), the pair \(\langle a,b\rangle\) is in \(I_1 (R)\) if and only if \(\langle a,b\rangle\) is in \(I_2 (R)\). If we had included function letters among the non-logical terminology, we would also require that \(d_1\) be closed under their interpretations in \(M_2\). Notice that if \(M_1\) is a submodel of \(M_2\), then any variable-assignment on \(M_1\) is also a variable-assignment on \(M_2\). Say that two interpretations \(M_1 =\langle d_1,I_1\rangle, M_2 =\langle d_2,I_2\rangle\) are equivalent if one of them is a submodel of the other, and for any formula of the language and any variable-assignment \(s\) on the submodel, \(M_1,s\vDash \theta\) if and only if \(M_2,s\vDash \theta\).  Notice that if two interpretations are equivalent, then they satisfy the same sentences. Theorem 25. Downward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. Let \(M = \langle d,I\rangle\) be an interpretation of the language \(\LKe\). Let \(d_1\) be any subset of \(d\), and let \(\kappa\) be the maximum of the size of \(K\), the size of \(d_1\), and denumerably infinite. Then there is a submodel \(M' = \langle d',I'\rangle\) of \(M\) such that (1) \(d'\) is not larger than \(\kappa\), and (2) \(M\) and \(M'\) are equivalent. In particular, if the set \(K\) of non-logical terminology is either finite or denumerably infinite, then any interpretation has an equivalent submodel whose domain is either finite or denumerably infinite. Proof: Like completeness, this proof is complex, and we rest content with a sketch. The downward Löwenheim-Skolem theorem invokes the axiom of choice, and indeed, is equivalent to the axiom of choice (see the entry on  the axiom of choice).  So let \(C\) be a choice function on the powerset of \(d\), so that for each non-empty subset \(e\subseteq d, C(e)\) is a member of \(e\). We stipulate that if \(e\) is the empty set, then \(C(e)\) is \(C(d)\). Let \(s\) be a variable-assignment on \(M\), let \(\theta\) be a formula of \(\LKe\), and let \(v\) be a variable. Define the \(v\)-witness of \(\theta\) over s, written \(w_v (\theta,s)\), as follows: Let \(q\) be the set of all elements \(c\in d\) such that there is a variable-assignment \(s'\) on \(M\) that agrees with \(s\) on every variable except possibly \(v\), such that \(M,s'\vDash \theta\), and \(s'(v)=c\). Then \(w_v (\theta,s) = C(q)\). Notice that if \(M,s\vDash \exists v\theta\), then \(q\) is the set of elements of the domain that can go for \(v\) in \(\theta\). Indeed, \(M,s\vDash \exists v\theta\) if and only if \(q\) is non-empty. So if \(M,s\vDash \exists v\theta\), then \(w_v (\theta,s)\) (i.e., \(C(q))\) is a chosen element of the domain that can go for \(v\) in \(\theta\). In a sense, it is a “witness” that verifies \(M,s\vDash \exists v\theta\). If \(e\) is a non-empty subset of the domain \(d\), then define a variable-assignment \(s\) to be an \(e\)-assignment if for all variables \(u, s(u)\) is in \(e\). That is, \(s\) is an \(e\)-assignment if \(s\) assigns an element of \(e\) to each variable. Define \(sk(e)\), the Skolem-hull of \(e\), to be the set: That is, the Skolem-Hull of \(e\) is the set \(e\) together with every \(v\)-witness of every formula over every \(e\)-assignment. Roughly, the idea is to start with \(e\) and then throw in enough elements to make each existentially quantified formula true. But we cannot rest content with the Skolem-hull, however. Once we throw the “witnesses” into the domain, we need to deal with \(sk(e)\) assignments. In effect, we need a set which is its own Skolem-hull, and also contains the given subset \(d_1\). We define a sequence of non-empty sets \(e_0, e_1,\ldots\) as follows: if the given subset \(d_1\) of \(d\) is empty and there are no constants in \(K\), then let \(e_0\) be \(C(d)\), the choice function applied to the entire domain; otherwise let \(e_0\) be the union of \(d_1\) and the denotations under \(I\) of the constants in \(K\). For each natural number \(n, e_{n+1}\) is \(sk(e_n)\). Finally, let \(d'\) be the union of the sets \(e_n\), and let \(I'\) be the restriction of \(I\) to \(d'\). Our interpretation is \(M' = \langle d',I'\rangle\). Clearly, \(d_1\) is a subset of \(d'\), and so \(M'\) is a submodel of \(M\). Let \(\kappa\) be the maximum of the size of \(K\), the size of \(d_1\), and denumerably infinite. A calculation reveals that the size of \(d'\) is at most \(\kappa\), based on the fact that there are at most \(\kappa\)-many formulas, and thus, at most \(\kappa\)-many witnesses at each stage. Notice, incidentally, that this calculation relies on the fact that a denumerable union of sets of size at most \(\kappa\) is itself at most \(\kappa\). This also relies on the axiom of choice. The final item is to show that \(M'\) is equivalent to \(M\): For every formula \(\theta\) and every variable-assignment \(s\) on \(M'\), The proof proceeds by induction on the complexity of \(\theta\). Unfortunately, space constraints require that we leave this step as an exercise. Another corollary to Compactness (Corollary 22) is the opposite of the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem: Theorem 26. Upward Löwenheim-Skolem Theorem. Let \(\Gamma\) be any set of sentences of \(\LKe,\) such that for each natural number \(n\), there is an interpretation \(M_n = \langle d_n,I_n\rangle\), such that \(d_n\) has at least \(n\) elements, and \(M_n\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). In other words, \(\Gamma\) is satisfiable and there is no finite upper bound to the size of the interpretations that satisfy every member of \(\Gamma\). Then for any infinite cardinal \(\kappa\), there is an interpretation \(M=\langle d,I\rangle\), such that the size of \(d\) is at least \(\kappa\) and \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). Proof: Add a collection of new constants \(\{c_{\alpha} | \alpha \lt \kappa \}\), of size \(\kappa\), to the language, so that if \(c\) is a constant in \(K\), then \(c_{\alpha}\) is different from \(c\), and if \(\alpha \lt \beta \lt \kappa\), then \(c_{\alpha}\) is a different constant than \(c_{\beta}\).  Consider the set of formulas \(\Gamma'\) consisting of \(\Gamma\) together with the set \(\{\neg c_{\alpha}=c_{\beta} | \alpha \ne \beta \}\). That is, \(\Gamma'\) consists of \(\Gamma\) together with statements to the effect that any two different new constants denote different objects. Let \(\Gamma''\) be any finite subset of \(\Gamma'\), and let \(m\) be the number of new constants that occur in \(\Gamma''\).  Then expand the interpretation \(M_m\) to an interpretation \(M_m'\) of the new language, by interpreting each of the new constants in \(\Gamma''\) as a different member of the domain \(d_m\). By hypothesis, there are enough members of \(d_m\) to do this. One can interpret the other new constants at will. So \(M_m\) is a restriction of \(M_m'\). By hypothesis (and Theorem 15), \(M'_m\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). Also \(M'_m\) satisfies the members of \(\{\neg c_{\alpha}=c_{\beta} | \alpha \ne \beta \}\) that are in \(\Gamma''\). So \(M'_m\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma''\). By compactness, there is an interpretation \(M = \langle d,I\rangle\) such that \(M\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma'\). Since \(\Gamma'\) contains every member of \(\{\neg c_{\alpha}=c_{\beta} | \alpha \ne \beta \}\), the domain \(d\) of \(M\) must be of size at least \(\kappa\), since each of the new constants must have a different denotation. By Theorem 15, the restriction of \(M\) to the original language \(\LKe\) satisfies every member of \(\Gamma\). Combined, the proofs of the downward and upward Löwenheim-Skolem theorems show that for any satisfiable set \(\Gamma\) of sentences, if there is no finite bound on the models of \(\Gamma\), then for any infinite cardinal \(\kappa\), there is a model of \(\Gamma\) whose domain has size exactly \(\kappa\). Moreover, if \(M\) is any interpretation whose domain is infinite, then for any infinite cardinal \(\kappa\), there is an interpretation \(M'\) whose domain has size exactly \(\kappa\) such that \(M\) and \(M'\) are equivalent. These results indicate a weakness in the expressive resources of first-order languages like \(\LKe\). No satisfiable set of sentences can guarantee that its models are all denumerably infinite, nor can any satisfiable set of sentences guarantee that its models are uncountable. So in a sense, first-order languages cannot express the notion of “denumerably infinite”, at least not in the model theory. (See the entry on  second-order and higher-order logic.) Let \(A\) be any set of sentences in a first-order language \(\LKe\), where \(K\) includes terminology for arithmetic, and assume that every member of \(A\) is true of the natural numbers. We can even let \(A\) be the set of all sentences in \(\LKe\) that are true of the natural numbers. Then \(A\) has uncountable models, indeed models of any infinite cardinality. Such interpretations are among those that are sometimes called unintended, or non-standard models of arithmetic. Let \(B\) be any set of first-order sentences that are true of the real numbers, and let \(C\) be any first-order axiomatization of set theory. Then if \(B\) and \(C\) are satisfiable (in infinite interpretations), then each of them has denumerably infinite models. That is, any first-order, satisfiable set theory or theory of the real numbers, has (unintended) models the size of the natural numbers. This is despite the fact that a sentence (seemingly) stating that the universe is uncountable is provable in most set-theories. This situation, known as the Skolem paradox, has generated much discussion, but we must refer the reader elsewhere for a sample of it (see the entry on  Skolem’s paradox and  Shapiro 1996).
