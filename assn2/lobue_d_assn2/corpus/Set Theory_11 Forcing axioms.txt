 Forcing axioms are axioms of set theory that assert that certain existential statements are absolute between the universe \(V\) of all sets and its (ideal) forcing extensions, i.e., some existential statements that hold in some forcing extensions of \(V\) are already true in \(V\). The first forcing axiom was formulated by Donald Martin in the wake of the Solovay-Tennenbaum proof of the consistency of Suslin’s Hypothesis, and is now known as Martin’s Axiom (MA). Before we state it, let us say that a partial ordering is a non-empty set \(P\) together with a binary relation \(\leq\) on \(P\) that is reflexive and transitive. Two elements, \(p\) and \(q\), of \(P\) are called compatible if there exists \(r\in P\) such that \(r\leq p\) and \(r\leq q\). An antichain of \(P\) is a subset of \(P\) whose elements are pairwise-incompatible. A partial ordering \(P\) is called ccc if every antichain of \(P\) is countable. A non-empty subset \(G\) of \(P\) is called a filter if (i) every two elements of \(G\) are compatible, and (ii) if \(p\in G\) and \(p\leq q\), then also \(q\in G\). Finally, a subset \(D\) of \(P\) is called dense if for every \(p\in P\) there is \(q\in D\) such that \(q\leq p\). MA asserts the following: For every ccc partial ordering \(P\) and every set \(\{ D_\alpha :\alpha <\omega_1\}\) of dense subsets of \(P\), there exists a filter \(G\subseteq P\) that is generic for the set, i.e., \(G\cap D_\alpha \ne {\varnothing}\), for all \(\alpha <\omega_1\). Martin and Solovay (1970) proved that MA is consistent with ZFC, using iterated forcing with the ccc property. At first sight, MA may not look like an axiom, namely an obvious, or at least reasonable, assertion about sets, but rather like a technical statement about ccc partial orderings. It does look more natural, however, when expressed in topological terms, for it is simply a generalization of the well-known Baire Category Theorem, which asserts that in every compact Hausdorff topological space the intersection of countably-many dense open sets is non-empty. Indeed, MA is equivalent to: In every compact Hausdorff ccc topological space, the intersection of \(\aleph_1\)-many dense open sets is non-empty. MA has many different equivalent formulations and has been used very successfully to settle a large number of open problems in other areas of mathematics. For example, it implies Suslin’s Hypothesis and that every \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2\) set of reals is Lebesgue measurable and has the Baire property. It also implies the negation of the CH and that \(2^{\aleph_0}\) is a regular cardinal, but it does not decide what cardinal it is. See Fremlin (1984) for many more consequences of MA and other equivalent formulations. In spite of this, the status of MA as an axiom of set theory is still unclear. Perhaps the most natural formulation of MA, from a foundational point of view, is in terms of reflection. Writing HC for the set of hereditarily-countable sets (i.e., countable sets whose elements are countable, the elements of which are also countable, and so on), MA is equivalent to: For every ccc partial ordering \(P\), if an existential statement about \(HC\) holds in an (ideal) generic extension of \(V\) obtained by forcing with \(P\), then the statement is true, i.e., it holds in \(V\). In other words, if a set having a property that depends only on sets in \(HC\) exists in some (ideal) generic extension of \(V\) obtained by forcing with a ccc partial ordering, then a set with that property already exists in \(V\). The notion of ideal generic extension of \(V\) can be made precise in terms of so-called Boolean-valued models, which provide an alternative version of forcing. Much stronger forcing axioms than MA were introduced in the 1980s, such as J. Baumgartner’s Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), and the stronger Martin’s Maximum (MM) of Foreman, Magidor, and Shelah (1988), which is essentially the strongest possible forcing axiom. Both the PFA and MM are consistent relative to the existence of a supercompact cardinal. The PFA asserts the same as MA, but for partial orderings that have a property weaker than the ccc, called properness, introduced by Shelah. And MM asserts the same for the wider class of partial orderings that, when forcing with them, do not destroy stationary subsets of \(\omega_1\). Strong forcing axioms, such as the PFA and MM imply that all projective sets of reals are determined (PD), and have many other strong consequences in infinite combinatorics. Notably, they imply that the cardinality of the continuum is \(\aleph_2\).
