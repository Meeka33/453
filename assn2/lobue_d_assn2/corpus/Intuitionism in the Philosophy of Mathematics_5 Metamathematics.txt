 Although Brouwer developed his mathematics in a precise and fundamental way, formalization in the sense as we know it today was only carried out later by others. Indeed, according to Brouwer’s view that mathematics unfolds itself internally, formalization, although not unacceptable, is unnecessary. Others after him thought otherwise, and the formalization of intuitionistic mathematics and the study of its meta-mathematical properties, in particular of arithmetic and analysis, have attracted many researchers. The formalization of intuitionistic logic on which all formalizations are based has already been treated above. Heyting Arithmetic HA as formulated by Arend Heyting is a formalization of the intuitionistic theory of the natural numbers (Heyting 1956). It has the same non-logical axioms as Peano Arithmetic PA but it is based on intuitionistic logic. Thus it is a restriction of classical arithmetic, and it is the accepted theory of the natural numbers in almost all areas of constructive mathematics. Heyting Arithmetic has many properties that reflect its constructive character, for example the Disjunction Property that holds for intuitionistic logic too. Another property of HA that PA does not share is the numerical existence property: (\(\overline{n}\) is the numeral corresponding to natural number \(n\)) That this property does not hold in PA follows from the fact that PA proves \(\exists x (A(x) \vee \forall y \neg A(y))\). Consider, for example, the case that \(A(x)\) is the formula \(T(e,e,x)\), where \(T\) is the decidable Kleene predicate expressing that \(x\) is the code of a terminating computation of the program with code \(e\) on input \(e\). If for every \(e\) there would exist a number \(n\) such that \({\bf PA}\vdash T(e,e,n) \vee \forall y \neg T(e,e,y)\), then by checking whether \(T(e,e,n)\) holds it would be decided whether a program \(e\) terminates on input \(e\). This, however, is in general undecidable. Markov’s rule is a principle that holds both classically and intuitionistically, but only for HA the proof of this fact is nontrivial: Since HA proves the law of the excluded middle for every primitive recursive predicate, it follows that for such \(A\) the derivability of \(\neg\neg \exists x A(x)\) in HA implies the derivability of \(\exists x A(x)\) as well. From this it follows that PA is \(\Pi^0_2\)-conservative over HA. That is, for primitive recursive \(A\):  \[  {\bf PA} \vdash \forall x \exists y A(x,y)   \Rightarrow   {\bf HA} \vdash \forall x \exists y A(x,y). \]   Thus the class of provably recursive functions of HA coincides with the class of provably recursive functions of PA, a property that, on the basis of the ideas underlying constructivism and intuitionism, may not come as a surprise. The formalization of intuitionistic mathematics covers more than arithmetic. Large parts of analysis have been axiomatized from a constructive point of view (Kleene 1965, Troelstra 1973). The constructivity of these systems can be established using functional, type theoretic, or realizability interpretations, most of them based on or extensions of Gödel’s Dialectica interpretation (Gödel 1958, Kreisel 1959), Kleene realizability (Kleene 1965), or type theories (Martin-Löf 1984). In these interpretations the functionals underlying constructive statements, such as for example the function assigning a \(y\) to every \(x\) in \(\forall x\exists y A(x,y)\), are made explicit in various ways. In (Scott 1968 and 1970), a topological model for the second-order intuitionistic theory of analysis is presented where the reals are interpreted as continuous functions from Baire space into the classical reals. In this model Kripke’s Schema as well as certain continuity axioms hold. In (Moschovakis 1973), this method is adapted to construct a model of theories of intuitionistic analysis in terms of choice sequences. Also in this model Kripke’s Schema and certain continuity axioms hold. In (Van Dalen 1978) Beth models are used to provide a model of arithmetic and choice sequences that satisfy choice schemata, instances of weak continuity and Kripke’s Schema. In this model the domains at every node are the natural numbers, so that one does not have to use nonstandard models, as in the case of Kripke models. Moreover, the axioms CS1–3 of the creating subject can be interpreted in it, thus showing this theory to be consistent. There exist axiomatizations of the lawless sequences, and they all contain extensions of the continuity axioms (Kreisel 1968, Troelstra 1977). In particular in the form of the Axiom of Open Data stating that for \(A(\alpha)\) not containing other nonlawlike parameters besides \(\alpha\): In (Troelstra 1977), a theory of lawless sequences is developed (and justified) in the context of intuitionistic analysis. Besides axioms for elementary analysis it contains, for lawless sequences, strengthened forms of the axioms of open data, continuity, decidability and density (density says that every finite sequence is the initial segment of a lawless sequence). What is especially interesting is that in these theories quantifiers over lawless sequences can be eliminated, a result that can also be viewed as providing a model of lawlike sequences for such theories. Other classical models of the theory of lawless sequences have been constructed in category theory in the form of sheaf models (van der Hoeven and Moerdijk 1984). In (Moschovakis 1986), a theory for choice sequences relative to a certain set of lawlike elements is introduced, along with a classical model in which the lawless sequences turn out to be exactly the generic ones. The Creating Subject, introduced in Section 2.2, can generate choice sequences, which are some of the most important and complicated mathematical entities of Brouwer’s Intuitionism. Several philosophers and mathematicians have tried to develop the theory of the Creating Subject further mathematically as well as philosophically. In the formalization of the notion of the Creating Subject its temporal aspect is formalized using the notation \(\Box_n A\), that denotes that the Creating Subject has a proof of A at time n (in some other formulations: experiences the truth of \(A\) at time \(n\)). Georg Kreisel (1967) introduced the following three axioms for the Creating Subject, which taken together are denoted by CS: In the version of Anne Troelstra (1969) the last axiom is strengthened to The first axiom CS1 is uncontroversial: at any point in time, it can be established whether the Creating Subject has a proof of a given statement or not. The second axiom CS2 clearly uses the fact that the Creating Subject is an idealization since it expresses that proofs will always be remembered. The last axiom CS3 is the most disputed part of the formalization of the Creating Subject, or better, its second conjunct \((A \rightarrow \neg\neg\exists n\Box_n A)\) is, which was given the name Axiom of Christian Charity by Kreisel. Göran Sundholm (2014), for example, argues that Axiom of Christian Charity is not acceptable from a constructive point of view. And Gödel’s incompleteness theorem even implies that the principle is false when \(\Box_n A\) would be interpreted as being provable in a sufficiently strong proof system, which, however, is certainly not the interpretation that Brouwer had in mind. Given a statement \(A\) that does not contain any reference to time, i.e. no occurrence of \(\Box_n\), one can define a choice sequence according to the following rule (Brouwer 1953): From this follows the principle known as Kripke’s Schema KS, introduced in Section 2.2, a principle that unlike the axioms of the theory of the Creating Subject, contains no explicit reference to time: \(\exists \alpha (A \leftrightarrow \exists n \alpha(n) = 1)\). Using Kripke’s Schema, the weak counter example arguments can be expressed formally without any reference to the Creating Subject. The following example is taken from (van Atten 2018). Let A be a statement for which at present \(\neg A \vee \neg\neg A\) is not known to hold. Using KS one obtains choice sequences \(\alpha_1\) and \(\alpha_2\) such that Associate with these two sequences the real numbers \(r_0\) and \(r_1\), where for \(i=0,1\): Then for \(r=r_0 + r_1\), statement \(\neg A \vee \neg\neg A\) is implied by \((r\gt 0\vee r\lt 0)\), which shows that \((r\gt 0\vee r\lt 0)\) cannot be proved. In (van Dalen 1978) a model is constructed of the axioms for the Creating Subject in the context of arithmetic and choice sequences, thus proving them to be consistent with intuitionistic arithmetic and certain parts of analysis. In (van Dalen 1982), CS is proven to be conservative over Heyting Arithmetic. Mathematical consequences of Kripke’s Schema can be found in (van Dalen 1997), where it is shown that KS and the continuity axioms reject Markov’s principle, while KS together with Markov’s principle implies the principle of the excluded middle. Kripke has shown that KS implies the existence of nonrecursive functions, a result not published by him but by Kreisel (1970). Clearly, this implies that the theory CS also implies the existence of a nonrecursive function. A possible argument for CS runs as follows. Suppose \(X\) is a noncomputable but computably enumerable set and define the function \(f\) as follows: Then it follows that \(n\not\in X\) if and only if \(f(m,n)=1\) for some natural number \(m\), which implies that \(f\) cannot be computable. For if so, the complement of \(X\) would be computably enumerable, implying the computability of \(X\). Since \(f\) is a function from the intuitionistic point of view, this establishes that in Intuitionism not all functions are computable. Formalizations that are meant to serve as a foundation for constructive mathematics are either of a set-theoretic (Aczel 1978, Myhill 1975) or type-theoretic (Martin-Löf 1984) nature. The former theories are adaptations of Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory to a constructive setting, while in type theory the constructions implicit in constructive statements are made explicit in the system. Set theory could be viewed as an extensional foundation of mathematics whereas type theory is in general an intensional one. In recent years many models of parts of such foundational theories for intuitionistic mathematics have appeared, some of them have been mentioned above. Especially in topos theory (van Oosten 2008) there are many models that capture certain characteristics of intuitionism. There are, for example, topoi in which all total real functions are continuous. Functional interpretations such as realizability as well as interpretations in type theory could also be viewed as models of intuitionistic mathematics and most other constructive theories. In reverse mathematics one tries to establish for mathematical theorems which axioms are needed to prove them. In intuitionistic reverse mathematics one has a similar aim, but then with respect to intuitionistic theorems: working over a weak intuitionistic theory, axioms and theorems are compared to each other. The typical axioms with which one wishes theorems to compare are the fan principle and the bar principle, Kripke’s schema and the continuity axioms. In (Veldman 2011), equivalents of the fan principle over a basic theory called Basic Intuitionistic Mathematics are studied. It is shown that the fan principle is equivalent to the statement that the unit interval [0,1] has the Heine-Borel property, and from this many other equivalents are derived. In (Veldman 2009), the fan principle is shown to also be equivalent to Brouwer’s Approximate Fixed-Point Theorem. In (Lubarsky et al. 2012), reverse mathematics is applied to a form of Kripke’s schema, which is shown to be equivalent to certain topological statements. There are many more of such examples from intuitionistic reverse mathematics. Especially in the larger field of constructive reverse mathematics there are many results of this nature that are also relevant from the intuitionistic point of view.
