 Before mathematicians assert something (other than an axiom) they are supposed to have proved it true. What, then, do mathematicians mean when they assert a disjunction \(P \vee Q\), where \(P\) and \(Q\) are syntactically correct statements in some (formal or informal) mathematical language? A natural — although, as we shall see, not the unique — interpretation of this disjunction is that not only does (at least) one of the statements \(P, Q\) hold, but also we can decide which one holds. Thus just as mathematicians will assert \(P\) only when they have decided that \(P\) holds by proving it, they may assert \(P \vee Q\) only when they either can produce a proof of \(P\) or else produce one of \(Q\). With this interpretation, however, we run into a serious problem in the special case where \(Q\) is the negation, \(\neg P\), of \(P\). To assert \(\neg P\) is to show that \(P\) implies a contradiction (such as \(0 = 1)\). But it will often be that mathematicians have neither a proof of \(P\) nor one of \(\neg P\). To see this, we need only reflect on the following Goldbach conjecture (GC): Every even integer \(\gt 2\) can be written as a sum of two primes, which remains neither proved nor disproved despite the best efforts of many of the leading mathematicians since it was first raised in a letter from Goldbach to Euler in 1742. We are forced to conclude that, under the very natural decidability interpretation of P \(\vee Q\), only a stubborn optimist can retain a belief in the law of excluded middle (LEM): For every statement \(P\), either \(P\) or \(\neg P\) holds. Classical logic gets round this by widening the interpretation of disjunction: it interprets \(P \vee Q\) as \(\neg(\neg P\wedge \neg Q)\), or in other words, “it is contradictory that both \(P\) and \(Q\) be false”. In turn, this leads to the idealistic interpretation of existence, in which \(\exists xP(x)\) means \(\neg \forall x\neg P(x)\) (“it is contradictory that \(P(x)\) be false for every \(x\)”). It is on these interpretations of disjunction and existence that mathematicians have built the grand, and apparently impregnable, edifice of classical mathematics which serves a foundation for the physical, the social, and (increasingly) the biological sciences. However, the wider interpretations come at a cost: for example, when we pass from our initial, natural interpretation of \(P \vee Q\) to the unrestricted use of the idealistic one, \(\neg(\neg P\wedge \neg Q)\), the resulting mathematics cannot generally be interpreted within computational models such as recursive function theory. This point is illustrated by a well-worn example, the proposition: There exist irrational numbers \(a, b\) such that \(a^b\) is rational. A slick classical proof goes as follows. Either \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational, in which case we take \(a = b = \sqrt{2}\); or else \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is irrational, in which case we take \(a = \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) and \(b = \sqrt{2}\) (see Dummett 1977 [2000], 6). But as it stands, this proof does not enable us to pinpoint which of the two choices of the pair \((a,b)\) has the required property. In order to determine the correct choice of \((a,b)\), we would need to decide whether \(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational or irrational, which is precisely to employ our initial interpretation of disjunction with \(P\) the statement “\(\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}}\) is rational”. Here is another illustration of the difference between interpretations. Consider the following simple statement about the set \(\bR\) of real numbers: where, for reasons that we divulge shortly, \(x \ne 0\) means that we can find a rational number \(r\) with \(0 \lt r \lt \abs{x}\). A natural computational interpretation of (*) is that we have a procedure which, applied to any real number \(x\), either tells us that \(x = 0\) or else tells us that \(x \ne 0\). (For example, such a procedure might output 0 if \(x = 0\), and 1 if \(x \ne 0\).) However, because the computer can handle real numbers only by means of finite rational approximations, we have the problem of underflow, in which a sufficiently small positive number can be misread as 0 by the computer; so there cannot be a decision procedure that justifies the statement (*). In other words, we cannot expect (*) to hold under our natural computational interpretation of the quantifier \(\forall\) and the connective \(\vee\). Let’s examine this from another angle. Let \(G(n)\) act as shorthand for the statement “\(2n + 2\) is a sum of two primes”, where \(n\) ranges over the positive integers, and define an infinite binary sequence \(\ba = (a_1 ,a_2,\ldots)\) as follows: There is no question that \(\ba\) is a computationally well-defined sequence, in the sense that we have an algorithm for computing \(a_n\) for each \(n\): check the even numbers \(4,6,8,\ldots ,2n+2\) to determine whether each of them is a sum of two primes; in that case, set \(a_n = 0\), and in the contrary case, set \(a_n = 1\). Now consider the real number whose \(n\)th binary digit is \(a_n\): If (*) holds under our computational interpretation, then we can decide between the following two alternatives: In the latter case, by testing \(a_1 ,\ldots ,a_N\), we can find \(n \le N\) such that \(a_n = 1\). Thus the computational interpretation of (*) enables us to decide whether there exists \(n\) such that \(a_n = 1\); in other words, it enables us to decide the status of the Goldbach Conjecture. An example of this type, showing that a constructive proof of some classical result \(P\) would enable us to solve the Goldbach conjecture (and, by similar arguments, many other hitherto open problems, such as the Riemann hypothesis), is called a Brouwerian example for, or even a Brouwerian counterexample to, the statement \(P\) (though it is not a counterexample in the normal sense of that word). The use of the Goldbach Conjecture here is purely dramatic. For, the argument of the preceding paragraph can be modified to show that, under our computational interpretation, (*) implies the limited principle of omniscience (LPO): For each binary sequence \((a_1 ,a_2, \ldots)\) either \(a_n = 0\) for all \(n\) or else there exists \(n\) such that \(a_n = 1\), which is generally regarded as an essentially nonconstructive principle for several reasons. First, its recursive interpretation, There is a recursive algorithm which, applied to any recursively defined binary sequence \((a_1 ,a_2, \ldots)\), outputs 0 if \(a_n = 0\) for all \(n\), and outputs 1 if \(a_n = 1\) for some \(n\), is provably false within recursive function theory, even with classical logic (see Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 3); so if we want to allow a recursive interpretation of all our mathematics, then we cannot use LPO. Secondly, there is a model theory (Kripke models) in which it can be shown that LPO is not constructively derivable (Bridges & Richman [1987], Chapter 7).
