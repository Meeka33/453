 In what follows, we shall suppose that the second-order predicate calculus with which we began has been extended with (a) a primitive \(\#\) operator, so that we can formulate terms such as \(\#F\) to signify ‘the number of \(F\)s’, and (b) a new axiom, namely, Hume’s Principle, to govern the new terms. As previously mentioned, Frege’s Theorem is that the Dedekind/Peano axioms of number theory are derivable as theorems in a second-order predicate calculus extended in this way. In this section, we introduce the definitions required for the proof of Frege’s Theorem. In the next section, we go through the proof. In the final section, we conclude with a discussion of the philosophical questions that arise when we extend the predicate calculus in this way, and take Hume’s Principle as a replacement for Basic Law V. Before we turn to the definitions required for the proof of Frege’s Theorem, it would serve well to discuss one other group of insights underlying Frege’s analysis of numbers. The first is that the following series of concepts has a rather interesting property: The interesting property of this series is that for each concept \( C_k\), all and only the numbers of the concepts preceding \(C_k\) in the sequence fall under \(C_k\). So, for example, the concepts preceding \(C_3\) are \(C_0\), \(C_1\), and \( C_2\). Accordingly, all and only the following numbers fall under \( C_3:\#C_0, \#C_1\), and \(\#C_2\). Frege’ next insight was that these concepts can be used, respectively, to define the finite cardinal numbers, as follows: This insight, however, led to another. Frege realized that though we may identify this sequence of numbers with the natural numbers, such a sequence is simply a list: it does not constitute a definition of a concept (e.g., natural number) that applies to all and only the numbers defined in the sequence. Such a concept is required if we are to prove as theorems the following axioms of Dedekind/Peano number theory: Moreover, Frege recognized the need to employ the Principle of Mathematical Induction in the proof that every number has a successor. One cannot prove the claim that every number has a successor simply by producing the sequence of expressions for cardinal numbers (e.g., the second of the two sequences described above). All such a sequence demonstrates is that for every expression listed in the sequence, one can define an expression of the appropriate form to follow it in the sequence. This is not the same as proving that  every natural number has a successor. To accomplish these further goals, Frege proceeded (Gl, §76, and Gg I, §43) by defining the concept \(x\) (immediately) precedes \(y\): We may represent Frege’s definition formally in our language as follows: To illustrate this definition, let us temporarily assume that we know some facts about the natural numbers 1 and 2 to show that the definition properly predicts that \(\mathit{Precedes}(1,2)\), even though we haven’t yet defined these natural numbers. Let the expression ‘\([\lambda z \, Azp]\)’ denote the concept author of Principia Mathematica. Only Bertrand Russell (‘\(r\)’) and Alfred Whitehead fall under this concept. Let the expression ‘\([\lambda z \, Azp \amp z\neqclose r]\)’ denote the concept author of Principia Mathematica other than Russell.[9] Then the following may, for the purposes of this example, be taken as facts: If we assemble these truths into a conjunction and apply existential generalization in the appropriate places, the result is the definiens of the definition of predecessor instantiated to the numbers 1 and 2. Thus, if given certain facts about the number of objects falling under the certain concepts, the definition of predecessor correctly predicts that \(\mathit{Precedes}(1,2)\). Frege next defines the relation x is an ancestor of y in the R-series. This new relation is called ‘the ancestral of the relation R’ and we henceforth designate this relation as \(R^*\). Frege first defined the ancestral of a relation R in Begr (Part III, Proposition 76), though the word ‘ancestral’ comes to us from Russell and Whitehead. Frege’s phrase for the ancestral is: “\(x\) comes before \(y\) in the \(R\)-series”; alternatively, “\(y\) follows \(x\) in the \(R\)-series”. (See also Gl, §79, and Gg I, §45.) The intuitive idea is easily grasped if we consider the relation \(x\) is the father of \(y\). Suppose that \(a\) is the father of \(b\), that \(b\) is the father of \(c\), and that \(c\) is the father of \(d\). Then ‘\(x\) is an ancestor of \(y\) in the fatherhood-series’ is defined so that \(a\) is an ancestor of \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), that \(b\) is an ancestor of \(c\) and \(d\), and that \(c\) is an ancestor of \(d\). Frege’s definition of the ancestral of R requires a preliminary definition: F is hereditary in the R-series if and only if every pair of \(R\)-related objects \(x\) and \(y\) are such that \(y\) falls under \(F\) whenever \(x\) falls under \(F\) In formal terms: \(\mathit{Her}(F,R) \eqabbr \forall x\forall y(Rxy \to (Fx \to Fy))\) Intuitively, the idea is that \(F\) is hereditary in the R-series if \(F\) is always ‘passed along’ from \(x\) to \(y\) whenever \(x\) and \(y\) are a pair of R-related objects. (We warn the reader here that the notation ‘\(\mathit{Her}(F,R)\)’ is merely an abbreviation of a much longer statement. It is not a formula of our language having the form ‘\(R(x,y)\)’. In what follows, we sometimes introduce other such abbreviations.) Frege’s definition of the ancestral of \(R\) can now be stated as follows: x comes before y in the R-series \(\eqdef\) y falls under all those R-hereditary concepts F under which falls every object to which x is R-related. In other words, \(y\) follows \(x\) in the R-series whenever \(y\) falls under every R-hereditary concept \(F\) that is exemplified by everything immediately R-related to \(x\). In formal terms: \(R^*(x,y) \eqdef \forall F[(\forall z(Rxz \to Fz) \amp \mathit{Her}(F,R)) \to Fy]\) For example, Clinton’s father stands in the relation father* of (i.e., forefather) to Chelsea because she falls under every hereditary concept that Clinton and his brother inherited from Clinton’s father. However, Clinton’s brother is not one of Chelsea’s forefathers, since he fails to be her father, her grandfather, or any of the other links in the chain of fathers from which Chelsea descended. It is important to grasp the differences between a relation \(R\) and its ancestral \(R^*\). Rxy implies \(R^*(x,y)\) (e.g., if Clinton is a father of Chelsea, then Clinton is a forefather of Chelsea), but the converse doesn’t hold (Clinton’s father is a father* of Chelsea, but he is not a father of Chelsea). Indeed, a grasp of the definition of \(R^*\) should leave one able to prove the following easy consequences, many of which correspond to theorems in Begr and  Gg:[10] Facts About \(R^*\): The reader should consider what happens when \(R\) is taken to be the relation (immediately) precedes. Appealing to our intuitive grasp of the numbers, we can say that it is an instance of Fact (1) that if 10 precedes 11, then 10 precedes* 11. Moreover, precedes is a witness to Fact 2: that 10 precedes* 12 does not imply that 10 precedes 12. The transitivity of precedes* is an instance of Fact (7). Below, when we restrict ourselves to the natural numbers, it becomes intuitive to think of the difference between precedes and precedes* as the difference between immediately precedes and less-than. Given the notion of the ancestral of relation \(R\), Frege then defines its weak ancestral, which he termed “\(y\) is a member of the \(R\)-series beginning with \(x\)” (cf. Begr, Part III, Proposition 99; Gl, §81, and Gg I, §46): In formal terms: \(R^{+}(x,y) \eqdef R^*(x,y) \lor x\eqclose y\) Frege would also read \(R^{+}(x,y)\) as: \(x\) is a member of the R-series ending with \(y\). Logicians call \(R^{+}\) the ‘weak-ancestral’ of \(R\) because it is a weakened version of \(R^*\). When we define the natural numbers below, and take \(R\) to be precedes, we can intuitively regard its weak ancestral, precedes\(^{+}\), as the relation less-than-or-equal-to on the natural numbers. The general definition of the weak ancestral of \(R\) yields the following facts, many of which correspond to theorems in  Gg:[12] Facts About \(R^{+}\): The proofs of these facts are left as exercises. Frege’s definition of natural number requires one more preliminary definition. Frege identified the number 0 as the number of the concept being non-self-identical. That is: \(0 \eqdef \#[\lambda x \, x\neq x]\) Since the logic of identity guarantees that no object is non-self-identical, nothing falls under the concept being non-self-identical. Had Frege’s explicit definition of the \(\#F\) worked as he had intended, the number 0 would, in effect, be identified with the extension consisting of all those extensions of concepts under which nothing falls. However, for the present purposes, we may note that 0 is defined in terms of (a) the primitive notion ‘the number of \(F\)s’ and (b) a concept \(([\lambda x \, x\neq x])\) whose existence is guaranteed by our second-order logic with identity and comprehension. It is straightforward to prove the following Lemma Concerning Zero from this definition of 0: Lemma Concerning Zero:  \(\#F\eqclose 0 \equivwide \neg\exists xFx\) (Proof of Lemma Concerning Zero) Note that the proof appeals to Hume’s Principle and facts about equinumerosity. Frege’s definition of the concept natural number can now be stated in terms of the weak-ancestral of Predecessor: x is a natural number if and only if \(x\) is a member of the predecessor-series beginning with 0 This definition appears in Gl, §83, and Gg I, §46 as the definition of ‘finite number’. Indeed, the natural numbers are precisely the finite cardinals. In formal terms, Frege’s definition becomes: \(Nx ~ \eqdef ~ \mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x)\) In what follows, we shall sometimes use the variables \(m\), \(n\), and \(o\) to range over the natural numbers. In other words, we’ll use formulas of the form \(\forall n(\ldots n\ldots)\) to abbreviate formulas of the form \(\forall x(Nx \to \ldots x\ldots)\), and use formulas of the form \(\exists n(\ldots n\ldots)\) to abbreviate formulas of the form \(\exists x(Nx \amp \ldots x\ldots)\).
