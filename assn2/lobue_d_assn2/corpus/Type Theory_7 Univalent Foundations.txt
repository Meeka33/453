 The connections between type theory, set theory and category theory gets a new light through the work on Univalent Foundations (Voevodsky 2015) and the Axiom of Univalence. This involves in an essential way the extension of type theory described in the previous section, in particular dependent types, the view of propositions as types, and the notion of universe of types. These development are also relevant for discussing the notion of structure, the importance of which was for instance emphasized in Russell 1959. Martin-Löf 1975 [1973] introduced a new basic type \(\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)\), if \(a\) and \(b\) are in the type \(A\), which can be thought as the type of equality proofs of the element \(a\) and \(b\). An important feature of this new type is that it can be iterated, so that we can consider the type \(\mathbf{Id}_{\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)}(p,q)\) if \(p\) and \(q\) are of type \(\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)\). If we think of a type as a special kind of set, it is natural to conjecture that such a type of equality proofs is always inhabited for any two equality proofs \(p\) and \(q\). Indeed, intuitively, there seems to be at most an equality proof between two elements \(a\) and \(b\). Surprisingly, Hofmann and Streicher 1996 designed a model of dependent type theory where this is not valid, that is a model where they can be different proofs that two elements are equal. In this model, a type is interpreted by a groupoid and the type \(\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)\) by the set of isomorphisms between \(a\) and \(b\), set which may have more than one element. The existence of this model has the consequence that it cannot be proved in general in type theory that an equality type has at most one element. This groupoid interpretation has been generalized in the following way, which gives an intuitive interpretation of the identity type. A type is interpreted by a topological space, up to homotopy, and a type \(\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)\) is interpreted by the type of paths connecting \(a\) and \(b\). (See Awodey et al. 2013 and [HoTT 2013, Other Internet Resources].) Voevodsky 2015 introduced the following stratification of types. (This stratification was motivated in part by this interpretation of a type as a topological space, but can be understood directly without reference to this interpretation.) We say that a type \(A\) is a proposition if we have \(\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)\) for any element \(a\) and \(b\) of \(A\) (this means that the type \(A\) has at most one element). We say that a type \(A\) is a set if the type \(\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)\) is a proposition for any element \(a\) and \(b\) of \(A\). We say that a type \(A\) is a groupoid if the type \(\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)\) is a set for any element \(a\) and \(b\) of \(A\). The justification of this terminology is that it can be shown, only using the rules of type theory, that any such type can indeed be seen as a groupoid in the usual categorical sense, where the objects are the elements of this type, the set of morphisms between \(a\) and \(b\) being represented by the set \(\mathbf{Id}_A (a,b)\). The composition is the proof of transitivity of equality, and the identity morphism is the proof of reflexivity of equality. The fact that each morphism has an inverse corresponds to the fact that identity is a symmetric relation. This stratification can then be extended and we can define when a type is a 2-groupoid, 3-groupoid and so on. In this view, type theory appears as a vast generalization of set theory, since a set is a particular kind of type. Voevodsky 2015 introduces also a notion of equivalence between types, notion which generalizes in an uniform way the notions of logical equivalence between propositions, bijection between sets, categorical equivalence between groupoids, and so on. We say that a map \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is an equivalence if, for any element \(b\) in \(B\) the type of pairs \(a,p\) where \(p\) is of type \(\mathbf{Id}_B (f a,b)\), is a proposition and is inhabited. This expresses in a strong way that an element in \(B\) is the image of exactly one element in \(A\), and if \(A\) and \(B\) are sets, we recover the usual notion of bijection between sets. (In general if \(f:A\rightarrow B\) is an equivalence, then we have a map \(B\rightarrow A\), which can be thought of as the inverse of \(f\).) It can be shown for instance that the identity map is always an equivalence. Let \(\text{Equiv}(A,B)\) be the type of pairs \(f,p\) where \(f:A\rightarrow B\) and \(p\) is a proof that \(f\) is an equivalence. Using the fact that the identity map is an equivalence we have an element of \(\text{Equiv}(A,A)\) for any type \(A\). This implies that we have a map and the Axiom of Univalence states that this map is an equivalence. In particular, we have the implication and so if there is an equivalence between two small types then these types are equal. This Axiom can be seen as a strong form of the extensionality principle. It indeed generalizes the Axiom of propositional extensionality mentioned by Church 1940, which states that two logically equivalent propositions are equal. Surprisingly, it also implies the Axiom of function extensionality, Axiom 10 in Church 1940, which states that two pointwise equal functions are equal (Voevodsky 2015). It also directly implies that two isomorphic sets are equal, that two categorically equivalent groupoids are equal, and so one. This can be used to give a formulation of the notion of transport of structures (Bourbaki 1957) along equivalences. For instance, let \(M A\) be the type of monoid structures on the set \(A\): this is the type of tuples \(m, e, p\) where \(m\) is a binary operation on \(A\) and \(e\) an element of \(A\) and \(p\) a proof that these elements satisfy the usual monoid laws. The rule of substitution of equal by equal takes the form If there is a bijection between \(A\) and \(B\) they are equal by the Axiom of Univalence, and we can use this implication to transport any monoid structure of \(A\) in a monoid structure of \(B\). We can also use this framework to refine Russell 1959 discussion on the notion of structure. For instance, let Monoid be the type of pairs \(A,p\) where \(p\) is an element of \(M A\). Two such pairs \(A,p\) and \(B,q\) are isomorphic if there exists a bijection \(f\) from \(A\) to \(B\) such that \(q\) is equal to the transport of structure of \(p\) along \(f\). A consequence of the Axiom of Univalence is that two isomorphic elements of the type Monoid are equal, and hence shares the same properties. Notice that such a general transport of properties is not possible when structures are formulated in a set theoretic framework. Indeed, in a set theoretic framework, it is possible to formulate properties using the membership relations, for instance the property that the carrier set of the structure contains the natural number \(0\), property that is not preserved in general by isomorphisms. Intuitively, the set theoretical description of a structure is not abstract enough since we can talk about the way this structure is built up. This difference between set theory and type theory is yet another illustration of the characterization by J.Reynolds 1983 of a type structure as a “syntactical discipline for enforcing level of abstraction”.
