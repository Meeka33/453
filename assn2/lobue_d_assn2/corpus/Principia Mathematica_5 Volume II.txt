 The writing of this preface delayed the publication of the second volume of PM, as Whitehead and Russell struggled over the complications it raised. The difficulties arise from the typical ambiguity of terms and formulas of the theory of types. Every constant, such as those for the numbers \(0,1, \ldots, \aleph_0\) will have a definition relative to each type. Without assuming the Axiom of Infinity for individuals, there is no guarantee that a given constant designates a non-empty class in a given type. The preface introduces the notion of “formal numbers”, which are to be interpreted as belonging to a type that makes them not identical with the \(\emptyset\) for that type. Volume II begins with Part III, “Cardinal Arithmetic”. The notions of cardinal numbers are developed in full generality, extending to infinite cardinals. Consequently the theory of natural numbers, which are called “Inductive Cardinals” in PM, is introduced with a series of definitions of special cases of notions that are first introduced in a general form applying to any numbers or classes. For example, addition of natural numbers, as in the famous proof that \(1 + 1 = 2\) in ∗110·04 is proved with for the special case of the addition of classes that applies to cardinal numbers, ‘\(+_c\)’. The Summary to section A introduces the notion of homogenous cardinals, which are classes of similar classes whose members are all of the same type. It is possible to define similarity between two classes \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) of distinct types say \(\tau\) and \(\tau '\), and cardinals are classified as descending and ascending as the domain of the relevant similarity relation is of a higher type than the range, and when of a lower type, respectively. The theory of cardinal numbers is straightforward with homogenous cardinals, however the exceptions must be kept in mind, as is evidenced in ∗100. Cardinal Numbers are classes of equinumerous (similar) classes. We can add a notion of the number of a class to allow for a direct comparison with Frege: (In set theory of course this is too large to be a set, and so is just a “proper class”.) Hume’s Principle which is described in Frege (1884: §63) as asserting that the content of the proposition that “the number which belongs to the concept F is the same as the number which belongs to the concept G” is equivalent to “the concept F is similar to the concept G”. In terms of classes this becomes \(\alpha \approx \beta \equiv \# \alpha = \# \beta\). Hume’s principle is the focus of much of the discussion of “Neo-Logicism”, the doctrine that Frege’s construction of the numbers can be built on a consistent foundation (see the entry on   Frege’s theorem). Only one direction of this equivalence is provable in PM: The failure of the other direction, the implication from right to left, is due to the possibility that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are of different types, so that any similarity relation between them will have its domain and range in different types. Suppose there are \(\aleph_0\) individuals, and consider two higher types with the cardinals in them of even larger, but distinct, cardinalities, say \(\alpha\) in some high type has cardinality \(\aleph_1\) and that \(\beta\) in an even higher type and has cardinality \(\aleph_2\). There are no sets of individuals similar to \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\), so no similarity relation with a domain in \(\alpha\) or \(\beta\) will hold with respect to any set in the type of individuals. Suppose that \(\#\) is defined in terms of such descending relation. Therefore \(\# \alpha = \{ \Lambda \} = 0\) and \(\# \beta = \{ \Lambda \} = 0\) so \(\# \alpha = \# \beta\), yet \(\alpha \not\approx \beta\) on any similarity relation of whatever domain and range, because their cardinalities differ. Whitehead and Russell assert that the case of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) being in different types is the only way to construct an exception to this direction of Hume’s principle, and offer as a restricted version: The antecedent guarantees that \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are of the same type, and so the cardinal numbers involved are homogenous cardinals. (Landini (2016) argues that this section of PM is confused.) The class of all classes equinumerous with the empty set is just the singleton containing the empty set, so \(0 = \{ \emptyset \}\). The arithmetic sum of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is the union of \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) after they are made disjoint by pairing each element of \(\beta\) with \(\{ \alpha \}\) and each element of \(\alpha\) with \(\{ \beta \}\). The classes \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are intersected with the empty class, \(\emptyset\), to adjust the type of the elements of the sum. It is more recognizable to contemporary set theory by the equivalent defintion: The cardinal sum of y and x \(y +_c x\) expresses the cardinal addition of cardinals y and x. It is the arithmetical sum of “homogeneous cardinals”, cardinals of a uniform type, to which \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are related by \(\rN_0 c\) (itself defined at [∗103·01]). The notation indicating that \(\alpha\) is a homogenous cardinal \(\alpha\) is \(\rN_0 c\pmsq\alpha\), which we might write as \(\#_0\) in an extension of our contemporary notation replacing \(\#\) above. The reader can now appreciate the notorious fact that \(1 +1=2\), the most elementary truth of arithmetic, is not proved until page 83 of Volume II of Principia Mathematica, and even then, almost as an afterthought: Whitehead and Russell remark that “The above proposition is occasionally useful. It is used at least three times, in…”. This witticism reminds us that the theory of natural numbers, so central to Frege’s works, appears in PM as only a special case of a general theory of cardinal and ordinal numbers and even more general classes of isomorphic structures. Exponentiation for cardinals is defined in such a way that it coincides with Cantor’s notion that the cardinality of the powerset of a class \(\alpha\) is 2 raised to the power of the cardinality of \(\alpha\): Cantor’s Theorem: This is Cantor’s theorem that the if a set \(\alpha\) has a cardinal number y then the cardinal number \(2^{y}\) of the powerset of \(\alpha\) is greater than y. The most direct comparison with Frege’s development of the natural numbers comes with the notion of Inductive Cardinal by which PM means the natural numbers 0, 1, 2,…, and the theory of these numbers including the principle of induction. Although the numbers 0 and 1, as well as addition of natural numbers \(+_c\) is has been defined earlier, they are defined as cardinal numbers and addition will apply to all cardinal numbers, finite and transfinite. For the finite natural numbers, special notions need to be defined first. For the proof of the Peano Postulates it is necessary not only to define 0, but also the notion of successor. For Frege the notion of (weak) predecessor of a number is defined, thus 0 and 1 are the predecessors of 1, while 0, 1 and 2 are 1 the predecessors of 2, etc. The successor of n is then defined by counting the predecessors of a number, in terms of the definition of number, it is the number of the class of predecessors. This definition would not work for PM, where each number would be of a higher type, as it is defined as a set containing that number. There will in fact be natural numbers for each type, thus a set of all pairs of individuals of type 0, a set of pairs of sets of type 1, etc., for each type. There is no one type, however, at which there are all of the natural numbers (sets of equinumerous sets of that type) without an assumption that there are infinitely many members of some one type. The solution in PM is to guarantee that for each finite set of n individuals of type 0, there will be some object not in that set, which can be included the set defining the successor. That such a new individual can be found is guaranteed by the Axiom of Infinity, which in effect asserts the existence of distinct individuals of any finite number. It is interesting to note the the “Axiom” of Infinity is not a primitive proposition of the logic of PM. Instead it is an additional hypothesis, to be used as an antecedent to mathematical assertions upon which it depends. The issue of whether the system of PM succeeds as logicism is thus not settled by noting that an Axiom of Infinity has to be assumed, but by determining whether that “Axiom” is derivable from logical principles alone. In axiomatic set theory the “Axiom of Infinity” guarantees the existence of a particular set, the ordinal \(\omega\): The inductive cardinals (natural numbers) are defined as the numbers bearing the ancestral of the \(+_1\) relation to 0. Given that the \(+_1\) relation is the PM account of successor this is the same definition as for Frege. Inductive Cardinals N The inductive cardinals N are the familiar natural numbers, namely 0 and all those cardinal numbers that are related to 0 by the ancestral of the “successor relation” S, where \(x\relS y\) just in case \(y = x +1\). This Axiom of Infinity asserts that all inductive cardinals are non-empty. (Recall that \(0 = \{\emptyset \}\), and so 0 is not empty.) The axiom is not a “primitive proposition” but instead to be listed as an “hypothesis” where used, that is as the antecedent of a conditional, where the consequent will be said to depend on the axiom. Technically is not an axiom of PM as ∗120·03 is a definition, so this is just further defined notation in PM! Whitehead and Russell do carry out the step of the logicist program of deriving Peano’s Postulates based on the prior definitions of the notions of Natural number, 0, and successor, as Russell describes the project later, in (1919). This is in fact what is done in ∗120 “Inductive Cardinals” of PM, but is not described as such, either there or in introductory material. The results are not proved separately, but as they appear in a development of various results about natural numbers. Indeed some, such as ∗120·31, can only be seen to be versions of a Peano axiom with a bit of work. In contemporary set theory the notion of the successor of a number is defined directly for the ordinals as \(s(x) = \{ x \cup \{x \} \}\) rather than by adding 1, and addition is defined using the familiar recursive definition: The use of recursive definitions is justified by a theorem proving that they describe a unique function. The induction axiom is justified by showing that any class that contains 0, and for any number n contains \(s(n)\) will contain all of the numbers in \(\omega\). The existence of \(\omega\) is guaranteed by the ZF axiom of infinity. At this point, after 225 pages in Volume II, the reader will see how to compare the logicist reduction of arithmetic in PM with rival accounts of Frege and of contemporary set theory. Frege completes his development of the natural numbers at page 68 of the Volume II of his Basic Laws of Arithmetic published in 1903, which follows the 250 pages of Volume I that had been published in 1893. So both Frege and the authors of PM took great pains to prove more advanced theorems only after a chain of closely argued lemmas based on their own formalized symbolic logic. Frege ends his deductions of the laws of arithemtic with results about the notions of 0, Successor, and the principle of Induction which include the Peano Axioms. He does not consider arithmetical functions, such as addition or multiplication, and thus does not define the successor of a number n as the result of adding 1 to n. Frege’s account is streamlined in other ways as well. He had always considered the analysis of simple identity sentences to be important to his logicism, dating back to the Begriffsschrift (1879), on through his Foundations of Arithmetic (1884) and his “On Sense and Reference” (1892), and even in the appearance of the example “\(2^2 = 2 + 2\)” in the forward to the Basic Laws of Arithmetic. Indeed the analysis of identity sentences is the starting point of his introduction of the theory of sense and reference in 1879, yet Frege does not diverge from his project enough to show how such an identity would be proved. So Whitehead and Russell might well have wanted to include their proof of \(1+1 = 2\) at ∗110·643 as a reminder of the analysis of mathematical equations in PM using the “descriptive functions” of ∗30 and then the account of definite descriptions in ∗14. Frege also does not construct the general theory of the arithmetic of cardinal and ordinal numbers that occupies PM for much of Part III. Indeed, after the theorems on Arithmetic in §54 which concludes Part II of Basic Laws of Arithmetic, Frege jumps directly to the topic of Real Numbers for the remainder of Volume II. Judging simply on the amount of theorems that had to be proved in leading to the account of Peano Arithmetic, PM does not differ wildly from Frege’s earlier attempt. Admittedly the system of PM is an indirect and cumbersome system to develop if the theory of Arithmetic were the only goal in mind. Firstly, however, the system of the ramified theory of types is independently interesting for the foundations of logic that it provides. After ∗20 the theory of classes, and development of general notions of arithmetic for relations which follows, does present the arithmetic of the natural numbers as a special case which can be generalized to the arithmetic of ordinal and cardinal numbers all in a logic with a simple hierarcy of types. The survey below of what follows in Volume II and Volume III shows the particular way of developing the theory of rational and then real numbers that PM follows. The results in set theory will seem primitive, as the results are dated to around 1908, at just the point when axiomatic set theory began its extraordinary development. Whitehead and Russell were not active contributors to set theory and so PM should not be studied for later technical results that may have been anticipated here. Russell summarized results in PM from the current state of the study of infinite cardinals and ordinals in a paper he give in Paris in a paper called “On the Axioms of the Infinite and Transfinite” (Russell 1911). There is, however, one result concerning two notions of infinity that appears to originate with PM. In PM a class is a finite “inductive” class if and only if it can be put into a one to one correspondence with the Natural Numbers less than or equal to some natural number 1. It will be infinite if and only if it is A class is Dedekind Infinite (Reflexive) if and only if it can be put in a one to one correspondence with a proper subset of itself. The key theorem in this section is: The Inductive and Reflexive notions of infinity coincide if one assumes that axiom of Choice. This result does not assume the axiom of Choice. George Boolos (1994: 27) describes the details of this argument and quotes J.R. Littlewood as saying: He [Russell] has a secret craving to have proved some straight mathematical theorem. As a matter of fact there is one: “\(2^{2^{\alpha}} > \aleph_0\) if \(\alpha\) is infinite”. Perfectly good mathematics. As use of the Axiom of Choice is explicitly indicated, and many results do not use it, the unique contribution to set theory of PM may be in its indication of what can be proved without assuming Choice. Relation Arithmetic is the study of the generalization of cardinal and ordinal numbers to classes of similar classes where similarity is based on an arbitrary relation. A relation P is similar to a relation Q, if there is a one to one relation S (a correlator) relating the domain of P to the domain of Q so that if \(x\relP y\) for some x and y then if \(x\relP y\) and \(y\relQ z\) then \(z \relbS y\). The mapping S is an isomorphism between the relations P and Q. A relation number will then be a class of relations that are similar to each other. Relation Arithmetic then generalizes the notions of cardinal arithmetic such as sum and product, to arbitrary relation numbers. The later portions of PM should thus be studied for a hint of how the real numbers and the use of mathematics in measurement can be developed with this rival foundation on the theory of relations. Gandon (2008, 2012) argues that the issue of the application of mathematics is better explained by the logicism of PM. Russell himself expressed regret that the material in Part IV was not more carefully studied by his contemporaries (Russell 1959: 86). Scholars of the history of logic will certainly continue to look through these later portions of PM which follow ∗120. P and Q are similar ordinally (\(P \smor Q\)) just in case there is a one to one mapping of the domain of P into the domain of Q such if \(x\relR y\) and \(y\relQ z\) then \(z \relbS y\). The sum of relations P and Q, \(P \oplus Q\), is defined as: As it is put in the headnote to ∗160: …we may regard the sum of P and Q as a relation which holds between x and y when either x precedes y in the P series, or x precedes y in the Q series, or x belongs to the P-series and y belongs to the Q-series. The product of relations P and Q, \(P \otimes Q\), is defined as: lt follows from the definition that the relation \(P \otimes Q\) will relate pairs \(\langle x, z \rangle\) and \(\langle y,w \rangle\) as follows: It is possible to prove results about the sums and products of relations that show the differences between products and sums of relations and of numbers. The relation of product is associative: The relations distribute in one way: However, it does not hold in general that: For the purposes of defining rational and real numbers as relations between relations, it is necessary to define the ordering relation between individuals related by the relation, that is, in the domain or range (the field) of the relations. This is described in the summary of ∗170 as follows: …\(\alpha\) is said to precede \(\beta\)…if we consider the two classes \(\alpha - \beta\) and \(\beta - \alpha\), there are members of \(\alpha - \beta\) which are not preceded by any members of \(\beta - \alpha\). (Vol. II, 1912: 411 and 1927: 399) The notions of the sum and product of relation numbers is defined as the relation number of the sum and product of the relations, with adjustments made so that the types of the relations are uniform, and the numbers contain disjoint relations, as was seen in the definition of sum for cardinal numbers in ∗110 above. If x and y are relation numbers, their sum is \(x \dot{+} y\) and the product is \(x \dot{\times} y\). It is proved that operation of sum for relation numbers is associative and other properties that directly follow from the corresponding properties of the sums and products of relations. Among the many theorems is the fact that sum for relation numbers is associative: The distribution of product of relation numbers over sum for relation numbers holds in one form: A series (linear ordering) is defined as a relation that is antisymmetric \(\forall x (\lnot x\relR x)\), transitive \(\forall x \forall y \forall z (x\relR y \lamp y\relR z \supset x\relR z)\), and connected \(\forall x \forall y (x\relR y \lor y\relR x)\). (∗204·01) (These properties are restricted to a specific domain for each relation. Thus a connected relation will hold between any two members of a given domain.) This is now called a linear ordering of a given set. Thus sequents of \(\alpha\) are its immediate successors. If \(\alpha\) has a maximum, the sequents are the immediate successors of the maximum; but if \(\alpha\) has no maximum, there will be no one term of \(\alpha\) which is immediately succeeded by a sequent of \(\alpha\); in this case, if \(\alpha\) has a single sequent, the sequent is the “upper limit” of \(\alpha\). (PM Vol. II, “Summary of ∗205”, 1912: 577 or 1927: 559) We call a relation “Dedekindian” when it is such that every class has either a maximum or a sequent with respect to it. (PM Vol. II, “Summary of ∗214”, 1912: 684 or 1927: 659) This is the standard definition that every segment with an upper bound has a least upper bound. That least upper bound will either be the maximum of the set or the least individual greater than all members of the set.
