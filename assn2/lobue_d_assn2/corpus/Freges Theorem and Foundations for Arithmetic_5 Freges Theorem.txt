 Frege’s Theorem is that the five Dedekind/Peano axioms for number theory can be derived from Hume’s Principle in second-order logic. In this section, we reconstruct the proof of this theorem; it can be extracted from Frege’s work using the definitions and theorems assembled so far. Some of the steps in this proof can be found in Gl. (See the Appendix to Boolos 1990 for a reconstruction.) Our reconstruction follows Frege’s Gg in spirit and in most details, but we have tried to simplify the presentation in several places. For a stricter description of Frege’s Gg proof, the reader is referred to Heck 1993. The following should help prepare the reader for Heck’s excellent essay. The statement that zero is a natural number is an immediate consequence of the definition of natural number: Theorem 1:  \(N0\) Proof: It is a simple consequence of the definition of ‘weak ancestral’ that \(R^{+}\) is reflexive (see Fact 4 about \(R^{+}\) in our subsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4). So \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,0)\). Hence, by the definition of natural number, \(0\) is a natural number. It seems that Frege never actually identified this fact explicitly in Gl or labeled this fact as a numbered Theorem in Gg I. It is also a simple consequence of the foregoing that 0 doesn’t succeed any natural number. This can be represented formally as follows: Theorem 2:  \(\neg\exists x(Nx \amp \mathit{Precedes}(x,0))\) Proof: Assume, for reductio, that some number, say \(n\), is such that \(\mathit{Precedes}(n,0)\). Then, by the definition of predecessor, it follows that there is a concept, say \(Q\) and an object, say \(c\), such that \(Qc \amp 0\eqclose \#Q \amp n\eqclose \#[\lambda z\, Qz \amp z\neq c]\). But by the Lemma Concerning Zero (above), \(0 = \#Q\) implies \(\neg\exists xQx\), which contradicts the fact that \(Qc\). See Gl, §78, Item (6); and Gg I, §109, Theorem 126. The fact that no two natural numbers have the same successor is somewhat more difficult to prove (cf. Gl, §78, Item (5); Gg I, §95, Theorem 89). We may formulate this theorem as follows, with \(m\), \(n\), and \(o\) as restricted variables ranging over the natural numbers: Theorem 3:  \(\forall m\forall n\forall o[\mathit{Precedes}(m,o)\amp \mathit{Precedes}(n,o) \to m = n]\) In other words, this theorem asserts that predecessor is a one-to-one relation on the natural numbers. To prove this theorem, it suffices to prove that predecessor is a one-to-one relation full stop. One can prove that predecessor is one-to-one from Hume’s Principle, with the help of the following Equinumerosity Lemma, the proof of which is rather long and involved. The Equinumerosity Lemma asserts that when \(F\) and \(G\) are equinumerous, \(x\) falls under \(F\), and \( y\) falls under \(G\), then the concept object falling under F other than x is equinumerous to the concept object falling under G other than \(y\). The picture is something like this: Figure 3 In terms of Figure 3, the Equinumerosity Lemma tells us that if there is a relation \(R\) which is a witness to the equinumerosity of \( F\) and \(G\), then there is a relation \(R'\) which is a witness to the equinumerosity of the concepts that result when you restrict \( F\) and \(G\) to the objects other than \(x\) and \(y\), respectively. To help us formalize the Equinumerosity Lemma, let \(F^{-x}\) abbreviate the concept \([\lambda z \, Fz \amp z\neq x]\) and let \(G^{-y}\) abbreviate the concept \( [\lambda z \, Gz \amp z \neq y]\). Then we have: Equinumerosity Lemma:  \(F\apprxclose G \amp Fx \amp Gy \to F^{-x}\apprxclose G^{-y}\) (Proof of Equinumerosity Lemma) Now we can prove that Predecessor is a one-to-one relation from this Lemma and Hume’s Principle (cf. Gg I, §108): Predecessor is One-to-One:  \(\forall x\forall y\forall z[\mathit{Precedes}(x,z) \amp \mathit{Precedes}(y,z) \to x\eqclose y] \) Proof: Assume that both a and b are precedessors of \(c\). By the definition of predecessor, we know that there are concepts and objects \(P\), \(Q\), \(d\), and \(e\), such that: But if both \(c = \#P\) and \(c = \#Q\), then \(\#P = \#Q\). So, by Hume’s Principle, \(P \approx Q\). So, by the Equinumerosity Lemma, it follows that \(P^{-d} \approx Q^{-e}\). If so, then by Hume’s Principle, \(\#P^{-d} = \#Q^{-e}\). But then, \(a = b\). So, if Predecessor is a one-to-one relation, it is a one-to-one relation on the natural numbers. Therefore, no two numbers have the same successor. This completes the proof of Theorem 3. It is important to mention here that not only is Predecessor a one-to-one relation, it is also a functional relation: Predecessor is a Functional Relation:  \(\forall x\forall y\forall z[\mathit{Precedes}(x,y)\amp \mathit{Precedes}(x,z)\to y\eqclose z]\) This fact can be proved with the help of a kind of converse to the Equinumerosity Lemma: Equinumerosity Lemma ‘Converse’:  \(F^{-x}\apprxclose G^{-y} \amp Fx \amp Gy \towide F\apprxclose G\) We leave the proof of the Equinumerosity Lemma ‘Converse’ and the proof of Predecessor is a Functional Relation as exercises for the reader. Let us say that a concept \(F\) is hereditary on the natural numbers just in case every ‘adjacent’ pair of numbers \(n\) and \(m\) (\(n\) preceding \(m\)) is such that \(m\) falls under \(F\) whenever \(n\) falls under \(F\), i.e., \(\mathit{HerOn}(F,N) \eqabbr \forall n\forall m[\mathit{Precedes}(n,m)\to (Fn \to Fm)]\) Then we may state the Principle of Mathematical Induction as follows: if (a) \(0\) falls under \(F\) and (b) \(F\) is hereditary on the natural numbers, then every natural number falls under \(F\). In formal terms: Theorem 4: Principle of Mathematical Induction:  \(F0 \amp \mathit{HerOn}(F,N) \to \forall n Fn\) Frege actually proves the Principle of Mathematical Induction from a more general principle that governs any \(R\)-series whatsoever. We will call the latter the General Principle of Induction. It asserts that whenever a falls under \(F\), and \(F\) is hereditary on the \(R\)-series beginning with \(a\), then every member of that \(R\)-series falls under \(F\). We can formalize the General Principle of Induction with the help of a strict understanding of ‘hereditary on the \(R\)-series beginning with \(a\)’. Here is a definition: In other words, \(F\) is hereditary on the members of the \(R\)-series beginning with \(a\) just in case every adjacent pair \(x\) and \(y\) in this series (with \(x\) bearing \(R\) to \(y\)) is such that \(y\) falls under \(F\) whenever \(x\) falls under \(F\). Now given this definition, we can reformulate the General Principle of Induction more strictly as: General Principle of Induction:  \([Fa \amp \mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{a}R^{+})] ~\to~ \forall x[R^{+}(a,x) \to Fx]\) This is a version of Frege’s Theorem 152 in Gg I, §117. We may sketch the proof strategy as follows. Assume that the antecedent of the General Principle of Induction holds for an arbitrarily chosen concept, say \(P\). That is, assume: \(Pa \amp \mathit{HerOn}(P, {}^{a}R^{+})\) Now to show \(\forall x(R^{+}(a,x) \to Px)\), pick an arbitrary object, say \(b\), and further assume \(R^{+}(a,b)\). We then simply have to show \(Pb\). We do this by invoking Fact (7) about \(R^{+}\) (in our subsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4). Recall that Fact (7) is: \([Fx \amp R^{+}(x,y) \amp \mathit{Her}(F,R)] \to Fy\) This is a theorem of logic containing the free variables \(x\), \(y\), and \(F\). First, we instantiate \(x\) and \(y\) to \(a\) and \(b\), respectively. Then, we instantiate \(F\) to the concept \([\lambda z \, R^{+}(a,z) \amp Pz]\) and apply \(\lambda\)-Conversion (though Frege could simply use his Rule of Substitution to achieve the same inference). The concept being instantiated for \(F\) is the concept member of the R-series beginning with a and which falls under P. The result of instantiating the free variables in Fact (7) and then applying \(\lambda\)-Conversion yields a rather long conditional, with numerous conjuncts in the antecedent and the claim that \(Pb\) in the consequent. Thus, if the antecedent can be established, the proof is done. For those following along with pencil and paper, all of the conjuncts in the antecedent are things we already know, with the exception of the claim that \([\lambda z \, R^{+}(a,z)\amp Pz]\) is hereditary on \(R\). However, this claim can be established straightforwardly from things we know to be true (and, in particular, from facts contained in the antecedent of the Principle we are trying to prove, which we assumed as part of our conditional proof). The reader is encouraged to complete the proof as an exercise. For those who would like to check their work, we give the complete Proof of the General Principle of Induction here: Proof of the General Principle of Induction Now to derive Principle of Mathematical Induction from the General Principle of Induction, we formulate an instance of the latter by setting \(a\) to \(0\) and \(R\) to Precedes: \({[}F0 \amp \mathit{HerOn}(F, {}^{0}\mathit{Precedes}^{+}){]} \towide \forall x{[}\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x) \to Fx{]}\) When we expand the defined notation for \(\mathit{HerOn}\), substitute the notation \(Nx\) and \(Ny\) for \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,x)\) and \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,y)\), respectively, and then employ our restricted quantifiers \(\forall n(\ldots n\ldots)\) and \(\forall m(\ldots m\ldots)\) for the claims of the form \(\forall y(Ny \to \ldots y\ldots)\) and \(\forall x(Nx \to \ldots x\ldots)\), respectively, the result is the Principle of Mathematical Induction (in which the notation \(\mathit{HerOn}(F,N)\) has been eliminated in terms of its definiens). Frege uses the Principle of Mathematical Induction to prove that every natural number has a successor that's a natural number. We may formulate the theorem as follows: Theorem 5:  \(\forall x{[}Nx \to \exists y(Ny \amp \mathit{Precedes}(x,y)){]}\) To reconstruct Frege’s strategy for proving this theorem, recall that the weak ancestral of the Predecessor relation, i.e., \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(x,y)\), can be read as: \(x\) is a member of the predecessor-series ending with \(y\). Frege then considers the concept member of the predecessor-series ending with n, i.e., \([\lambda z \, \mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,n)]\), where \(n\) is a natural number. Frege then shows, by induction, that every natural number \(n\) precedes the number of the concept member of the predecessor-series ending with n. That is, Frege proves that every natural number has a successor by proving the following Lemma on Successorsby induction: Lemma on Successors:  \(\forall n \mathit{Precedes}(n,\#[\lambda z \, \mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,n)])\) This asserts that every natural number \(n\) precedes the number of numbers in the predecessor series ending with \(n\). Frege can establish Theorem 5 by proving the Lemma on Successors and by showing that the successor of a natural number is itself a natural number. To see an intuitive picture of why the Lemma on Successors gives us what we want, we may temporarily regard \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\) as the relation ≤. (One can prove that \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\) has the properties that ≤ has on the natural numbers.) Although we haven’t yet assigned any meaning to the numerals ‘1’ and ‘2’, the following intuitive sequence is driving Frege’s strategy: For example, the third member of this sequence is true because there are 3 natural numbers (0, 1, and 2) that are less than or equal to 2; so the number 2 precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to 2. Frege’s strategy is to show that the general claim, that \(n\) precedes the number of numbers less than or equal to \(n\), holds for every natural number. So, given this intuitive understanding of the Lemma on Successors, Frege has a good strategy for proving that every number has a successor. (For the remainder of this subsection, the reader may wish to continue to think of \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\) in terms of \(\leq\).) Now to prove the Lemma on Successors by induction, we need to reconfigure this Lemma to a form which can be used as the consequent of the Principle of Mathematical Induction; i.e., we need something of the form \(\forall n\, Fn\). We can get the Lemma on Successors into this form by ‘abstracting out’ a concept from the Lemma using the right-to-left direction of \(\lambda\)-Conversion (i.e., \(\lambda\)-Abstraction) to produce the following equivalent statement of the Lemma: \(\forall n [\lambda y \, \mathit{Precedes}(y, \#[\lambda z \, \mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,y)])]n\) The concept ‘abstracted out’ is the following: \([\lambda y\, \mathit{Precedes}(y,\#[\lambda z \, \mathit{Precedes}^{+}(z,y)])]\) This is the concept: being an object \(y\) which precedes the number of the concept: member of the predecessor series ending in \(y\). Let us abbreviate the \(\lambda\)-expression that denotes this concept as ‘\(Q\)’. Our strategy is to instantiate the variable \(F\) in the Principle of Mathematical Induction to \(Q\). The result is therefore something that has been proved and that we therefore know to be true: \(Q0 \amp \mathit{HerOn}(Q,N) \to \forall nQn\) Since the consequent is the reconfigured Lemma on Successors, Frege can prove this Lemma by proving both that \(0\) falls under \(Q\) (cf. Gg I, Theorem 154) and that \(Q\) is hereditary on the natural numbers (cf. Gg I, Theorem 150): Proof that \(0\) falls under \(Q\) Proof that \(Q\) is hereditary on the natural numbers Given this proof of the Lemma on Successors, Theorem 5 is not far away. The Lemma on Successors shows that every number precedes some cardinal number of the form \(\#F\). We still have to show that such successor cardinals are natural numbers. That is, it still remains to be shown that if a number \(n\) precedes something \(y\), then \(y\) is a natural number: Successors of Natural Numbers are Natural Numbers:  \(\forall n\forall y (\mathit{Precedes}(n,y) \to Ny)\) Proof: Suppose that \(\mathit{Precedes}(n,a)\). Then, by definition, since \(n\) is a natural number, \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,n)\). So by Fact (3) about \(R^{+}\) (in the subsection on the Weak Ancestral in §4), it follows that \(\mathit{Precedes}^*(0,a)\), and so by the definition of \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}\), it follows that \(\mathit{Precedes}^{+}(0,a)\); i.e., \(a\) is a natural number. Theorem 5 now follows from the Lemma on Successors and the fact that successors of natural numbers are natural numbers. With the proof of Theorem 5, we have completed the proof of Frege’s Theorem. Before we turn to the last section of this entry, it is worth mentioning the mathematical significance of this theorem. From Frege’s Theorem, one can derive arithmetic. It is an immediate consequence Theorem 5 and the fact that Predecessor is a functional relation that every number has a unique successor. That means we can define the successor function by adding definite descriptions of the form ‘the \(x\) such that \(\phi\)’ to our language: \(n' \eqdef\) the \(x\) such that \(\mathit{Precedes}(n,x)\) We may then define the sequence of natural numbers succeeding \(0\) as follows: Moreover, the recursive definition of addition can now be given: We may also officially define: These definitions constitute the foundations of arithmetic. Frege has thus insightfully derived the basic laws of arithmetic from Hume’s Principle in second-order logic. (Readers interested in how these results are affected when Hume’s Principle is combined with predicative second-order logic should consult Linnebo 2004.)
