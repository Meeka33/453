 The most familiar logics in the modal family are constructed from a weak logic called \(\bK\) (after Saul Kripke). Under the narrow reading, modal logic concerns necessity and possibility. A variety of different systems may be developed for such logics using \(\bK\) as a foundation. The symbols of \(\bK\) include ‘\({\sim}\)’ for ‘not’, ‘\(\rightarrow\)’ for ‘if…then’, and ‘\(\Box\)’ for the modal operator ‘it is necessary that’. (The connectives ‘\(\amp\)’, ‘\(\vee\)’, and ‘\(\leftrightarrow\)’ may be defined from ‘\({\sim}\)’ and ‘\(\rightarrow\)’ as is done in propositional logic.) \(\bK\) results from adding the following to the principles of propositional logic. Necessitation Rule:   If \(A\) is a theorem of \(\bK\), then so is \(\Box A\). Distribution Axiom: \(\Box(A\rightarrow B) \rightarrow  (\Box A\rightarrow \Box B)\). (In these principles we use ‘\(A\)’ and ‘\(B\)’ as metavariables ranging over formulas of the language.) According to the Necessitation Rule, any theorem of logic is necessary. The Distribution Axiom says that if it is necessary that if \(A\) then \(B\), then if necessarily \(A\), then necessarily \(B\). The operator \(\Diamond\) (for ‘possibly’) can be defined from \(\Box\) by letting \(\Diamond A = {\sim}\Box{\sim}A\). In \(\bK\), the operators \(\Box\) and \(\Diamond\) behave very much like the quantifiers \(\forall\) (all) and \(\exists\) (some). For example, the definition of \(\Diamond\) from \(\Box\) mirrors the equivalence of \(\forall xA\) with \({\sim}\exists x{\sim}A\) in predicate logic. Furthermore, \(\Box(A \amp B)\) entails \(\Box A \amp \Box B\) and vice versa; while \(\Box A\vee \Box B\) entails \(\Box (A\vee B)\), but not vice versa. This reflects the patterns exhibited by the universal quantifier: \(\forall x(A \amp B)\) entails \(\forall xA \amp \forall xB\) and vice versa, while \(\forall xA \vee \forall xB\) entails \(\forall x(A \vee B)\) but not vice versa. Similar parallels between \(\Diamond\) and \(\exists\) can be drawn. The basis for this correspondence between the modal operators and the quantifiers will emerge more clearly in the section on  Possible Worlds Semantics. The system \(\bK\) is too weak to provide an adequate account of necessity. The following axiom is not provable in \(\bK\), but it is clearly desirable. \((M)\) claims that whatever is necessary is the case. Notice that \((M)\) would be incorrect were \(\Box\) to be read ‘it ought to be that’, or ‘it was the case that’. So the presence of axiom \((M)\) distinguishes logics for necessity from other logics in the modal family. A basic modal logic \(M\) results from adding \((M)\) to \(\bK\). (Some authors call this system \(\mathbf{T}\).) Many logicians believe that \(M\) is still too weak to correctly formalize the logic of necessity and possibility. They recommend further axioms to govern the iteration, or repetition of modal operators. Here are two of the most famous iteration axioms: \(\mathbf{S4}\) is the system that results from adding (4) to \(M\). Similarly \(\mathbf{S5}\) is \(M\) plus (5). In \(\mathbf{S4}\), the sentence \(\Box \Box A\) is equivalent to \(\Box A\). As a result, any string of boxes may be replaced by a single box, and the same goes for strings of diamonds. This amounts to the idea that iteration of the modal operators is superfluous. Saying that \(A\) is necessarily necessary is considered a uselessly long-winded way of saying that \(A\) is necessary. The system \(\mathbf{S5}\) has even stronger principles for simplifying strings of modal operators. In \(\mathbf{S4}\), a string of operators of the same kind can be replaced for that operator; in \(\mathbf{S5}\), strings containing both boxes and diamonds are equivalent to the last operator in the string. So, for example, saying that it is possible that \(A\) is necessary is the same as saying that \(A\) is necessary. A summary of these features of \(\mathbf{S4}\) and \(\mathbf{S5}\) follows. One could engage in endless argument over the correctness or incorrectness of these and other iteration principles for \(\Box\) and \(\Diamond\). The controversy can be partly resolved by recognizing that the words ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’, have many different uses. So the acceptability of axioms for modal logic depends on which of these uses we have in mind. For this reason, there is no one modal logic, but rather a whole family of systems built around \(M\). The relationship between these systems is diagrammed in  Section 8,  and their application to different uses of ‘necessarily’ and ‘possibly’ can be more deeply understood by studying their possible world semantics in  Section 6. The system \(\mathbf{B}\) (for the logician Brouwer) is formed by adding axiom \((B)\) to \(M\). It is interesting to note that \(\mathbf{S5}\) can be formulated equivalently by adding \((B)\) to \(\mathbf{S4}\). The axiom \((B)\) raises an important point about the interpretation of modal formulas. \((B)\) says that if \(A\) is the case, then \(A\) is necessarily possible. One might argue that \((B)\) should always be adopted in any modal logic, for surely if \(A\) is the case, then it is necessary that \(A\) is possible. However, there is a problem with this claim that can be exposed by noting that \(\Diamond \Box A\rightarrow A\) is provable from \((B)\). So \(\Diamond \Box A\rightarrow A\) should be acceptable if \((B)\) is. However, \(\Diamond \Box A\rightarrow A\) says that if \(A\) is possibly necessary, then \(A\) is the case, and this is far from obvious. Why does \((B)\) seem obvious, while one of the things it entails seems not obvious at all? The answer is that there is a dangerous ambiguity in the English interpretation of \(A\rightarrow \Box \Diamond A\). We often use the expression ‘If \(A\) then necessarily \(B\)’ to express that the conditional ‘if \(A\) then \(B\)’ is necessary. This interpretation corresponds to \(\Box(A\rightarrow B)\). On other occasions, we mean that if \(A\), then \(B\) is necessary: \(A\rightarrow \Box B\). In English, ‘necessarily’ is an adverb, and since adverbs are usually placed near verbs, we have no natural way to indicate whether the modal operator applies to the whole conditional, or to its consequent. For these reasons, there is a tendency to confuse \((B): A\rightarrow \Box \Diamond A\) with \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\). But \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\) is not the same as \((B)\), for \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\) is already a theorem of \(M\), and \((B)\) is not. One must take special care that our positive reaction to \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\) does not infect our evaluation of \((B)\). One simple way to protect ourselves is to formulate \(B\) in an equivalent way using the axiom: \(\Diamond \Box A\rightarrow A\), where these ambiguities of scope do not arise.
