 In ZFC one can develop the Cantorian theory of transfinite (i.e., infinite) ordinal and cardinal numbers. Following the definition given by Von Neumann in the early 1920s, the ordinal numbers, or ordinals, for short, are obtained by starting with the empty set and performing two operations: taking the immediate successor, and passing to the limit. Thus, the first ordinal number is \({\varnothing}\). Given an ordinal \(\alpha\), its immediate successor, denoted by \(\alpha +1\), is the set \(\alpha \cup \{ \alpha \}\). And given a non-empty set \(X\) of ordinals such that for every \(\alpha \in X\) the successor \(\alpha +1\) is also in \(X\), one obtains the limit ordinal \(\bigcup X\). One shows that every ordinal is (strictly) well-ordered by \(\in\), i.e., it is linearly ordered by \(\in\) and there is no infinite \(\in\)-descending sequence. Also, every well-ordered set is isomorphic to a unique ordinal, called its order-type. Note that every ordinal is the set of its predecessors. However, the class \(ON\) of all ordinals is not a set. Otherwise, \(ON\) would be an ordinal greater than all the ordinals, which is impossible. The first infinite ordinal, which is the set of all finite ordinals, is denoted by the Greek letter omega (\(\omega\)). In ZFC, one identifies the finite ordinals with the natural numbers. Thus, \({\varnothing}=0\), \(\{ {\varnothing}\}=1\), \(\{ {\varnothing}, \{ {\varnothing}\}\}=2\), etc., hence \(\omega\) is just the set \(\mathbb{N}\) of natural numbers. One can extend the operations of addition and multiplication of natural numbers to all the ordinals. For example, the ordinal \(\alpha +\beta\) is the order-type of the well-ordering obtained by concatenating a well-ordered set of order-type \(\alpha\) and a well-ordered set of order-type \(\beta\). The sequence of ordinals, well-ordered by \(\in\), starts as follows 0, 1, 2,…, \(n\),…, \(\omega\), \(\omega+1\), \(\omega+2\),…, \(\omega +\omega\),…, \(n\cdot \omega\), …, \(\omega \cdot \omega\),…, \(\omega^n\), …, \(\omega^\omega\), … The ordinals satisfy the principle of transfinite induction: suppose that \(C\) is a class of ordinals such that whenever \(C\) contains all ordinals \(\beta\) smaller than some ordinal \(\alpha\), then \(\alpha\) is also in \(C\). Then the class \(C\) contains all ordinals. Using transfinite induction one can prove in ZFC (and one needs the axiom of Replacement) the important principle of transfinite recursion, which says that, given any definable class-function \(G:V\to V\), one can define a class-function \(F:ON\to V\) such that \(F(\alpha)\) is the value of the function \(G\) applied to the function \(F\) restricted to \(\alpha\). One uses transfinite recursion, for example, in order to define properly the arithmetical operations of addition, product, and exponentiation on the ordinals. Recall that an infinite set is countable if it is bijectable, i.e., it can be put into a one-to-one correspondence, with \(\omega\). All the ordinals displayed above are either finite or countable. But the set of all finite and countable ordinals is also an ordinal, called \(\omega_1\), and is not countable. Similarly, the set of all ordinals that are bijectable with some ordinal less than or equal to \(\omega_1\) is also an ordinal, called \(\omega_2\), and is not bijectable with \(\omega_1\), and so on. A cardinal is an ordinal that is not bijectable with any smaller ordinal. Thus, every finite ordinal is a cardinal, and \(\omega\), \(\omega_1\), \(\omega_2\), etc. are also cardinals. The infinite cardinals are represented by the letter aleph (\(\aleph\)) of the Hebrew alphabet, and their sequence is indexed by the ordinals. It starts like this \(\aleph_0\), \(\aleph_1\), \(\aleph_2\), …, \(\aleph_\omega\), \(\aleph_{\omega +1}\), …, \(\aleph_{\omega +\omega}\), …, \(\aleph_{\omega^2}\), …, \(\aleph_{\omega^\omega}\), …, \(\aleph_{\omega_1}\), …, \(\aleph_{\omega_2}\), … Thus, \(\omega=\aleph_0\), \(\omega_1=\aleph_1\), \(\omega_2=\aleph_2\), etc. For every cardinal there is a bigger one, and the limit of an increasing sequence of cardinals is also a cardinal. Thus, the class of all cardinals is not a set, but a proper class. An infinite cardinal \(\kappa\) is called regular if it is not the union of less than \(\kappa\) smaller cardinals. Thus, \(\aleph_0\) is regular, and so are all infinite successor cardinals, such as \(\aleph_1\). Non-regular infinite cardinals are called singular. The first singular cardinal is \(\aleph_\omega\), as it is the union of countably-many smaller cardinals, namely \(\aleph_\omega =\bigcup_{n<\omega} \aleph_n\). The cofinality of a cardinal \(\kappa\), denoted by \(cf(\kappa)\) is the smallest cardinal \(\lambda\) such that \(\kappa\) is the union of \(\lambda\)-many smaller ordinals. Thus, \(cf(\aleph_\omega)=\aleph_0\). By the AC (in the form of the Well-Ordering Principle), every set \(A\) can be well-ordered, hence it is bijectable with a unique cardinal, called the cardinality of \(A\). Given two cardinals \(\kappa\) and \(\lambda\), the sum \(\kappa +\lambda\) is defined as the cardinality of the set consisting of the union of any two disjoint sets, one of cardinality \(\kappa\) and one of cardinality \(\lambda\). And the product \(\kappa \cdot \lambda\) is defined as the cardinality of the Cartesian product \(\kappa \times \lambda\). The operations of sum and product of infinite cardinals are trivial, for if \(\kappa\) and \(\lambda\) are infinite cardinals, then \(\kappa +\lambda =\kappa \cdot \lambda = maximum \{ \kappa ,\lambda\}\). In contrast, cardinal exponentiation is highly non-trivial, for even the value of the simplest non-trivial infinite exponential, namely \(2^{\aleph_0}\), is not known and cannot be determined in ZFC (see below). The cardinal \(\kappa^\lambda\) is defined as the cardinality of the Cartesian product of \(\lambda\) copies of \(\kappa\); equivalently, as the cardinality of the set of all functions from \(\lambda\) into \(\kappa\). König’s theorem asserts that \(\kappa^{cf(\kappa)}>\kappa\), which implies that the cofinality of the cardinal \(2^{\aleph_0}\), whatever that cardinal is, must be uncountable. But this is essentially all that ZFC can prove about the value of the exponential \(2^{\aleph_0}\). In the case of exponentiation of singular cardinals, ZFC has a lot more to say. In 1989, Shelah proved the remarkable result that if \(\aleph_\omega\) is a strong limit, that is, \(2^{\aleph_n}<\aleph_\omega\), for every \(n<\omega\), then \(2^{\aleph_\omega}<\aleph_{\omega_4}\) (see Shelah (1994)). The technique developed by Shelah to prove this and similar theorems, in ZFC, is called pcf theory (for possible cofinalities), and has found many applications in other areas of mathematics.
