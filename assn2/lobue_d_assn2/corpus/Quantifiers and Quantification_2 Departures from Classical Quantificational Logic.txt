 In what follows, we look at three rival accounts of quantification in modern logic. They are departures from classical quantification logic because they reject some of classical axioms of quantification or because they question some aspect of the Tarskian model theory we have used to interpret the language of classical quantification logic. In pure quantificational logic, one may, for example, derive the conditional \(\forall x \ Px \rightarrow \exists x \ Px\) as an immediate consequence of the axioms. But the derivability of this sentence—and others like \(\exists x (Px \rightarrow Px)\)—may give one pause. To the extent to which logic should remain neutral in ontological matters, the axioms of pure quantificational logic should not by themselves be able to prove that there is something rather than nothing. From a model-theoretic perspective, the exclusion of the empty domain as an eligible domain for a model may likewise seem artificial. Since the validity of formulas like \(\forall x \ Px \rightarrow \exists x Px\) or \(\exists x (Px \rightarrow Px)\) is largely a byproduct of what may seem an ad hoc stipulation, one may be motivated to expand the range of model-theoretic interpretations in order to allow for a model with an empty domain of discourse. Quine (1954) used the label “inclusive” to refer to alternatives to quantificational logic that make allowance for such a model. According to Quine (1954), an inclusive quantificational logic should evaluate every universally quantified formula of the form \(\forall x \ A\) to be vacuously true in a model \(\langle D, I\rangle\) in which \(D\) is empty, and it should evaluate every existentially quantified formula of the form \(\exists x \ A\) to be false in such a model. \(\forall x \ Px \rightarrow \exists x \ Px\) and \(\exists x (Px \rightarrow Px)\) are therefore not valid on the expanded model theory. However, it is quite a delicate matter to provide a compositional amendment of the Tarskian definition of truth in a model \(\langle D, I \rangle\) under an assignment \(s\) that delivers Quine’s  verdicts.[7] An axiomatization of inclusive quantificational logic should weaken the axiom of universal instantiation in order to prevent the derivation of theorems such as \((\forall x \ Px \rightarrow \exists x \ Px)\) or \(\exists x (Px \rightarrow Px)\). One option independently explored by Kripke (1963) and Lambert (1963) is to replace (\(\forall 1\)) with a closed axiom schema: In the absence of identity, by itself, this change results in an inadequate axiomatization of pure quantificational logic, one which cannot yield every instance of a permutation principle discussed by Fine (1983): The permutation principle, however, becomes redundant in the presence of axioms for identity. The axiomatization of classical quantification logic with identity that emerges from the substitution is discussed by Lambert (1963) with a different motivation in mind: Lambert wanted to allow for alternatives to the classical theory of quantification and identity that remain “free” from any assumptions concerning the existence of denotations for its singular terms and predicates. This motivation has given rise to a variety of alternatives to the classical theory of quantification and identity that are generally subsumed under the label free logic. Some free logics qualify as inclusive quantificational logics, but not all do. To the extent to which the motivations are different, such differences are only to be expected. The entry on  free logic  discusses a variety of options for free logic. Intuitionistic propositional logic is weaker than classical propositional logic. All intuitionistically valid formulas are classically valid, but classically valid formulas like \((A \vee \lnot A)\) and \((\lnot \lnot A \rightarrow A)\) are not intuitionistically  valid.[8]  The exclusion of these formulas from the range of intuitionistic theorems can be motivated by the usual Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of the connectives: Despite the differences in interpretation, there is an important connection between intuitionistic and classical propositional logic. For we know that a formula \(A\) is a theorem of classical propositional logic if, and only if, \(\neg \neg A\) is a theorem of intuitionistic propositional logic. Thus while \((A \vee \neg A)\) is obviously not a theorem of intuitionistic propositional logic, \(\neg \neg (A \vee \neg A)\) is in fact intuitionistically provable. This fact is at the core of a familiar translation from classical into intuitionistic propositional logic due to Kurt Gödel and Gerhard Gentzen. For a summary of this and related facts, the reader may consult the entry on  intuitionistic logic. Now, intuitionistic quantificational logic may be motivated by the Brouwer-Heyting-Kolmogorov interpretation of the quantifiers: The intuitionistic interpretation does not sanction the classical equivalence between \(\exists x \ A\) and \(\neg \forall x \neg \ A\). Indeed, the two quantifiers must remain part of the primitive vocabulary of intuitionistic quantificational logic. The intuitionistic axioms of quantification include counterparts of the classical axioms of universal instantiation and existential generalization: In addition to this, we require counterparts of the classical (\(\forall^{I}2\)) for each quantifier: We have a rule of universal generalization: It is not generally true that a formula \(A\) is a theorem of pure quantificational logic if, and only if, \(\neg \neg A\) is a theorem of intuitionistic quantificational logic, but there is a more sophisticated double-negation interpretation of theorems of pure quantificational logic. In particular, we have that a formula \(A\) is a theorem of quantificational logic if, and only if, it is a theorem of intuitionistic quantificational logic supplemented with a double negation schema: Much like in the propositional case, this fact may be exploited to give a more sophisticated translation from pure quantificational logic into intuitionistic quantificational logic. Details are given in Moschovakis (2010). In intuitionistic quantificational logic, we cannot move from \(\neg \forall x \neg A\) to \(\exists x \ A\), but we still have this: Moreover, since \(A\) intuitionistically entails \(\lnot \lnot A\), we can infer: In intuitionistic quantificational logic, \(\forall x \lnot \lnot A\) is strictly weaker than \(\lnot \lnot \forall x A\), since we have: A variety of interpretations have been advanced for intuitionistic quantificational logic, but the model theory developed by Kripke (1965) is perhaps the most similar to the model theory of classical quantificational logic. A Kripke model \(\mathcal{K}\) is based on a frame \(\langle S, \preceq \rangle\), which consists of a set of stages partially ordered by an accessibility relation \(\preceq\). A Kripke model assigns an inhabited domain, \(D_{s}\), to each stage \(s \in S\), subject to the constraint that \(D_s \subseteq D_{s'}\) when \(s \preceq s'\). We may assume that suitable names for the members of each \(D_s\) have been adjoined to the language. Finally, for \(n>0\), a Kripke model assigns a set of \(n\)-tuples of members of \(D_s\) for each \(n\)-place predicate \(P^{n}\) at each stage \(s\) in \(S\), subject to the constraint that if \(s \preceq s'\) and \(P^n\) is true of \(\langle d_1, \ldots, d_n \rangle\) at \(s\), then \(P^{n}\) is still true of \(\langle d_1, \ldots, d_n \rangle\) at \(s'\). The entry on  intuitionistic logic  provides a more formal and complete statement of Kripke’s model theory for intuitionistic quantificational logic and states Soundness and Completeness Theorems for it. Very roughly, a negation \(\neg A\) is true at a stage \(s\) if, and only if, \(A\) is not true at any stage \(s'\) such that \(s \preceq s'\); an existentially quantified formula \(\exists x \ A\) is true at a stage \(s\) if, and only if, \(A\) is true of some \(d\) in \(D_s\) at \(s\); and a formula \(\forall x \ A\) is true at a stage \(s\) if, and only if, \(A\) is true of every \(d\) in \(D_{s'}\) for every \(s'\) such that \(s \preceq s'\). For a taste of what Kripke models can do, consider: \(\neg \forall x \neg \ A \rightarrow \exists x \ A\) \(\lnot \lnot \forall x \ A \rightarrow \forall x \ A\) \(\forall x \lnot \lnot A \rightarrow \lnot \lnot \forall x \ A\) Let \(\mathcal{K}\) be a Kripke model based on a frame in which we have two stages \(s_0 \preceq s_1\). Assume \(\{d \}\) is the domain associated to each stage by the model, and let a monadic predicate \(P\) be true of \(d\) at \(s_1\) but not at \(s_0\). We may verify that \(\neg \forall x \neg Px\) is true at \(s_0\), even though \(\exists x \ Px\) is not true at \(s_0\). So, (i) is not intuitionistically valid. One may likewise verify that \(\lnot \lnot \forall x Px\) is true at \(s_0\), even though \(\forall x Px\) is not true at \(s_0\). It follows that (ii) is not intuitionistically valid either. For (iii), consider, for example, a Kripke model based on a frame in which we have an infinite number of stages \(s_0 \preceq s_1 \preceq \ldots \preceq s_n \preceq \ldots\). We may assume that \(D_{s_{n}} = \{ d_0 , \ldots, d_n \}\) and that a monadic predicate \(P\) is true at \(s_n\) of every \(d_m\) in the domain except for \(d_n\). It turns out that \(\forall x \lnot \lnot Px\) is true at \(s_0\) even though \(\lnot \lnot \forall x Px\) is not true at \(s_0\). Therefore, \(\forall x \lnot \lnot A \rightarrow \lnot \lnot \forall x A\) is not intuitionistically valid either. These and similar examples are discussed in Burgess 2009. The model-theoretic interpretation of the language of quantificational logic relied on the Tarskian definition of satisfaction in a model by an assignment of values to the variables. But the assignment of an object to a variable is never dependent on the availability of a term, \(t\), for the object in the language for which one defines truth in a model. Indeed, an existentially quantified formula \(\exists x \ A\) may well be true in a model even if no atomic formula of the form \(A(t/y)\) is true in the model. Substitutional quantifiers \(\Pi \alpha \ A\) and \(\Sigma \alpha \ A\) are interpreted differently. An interpretation associates with them not a domain of quantification, but rather a substitution class, \(C\), of linguistic expressions of an appropriate syntactic category in the initial language. The truth conditions for substitutionally quantified sentences of the form \(\Sigma \alpha \ A\) and \(\Pi \alpha \ A\) may be given in terms of the truth conditions of suitable substitution instances of \(A(\epsilon / \alpha)\) in which each occurrence of the substitutional variable \(\alpha\) has been replaced with a linguistic expression, \(\epsilon\), of the appropriate syntactic category in the substitution class for the quantifier: This characterization of substitutional quantification allows for substitutional variables of different syntactic categories, whether singular terms, predicates or sentences. Indeed, substitutional quantification is often used to mimic quantification into predicate and sentence position of the kinds discussed later in this entry. Early work on substitutional quantification was developed in Marcus (1961) but it soon became the subject of debate in the next two decades as philosophers made use of substitutional quantification in ontology and the philosophy of language and mathematics. Belnap and Dunn (1968), Parsons (1971), and Kripke (1976) are some of the relevant papers in the debate. For a sense of some of the purported applications of substitutional quantification, the reader may consult the essays collected in Gottlieb 1981. For additional discussion, see Hand (2007). Let us momentarily focus on singular terms. To keep matters simple, consider an impoverished fragment of the language of arithmetic with one constant, \(0\), read: “zero” and one functional symbol, \(S\), read: “the successor of”. The domain of the intended interpretation consists of a set of natural numbers, which are named by singular terms of the form \(0\), \(SS0\), \(SSS0\), …, etc. If we now associate the class of all such terms to the substitutional quantifiers \(\Sigma \alpha\) and \(\Pi \alpha\), then a sentence like \(\Sigma \alpha \ \alpha = \alpha\) is evaluated as true in virtue of the truth of formulas like \(0 = 0\), whereas \(\Pi \alpha \ \alpha < \alpha\) is evaluated as false in virtue of falsity of formulas like \(0 < 0\). In general, a sentence of the form \(\Sigma \alpha \ A\) exhibits the same truth conditions as an infinitary disjunction of the   form: \[A(0/\alpha) \vee A(S0/\alpha) \vee \ldots\vee A(SS \overbrace{\ldots}^n S0/\alpha) \vee \ldots\] whereas a sentence of   the form \(\Pi \alpha \ A\) exhibits the same truth conditions as an   infinitary conjunction: \[A(0/\alpha) \wedge A(S0/\alpha) \wedge \ldots\wedge A(SS \overbrace{\ldots}^n S0/\alpha) \wedge \ldots\] The   case of arithmetic is optimal because we have a name for each member of the intended domain. This means that in general, a quantified sentence of the form \(\exists x \ A\) will be true if, and only if its substitutional counterpart \(\Sigma \alpha \ A\) is likewise true. But in this respect, however, the language of arithmetic is the exception and not the rule. In real analysis, for example, there are too many objects in the domain to have a name in a countable language. In such a situation, we must confront the risk that a sentence of the form \(\exists x \ A\) may be true even if \(\Sigma \alpha \ A\) remains false in virtue of the lack of a true substitution instance of the form \(A(t/ \alpha)\). This may happen, for example, if the objects that satisfy the open formula \(A\) are not denoted by any singular term in the language. Call the initial language “the object language”. And call the language in which we explain the truth conditions of sentences of the initial language “the metalanguage”. In the metalanguage, we have explained the truth condition for \(\Sigma \alpha \ A\) in terms of what looks like objectual quantification over linguistic expressions. To acknowledge this is of course not to claim that the intended interpretation of substitutional quantification is one on which it is merely objectual quantification over linguistic expressions. But just what the intended interpretation of the substitutional quantifier might be has been the subject of intense controversy. Indeed, van Inwagen (1981) and Fine (1989), for example, have each argued that there is no separate intended interpretation we can understand independently from our grasp of objectual quantification over linguistic expressions of the relevant sort. Whatever the philosophical import of substitutional quantification, Kripke (1976) makes plain that there is no technical obstacle to introducing substitutional quantifiers into a given language. In what is perhaps the canonical treatment of substitutional quantification, he explained how to extend an interpreted language \(\mathcal{L}\) into a substitutional language \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) equipped with substitutional quantification over a class of expressions in \(\mathcal{L}\). One first expands the vocabulary of \(\mathcal{L}\) with an infinite stock of variables \(\alpha_1\), \(\alpha_2\), … and a substitutional quantifier \(\Sigma\). (Kripke defines \(\Pi\) as the dual of \(\Sigma\), where \(\Pi \alpha \ A\) abbreviates: \(\lnot \Sigma \alpha \lnot \ A\).) An atomic preformula is an expression that results from a sentence of \(\mathcal{L}\) when zero or more terms are replaced by a substitutional variable. A form is an atomic preformula, where the replacement of its substitutional variables with terms yields back a sentence. We can now define a formula of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) recursively. \(A\) is a formula of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) if and only if either (i) \(A\) is a form of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) or (ii) \(A\) is \(\lnot B\), where \(B\) is a formula of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) or (iii) \(A\) is \((B \rightarrow C)\), where \(B\) and \(C\) are each formulas of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) or (iv) \(A\) is \(\Sigma \alpha \ B\), where \(B\) is a formula of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\). A sentence of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) is a formula without free substitutional variables. Kripke defines truth for sentences of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) recursively in terms of truth in \(\mathcal{L}\). If \(A\) is an atomic sentence of \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\)—which may well be a complex sentence of \(\mathcal{L}\), then \(A\) is true in \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) if, and only if, \(A\) is true in \(\mathcal{L}\). If \(A\) is a sentence of the form \(\lnot B\), then \(A\) is true in \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) if, and only if, \(B\) is not true in \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\). If \(A\) is of the form \((B \rightarrow C)\), then \(A\) is true in \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) if, and only if, \(B\) is not true or \(C\) is true in \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\). Finally, and more crucially, if \(A\) is of the form \(\Sigma \alpha \ B\), then \(A\) is true in \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) if and only if \(B(\epsilon/\alpha)\) is true in \(\mathcal{L}^{\Sigma}\) for some \(\epsilon\) in the substitution class \(C\) associated with \(\Sigma\). Kripke then defines a sentence \(A\) of the language of pure substitutional quantificational logic to be valid if, and only if \(A\) comes out true no matter what base language \(\mathcal{L}\) and non-empty class of terms \(\mathcal{C}\) we take as input for the substitutional expansion and what predicates of \(\mathcal{L}\) we substitute for the predicates of \(A\). In particular, Kripke notes that when the quantifiers of a valid sentence of pure quantificational logic are suitably rewritten as substitutional quantifiers, we obtain a valid sentence in the language of pure substitutional quantificational logic.
