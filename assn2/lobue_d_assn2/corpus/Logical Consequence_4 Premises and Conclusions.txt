 There has also been dissent, even in Aristotle’s day, as to the “shape” of logical consequence. In particular, there is no settled consensus on the number of premises or conclusions appropriate to “tie together” the consequence relation. In Aristotle’s syllogistic, a syllogism relates two or more premises and a single conclusion. In fact, Aristotle focuses on arguments with exactly two premises (the major premise and the minor premise), but nothing in his definition forbids arguments with three or more premises. Surely, such arguments should be permitted: if, for example, we have one syllogism from two premises \(A\) and \(B\) to a conclusion \(C\), and we have another from the premises \(C\) and \(D\) to the conclusion \(E\), then in some sense, the longer argument from premises \(A, B\) and \(D\) to conclusion \(E\) is a good one. It is found by chaining together the two smaller arguments. If the two original arguments are formally valid, then so too is the longer argument from three premises. On the other hand, on a common reading of Aristotle’s definition of syllogism, one-premise arguments are ruled out—but this seems arbitrary, as even Aristotle’s own “conversion” inferences are thus excluded. For such reasons, many have taken the relation of logical consequence to pair an arbitrary (possibly infinite) collection of premises with a single conclusion. This account has the added virtue of having the special case of an empty collection of premises. Arguments to a conclusion from no premises whatsoever are those in which the conclusion is true by logic alone. Such “conclusions” are logical truths (sometimes tautologies) or, on the proof-centered approach, theorems. Perhaps there is a reason to allow the notion of logical consequence to apply even more broadly. In Gentzen’s proof theory for classical logic, a notion of consequence is defined to hold between multiple premises and multiple conclusions. The argument from a set \(X\) of premises to a set \(Y\) of conclusions is valid if the truth of every member of \(X\) guarantees (in the relevant sense) the truth of some member of \(Y\). There is no doubt that this is formally perspicuous, but the philosophical applicability of the multiple premise—multiple conclusion sense of logical consequence remains an open philosophical issue. In particular, those anti-Realists who take logical consequence to be defined in terms of proof (such as Michael Dummett) reject a multiple conclusion analysis of logical consequence. For an Anti-realist, who takes good inference to be characterised by the way warrant is transmitted from premise to conclusion, it seems that a multiple conclusion analysis of logical consequence is out of the question. In a multiple conclusion argument from \(A\) to \(B, C\), any warrant we have for \(A\) does not necessarily transmit to \(B\) or \(C\): the only conclusion we are warranted to draw is the disjunction \(B\) or \(C\), so it seems for an analysis of consequence in terms of warrant we need to understand some logical vocabulary (in this case, disjunction) in order to understand the consequence relation. This is unacceptable if we hope to use logical consequence as a tool to define that logical vocabulary. No such problems appear to arise in a single conclusion setting. (However, see Restall (2005) for a defence of multiple conclusion consequence for Anti-realists; and see Beall (2011) for a defence of certain sub-classical multiple-conclusion logics in the service of non-classical solutions to paradox.) Another line along which the notion has been broadened (or along which some have sought to broaden it) involves recent work on  substructural logic.  The proposal here is that we may consider doing without some of the standard rules governing the way that premises (or conclusions) of an argument may be combined. Structural rules deal with the shape or structure of an argument in the sense of the way that the premises and conclusions are collected together, and not the way that those statements are constructed. The structural rule of weakening for example, states that if an argument from some collection of premises \(X\) to a conclusion \(C\) is valid, then the argument from \(X\) together with another premise \(A\) to the conclusion \(C\) is also valid. This rule has seemed problematic to some (chiefly on the grounds that the extra premise \(A\) need not be used in the derivation of the conclusion \(C\) and hence, that \(C\) does not follow from the premises \(X,A\) in the appropriate sense).  Relevant logics  are designed to respect this thought, and do without the structural rule of weakening. (For the proof-theoretic picture, see Negri and von Plato (2001).) Other structural rules are also a called into question. Another possible application of substructural logic is found in the analysis of paradoxes such as  Curry’s paradox.  A crucial move in the reasoning in Curry’s paradox and other paradoxes like it seems to require the step reducing two applications of an assumption to a single one (which is then discharged). According to some, this step is problematic, and so, they must distinguish an argument from \(A\) to \(B\) and an argument from \(A, A\) to \(B\). The rule of contraction is rejected. In yet other examples, the order in which premises are used is important and an argument from \(A, B\) to \(C\) is to be distinguished from an argument from \(B, A\) to \(C\). (For more details, consult the entry on  substructural logics.)  There is no doubt that the formal systems of substructural logics are elegant and interesting, but the case for the philosophical importance and applicability of substructural logics is not closed.
