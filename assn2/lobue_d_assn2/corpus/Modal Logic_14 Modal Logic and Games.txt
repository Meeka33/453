 The interaction between the theory of games and modal logic is a flourishing new area of research (van der Hoek and Pauly, 2007; van Benthem, 2011, Ch. 10, and 2014). This work has interesting applications to understanding cooperation and competition among agents as information available to them evolves. The Prisoner’s Dilemma illustrates some of the concepts in game theory that can be analyzed using modal logics. Imagine two players that choose to either cooperate or cheat. If both cooperate, they both achieve a reward of 3 points, if they both cheat, they both get nothing, and if one cooperates and the other cheats, the cheater makes off with 5 points and the cooperator gets nothing. If both players are altruistic and motivated to maximize the sum of their rewards, they will both cooperate, as this is the best they can do together. However, they are both tempted to cheat to increase their own reward from 3 to 5. On the other hand, if they are rational, they may recognize that if they cheat their opponent threatens to cheat and leave them with nothing. So cooperation is the best one can do given this threat. And if each thinks the other realizes this, they may be motivated to cooperate. An extended (or iterated) version of this game gives the players multiple moves, that is, repeated opportunities to play and collect rewards. If players have information about the history of the moves and their outcomes, new concerns come into play, as success in the game depends on knowing their opponent’s strategy, and determining (for example) when he/she can be trusted not to cheat. In multi-player versions of the game, where players are drawn in pairs from a larger pool at each move, one’s own best strategy may well depend on whether one can recognize one’s opponents and the strategies they have adopted. (See Grim et. al., 1998 for fascinating research on Interated Prisoner’s Dilemmas.) In games like Chess, players take turns making their moves and their opponents can see the moves made. If we adopt the convention that the players in a game take turns making their moves, then the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma is a game with missing information about the state of play – the player with the second turn lacks information about what the other player’s last move was. This illustrates the interest of games with imperfect information. The application of games to logic has a long history. One influential application with important implications for linguistics is Game Theoretic Semantics (GTS) (Hintikka et. al. 1983), where validity is defined by the outcome of a game between two players one trying to verify and the other trying to falsify a given formula. GTS has significantly stronger resources that standard Tarski-style semantics, as it can be used (for example) to explain how meaning evolves in a discourse (a sequence of sentences). However, the work on games and modal logic to be described here is somewhat different. Instead of using games to analyze the semantics of a logic, the modal logics at issue are used to analyze games. The structure of games and their play is very rich, as it involves the nature of the game itself (the allowed moves, and the rewards for the outcomes), the strategies (which are sequences of moves through time), and the flow of information available to the players as the game progresses. Therefore, the development of modal logic for games draws on features found in logics involving concepts like time, agency, preference, goals, knowledge, belief, and cooperation. To provide some hint at this variety, here is a limited description of some of the modal operators that turn up in the analysis of games and some of the things that can be expressed with them. The basic idea in the semantics is that a game consists of a set of players 1, 2, 3, …, and a set of W of game states. For each player i, there is an accessibility relation \(R_i\) understood so that \(sR_i t\) holds for states \(s\) and \(t\) iff when the game has come to state \(s\) player \(i\) has the option of making a move that results in \(t\). This collection of relations defines a tree whose branches define every possible sequence of moves in the game. The semantics also assigns truth-values to atoms that keep track of the payoffs. So, for example in a game like Chess, there could be an atom \(\win_i\) such that \(v(\win_i, s)=T\) iff state s is a win for player \(i\). Model operators \(\Box_i\) and \(\Diamond_i\) for each player i may then be defined as follows. So \(\Box_i A\) \((\Diamond_i A)\) is true in s provided that sentence \(A\) holds true in every (some) state that \(i\) can chose from state \(s\). Given that \(\bot\) is a contradiction (so \({\sim}\bot\) is a tautology), \(\Diamond_i {\sim}\bot\) is true at a state when it is \(i\)’s turn to move. For a two-player game \(\Box_1\bot\) & \(\Box_2\bot\) is true of a state that ends the game, because neither 1 nor 2 can move. \(\Box_1\Diamond_2\)win\(_2\) asserts that player 1 has a loss because whatever 1 does from the present state, 2 can win in the following move. For a more general account of the player’s payoffs, ordering relations \(\leq_i\) can be defined over the states so that \(s\leq_i t\) means that \(i\)’s payoff for \(t\) is at least as good as that for \(s\). Another generalization is to express facts about sequences \(q\) of moves, by introducing operators interpreted by relations \(sR_q t\) indicating that the sequence \(q\) starting from s eventually arrives at \(t\). With these and related resources, it is possible express (for example) that q is \(i\)’s best strategy given the present state. It is crucial to the analysis of games to have a way to express the information available to the players. One way to accomplish this is to borrow ideas from epistemic logic. Here we may introduce an accessibility relation \({\sim}_i\) for each player such that \(s{\sim}_i t\) holds iff \(i\) cannot distinguish between states \(s\) and \(t\). Then knowledge operators \(\rK_i\) for the players can be defined so that \(\rK_i A\) says at \(s\) that \(A\) holds in all worlds that \(i\) can distinguish from \(s\); that is, despite \(i\)’s ignorance about the state of play, he/she can still be confident that \(A\). \(\rK\) operators may be used to say that player 1 is in a position to resign, for he knows that 2 sees she has a win: \(\rK_1 \rK_2\Box_1\Diamond_2\win_2\). Since player’s information varies as the game progresses, it is useful to think of moves of the game as indexed by times, and to introduce operators \(O\) and \(U\) from tense logic for ‘next’ and ‘until’. Then \(K_i OA \rightarrow OK_i A\) expresses that player \(i\) has “perfect recall”, that is, that when \(i\) knows that \(A\) happens next, then at the next moment \(i\) has not forgotten that \(A\) has happened. This illustrates how modal logics for games can reflect cognitive idealizations, and a player’s success (or failure) at living up to them. The technical side of the modal logics for games is challenging. The project of identifying systems of rules that are sound and complete for a language containing a large collection of operators may be guided by past research, but the interactions between the variety of accessibility relations leads to new concerns. Furthermore, the computational complexity of various systems and their fragments is a large landscape largely unexplored. Game theoretic concepts can be applied in a surprising variety of ways – from checking an argument for validity to succeeding in the political arena. So there are strong motivations for formulating logics that can handle games. What is striking about this research is the power one obtains by weaving together logics of time, agency, knowledge, belief, and preference in a unified setting. The lessons learned from that integration have value well beyond what they contribute to understanding games.
