 A theory in second (or first) order logic is said to be categorical if any two of its models are isomorphic. A single sentence (which has a model) is categorical if and only if it characterizes some model up to isomorphism (see  §7.1).  A nice property of a categorical theory \(\Gamma\) is (semantic) completeness: Any sentence \(\phi\) in the language in which the theory is written is decided by \(\Gamma\) in the following sense. Either every model of \(\Gamma\) satisfies \(\phi\) or every model of \(\Gamma\) satisfies \(\neg\phi\). In other words, either \(\phi\) or \(\neg\phi\) is a (semantic) logical consequence of \(\Gamma\). The reason is very simple: \(\Gamma\) has, up to isomorphism, only one model M. Since isomorphism preserves truth in second-order logic, \(\phi\) or \(\neg\phi\) is a (semantic) logical consequence of \(\Gamma\) according to whether \(\phi\) is true in M or false in M. If \(\phi\) is a second-order sentence we defined above \(\Mod(\phi)\) as the class \(\{\mm : \mm\models\phi\}\). If \(\phi\) characterizes \(\mm\) up to isomorphism, then, up to isomorphism, The project of axiomatizing mathematical structures with second-order sentences was so successful in the first quarter of the twentieth century that Carnap even proposed that every mathematical structure is determined, up to isomorphism, by its second-order theory. There are trivial cardinality reasons why this could not possibly hold for all models of size \(2^\omega\) and larger. There are simply not enough second-order theories in comparison with the number of non-isomorphic models. However, the proposal of Carnap is trivially true for finite models, and not entirely unreasonable for countable models. In fact Ajtai (1979) showed that it is consistent with ZFC, provided ZFC itself is consistent, that any two countable structures in a finite vocabulary that satisfy the same second-order sentences are isomorphic. Ajtai showed that it is also consistent with ZFC, provided ZFC itself is consistent, that there are two countable structures in a finite vocabulary that satisfy the same second-order sentences without being isomorphic. Thus Carnap’s conjecture (for countable models) is independent of ZFC. Solovay has made a posting in FOM (2006  Other Internet Resources)  in which he shows that the related statement that every complete second-order sentence \(\theta\) is categorical, is independent of ZFC. There is a strong form of categoricity which holds for Henkin structures in important cases and agrees with the usual concept of categoricity in the case of full Henkin models. It builds on the remarkable ability of second-order logic to express its own categoricity. The isomorphism \((M,R)\cong(M',R')\) of two structures \((M,R)\) and \((M',R')\), where the predicates R and \(R'\) are, say, binary, can be expressed in second-order logic as follows, letting \(\ma=(A,M,M',R,R')\), where A is any set containing \(M\cup M'\), \(M=U^\ma\), \(M'={U'}^\ma\), \(R=P^\ma\) and \(R'=P'^\ma\). Now where \(\isom(U,P,U',P')\) is the sentence This suggests that the categoricity of a sentence \(\theta(P)\) with a binary predicate symbol P can be redefined  equivalently,[18]  letting \(\categ(\theta(P))\) be the sentence as In fact, this is how Tarski defines categoricity in 1956 (page 387). This leads us to define: Definition 15 We say that \(\theta(P)\) is internally categorical if Internal categoricity could also be called provable categoricity. The phrase ‘internal categoricity’ was introduced in the context of arithmetic in Walmsley (2002). It was advocated more generally in Väänänen (2012), with more details in Väänänen and Wang (2015). We refer to Button and Walsh (2016) for a recent discussion on this concept. Note that (\ref{internal}) is stronger than (\ref{redef}) because provable sentences are certainly valid. Owing to the Completeness Theorem we can rewrite (\ref{internal}) as Thus internal categoricity means categoricity not only for ordinary models, i.e., full Henkin models, but categoricity inside an arbitrary Henkin model. Note that categoricity is a meta-theoretical concept as it refers to the semantics of second-order logic. In \(\categ(\theta(P))\) the categoricity of \(\theta(P)\) is written in the language of second-order logic. That is, the categoricity, despite being a meta-theoretical concept, is written in the object language. It can be asked, whether this leads us to a different concept? Be that as it may, when the meaning of \(\categ(\theta(P))\) is uncovered by considering its semantics in the meta-theory, the meaning is the same as the meaning we give to the categoricity of \(\theta(P)\). In the concept of internal categoricity we take advantage of this situation by switching from semantical meaning to proof-theoretic meaning. We insist that \(\categ(\theta(P))\) is (not only valid but even) provable. Proof-theory requires less meta-theory than semantics. We can investigate provability of second-order sentences even in number theory by using numbers to code sentences and proofs, as Gödel did in his proof of the Incompleteness Theorem. Of course, the Completeness Theorem brings us back to the semantics. To verify the categoricity of a second-order sentence one has to go through infinite structures in a way which essentially calls for set theory. The situation with internal categoricity is different. To verify the internal categoricity of a second-order sentence one just has to produce a proof. So there is a dramatic difference. And still internal categoricity is stronger than categoricity. So it would be foolish to establish categoricity if one could establish even internal categoricity. Fortunately, the classical examples of categorical sentences are all internally categorical: Theorem 16 (Väänänen & Wang 2015) The received second-order sentences characterizing the structures \((\oN,<)\) and \((\oR,<,+,\cdot,0,1)\) are internally categorical. The concept of internal categoricity provides a bridge between full semantics and Henkin semantics. It works in the same way in both cases and shows that the full semantics is a limit case of Henkin semantics but does not have a monopoly when it comes to categoricity.
