 The following diagram shows the relationships between the best known modal logics, namely logics that can be formed by adding a selection of the axioms \((D), (M)\), (4), \((B)\) and (5) to \(\bK\). A list of these (and other) axioms along with their corresponding frame conditions can be found below the diagram. Diagram of Modal Logics In this chart, systems are given by the list of their axioms. So, for example \(\mathbf{M4B}\) is the result of adding \((M)\), (4) and \((B)\) to \(\bK\). In boldface, we have indicated traditional names of some systems. When system \(\mathbf{S}\) appears below and/or to the left of \(\mathbf{S}'\) connected by a line, then \(\mathbf{S}'\) is an extension of \(\mathbf{S}\). This means that every argument provable in \(\mathbf{S}\) is provable in \(\mathbf{S}'\), but \(\mathbf{S}\) is weaker than \(\mathbf{S}'\), i.e. not all arguments provable in \(\mathbf{S}'\) are provable in \(\mathbf{S}\). The following list indicates axioms, their names, and the corresponding conditions on the accessibility relation \(R\), for axioms so far discussed in this encyclopedia entry. In the list of conditions on frames, and in the rest of this article, the variables ‘\(w\)’, ‘\(v\)’, ‘\(u\)’, ‘\(x\)’ and the quantifier ‘\(\exists u\)’ are understood to range over \(W\). ‘&’ abbreviates ‘and’ and ‘\(\Rightarrow\)’ abbreviates ‘if…then’. The notion of correspondence between axioms and frame conditions that is at issue here was explained in the previous section. When S is a list of axioms and F(S) is the corresponding set of frame conditions, then S corresponds to F(S) exactly when the system K+S is adequate (sound and complete) for F(S)-validity, that is, an argument is provable in K+S iff it is F(S)-valid. Several stronger notions of correspondence between axioms and frame conditions have emerged in research on modal logic.
