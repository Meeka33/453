 Cardinal numbers are the numbers that can be used to answer the question ‘How many \(\ldots\) are there?’, and Frege discovered that such numbers bear an interesting relationship to the natural numbers. Frege’s insights concerning this relationship trace back to his work in Gl, in which the notion of an extension played very little role. The seminal idea of Gl §46 was the observation that a statement of number (e.g., “There are eight planets”) is an assertion about a concept. To explain this idea, Frege noted that one and the same external phenomenon can be counted in different ways; for example, a certain external phenomenon could be counted as 1 army, 5 divisions, 25 regiments, 200 companies, 600 platoons, or 24,000 people. Each way of counting the external phenomenon corresponds to a manner of its conception. The question “How many are there?” is only properly formulated as the question “How many \(F\)s are there?” where a concept \(F\) is supplied. On Frege’s view, the statements of number which answer such questions (e.g., “There are \(n\) \(F\)s”) tell us something about the concept involved. For example, the statement “There are eight planets in the solar system” tells us that the ordinary concept planet in the solar system falls under the second-level numerical concept being exemplified by eight objects. In Gl, Frege then moves from this realization, in which statements of numbers are analyzed as predicating second-level numerical concepts of first-level concepts, to develop an account of the cardinal and natural numbers as ‘self-subsistent’ objects. He introduces a ‘cardinality operator’ on concepts, namely, ‘the number belonging to the concept \( F\)’, which designates the cardinal number which numbers the objects falling under \(F\). In what follows, we say this more simply as ‘the number of \(F\)s’ and use the simple notation ‘\(\#F\)’. Note that the operator # behaves like the \(\epsilon\) operator – when it is prefixed to a concept name like planet (\(P\)), then \(\#P\) (“the number of planets”) denotes an object; when it is prefixed to a variable like \(F\), then \(\# F\) ranges over the domain of objects (for each concept that \(F\) can take as a value, \(\#F\) denotes an object relative to that concept). Frege offers both an implicit (i.e., contextual) and an explicit definition of this operator in Gl. Both of these definitions require a preliminary definition of when two concepts \(F\) and \(G\) are in one-to-one correspondence or ‘equinumerous’. The notion of equinumerosity plays an important and fundamental role in the development of Frege’s Theorem. After developing the definition of equinumerosity, we then discuss Frege’s implicit and explicit definition of the number of \(F\)s. Only the former is needed for the proof of Frege’s Theorem, however. In order to state the definition of equinumerosity, we shall employ the well-known logical notion ‘there exists a unique \(x\) such that \(\phi\)’. To say that there exists a unique \(x\) such that \(\phi\) is to say: there is some \(x\) such that \(\phi\), and anything \(y\) which is such that \(\phi\) is identical to \(x\). In what follows, we use the notation ‘\(\exists!x\phi\)’ to abbreviate this notion of a formula being uniquely satisfied, and we define it formally as follows (where again, \(\phi^y_x\) is the result of substituting \(y\) for the free occurrences of \(x\) in \(\phi\): \(\exists!x\phi \eqdef \exists x[\phi \amp\forall y(\phi^y_x \to y = x)]\) Now, in terms of this logical notion of unique existence, we can state a definition of equinumerosity that is weaker than the one Frege gives in Gl (§§71, 72) but which nevertheless does the job:[4] In other words, \(F\) and \(G\) are equinumerous just in case there is a relation that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between the \(F\)s and the \(G\)s. If we let ‘\(F \approx G\)’ stand for equinumerosity, then the definition of this notion can be rendered formally as follows: To see that Frege’s definition of equinumerosity works correctly, consider the following two examples. In the first example, we have two concepts, \(F\) and \(G\), that are equinumerous: Figure 1 Although there are several different relations \(R\) which demonstrate the equinumerosity of \(F\) and \(G\), the particular relation used in Figure 1 is: \(R_{1} = [\lambda xy \, (x\eqclose a\amp y\eqclose f) \lor (x\eqclose b \amp y\eqclose g) \lor (x\eqclose c\amp y\eqclose e)]\) It is a simple exercise to show that \(R_{1}\), as defined, is a ‘witness’ to the equinumerosity of \(F\) and \(G\) (according to the definition). In Figure 2, we have two concepts that are not equinumerous: Figure 2 In this example, no relation \(R\) can satisfy the definition of equinumerosity. Given the discussion so far, it seems reasonable to suggest that concepts \(F\) and \(G\) will be equinumerous whenever the number of objects falling under \(F\) is identical to the number of objects falling under \(G\). This suggestion will be codified by Hume’s Principle. However, before discussing this principle, the reader should convince him- or herself of the following four facts: (1) that the material equivalence of two concepts implies their equinumerosity, (2) that equinumerosity is reflexive, (3) that equinumerosity is symmetric, and (4) that equinumerosity is transitive. In formal terms, the following facts are provable: Facts About Equinumerosity:  1. \(\forall x(Fx \equiv Gx) \to F\apprxclose G \)  2. \(F \approx F\)  3. \(F\apprxclose G \to G\apprxclose F\)  4. \(F\apprxclose G \amp G\apprxclose H \to F\apprxclose H\) The proofs of these facts, in each case, require the identification of a relation that is a witness to the relevant equinumerosity claim. In some cases, it is easy to identify the relation in question. In other cases, the reader should be able to ‘construct’ such relations (using \(\lambda\)-notation) by considering the examples described above. Facts (2) – (4) establish that equinumerosity is an ‘equivalence relation’ which divides up the domain of concepts into ‘equivalence classes’ of equinumerous concepts. In Gl, Frege contextually defined ‘the number of \(F\)s’ in terms of the principle now known as Hume’s  Principle:[5] Hume’s Principle:  The number of \(F\)s is identical to the number of \(G\)s if and only if \(F\) and \(G\) are equinumerous. Using our notation ‘\(\#F\)’ to abbreviate ‘the number of \(F\)s’, we may formalize Hume’s Principle as follows: Hume’s Principle:  \(\#F\eqclose \#G \equiv F \approx G\) Hume’s Principle is taken to be a contextual definition of \(\#F\) when the latter is assumed as a primitive notion governed by the principle: the principle doesn't explicitly define ‘\(\#F\)’, but contextually defines it by defining contexts (in this case, identity statements) in which it  occurs.[6]  As we shall see, Hume's Principle is the basic principle upon which Frege forged his development of the theory of natural numbers. In Gl, Frege sketched the derivations of the basic laws of number theory from Hume’s Principle; these sketches were developed into more rigorous proofs in Gg I. We will examine these derivations in the following sections. Once Frege had a contextual definition of \(\#F\), he then defined a cardinal number as any object which is the number of some concept: \(x \textit{ is a cardinal number} \eqdef \exists F(x = \#F)\) This represents the definition that appears in Gl, §72. Notice that Hume’s Principle bears an obvious formal resemblance to Basic Law V. Both are biconditionals asserting the equivalence of an identity among singular terms (the left-side condition) with an equivalence relation on concepts (the right-side condition). Indeed, both correlate concepts with certain objects. In the case of Hume’s Principle, each concept \(F\) is correlated with \(\#F\). However, whereas Basic Law V problematically requires that the correlation between concepts and extensions be one-to-one, Hume’s Principle only requires that the correlation between concepts and numbers be many-to-one. Hume’s Principle often correlates distinct concepts with the same number. For example, the distinct concepts author of Principia Mathematica (‘\([\lambda x \, Axp]\)’) and positive integer between 1 and 4 (‘\([\lambda x \, 1\lt x\lt 4]\)’) are equinumerous (both have two objects falling under them). So \(\#[\lambda x\, Axp]\) = \(\#[\lambda x \, 1\lt x\lt 4]\). Thus, Hume’s Principle, unlike Basic Law V, does not require that the domain of numbers be as large as the domain of concepts. Indeed, several authors have developed models that show Hume’s Principle can be consistently added to second-order logic. See the independent work of Geach (1976, 446–7), Hodes (1984, 138), Burgess (1984) and Hazen (1985). [Note: The remaining two subsections are not strictly necessary for understanding the proof of Frege’s Theorem. They are included here for those who wish to have a more complete understanding of what Frege in fact attempted to do. They presuppose the material in §2. Readers interested in just the positive aspects of Frege’s accomplishments should skip directly to §4.] Before we examine the powerful consequences that Frege derived from Hume’s Principle, it is worth digressing to describe his attempt to define ‘\(\#F\)’ explicitly and to derive Hume’s Principle from Basic Law V. The idea behind this attempt was the realization that if given any concept \(F\), the notion of equinumerosity can be used to define the second-level concept being a concept G that is equinumerous to F. Frege found a way to collect all of the concepts equinumerous to a given concept \(F\) into a single extension. In Gl §68, he informally took this to be an extension consisting of first-order concepts by stipulating that the number of \(F\)s is the extension of the second-level concept: being a first-level concept equinumerous to F. In terms of the example used at the end of the previous subsection, this informal definition identifies the number of the concept author of Principia Mathematica as the extension consisting of all and only those first-level concepts that are equinumerous to this concept; this extension has both \([\lambda x \, Axp]\) and \([\lambda x \, 1\lt x\lt 4]\) as members. Frege in fact identifies the cardinal number 2 with this extension, for it contains all and only those concepts under which two objects fall. Similarly, Frege identifies the cardinal number 0 with the extension consisting of all those first-level concepts under which no object falls; this extension would include such concepts as unicorn, centaur, prime number between 3 and 5, etc. Frege’s insight here inspired Russell to develop a somewhat similar definition in his work, and it is now common to see references to the so-called “Frege-Russell definition of the cardinal numbers” as classes of equinumerous concepts or  sets.[7]  Of course, this explicit definition of ‘the number of \( F\)s’ stands or falls with a coherent conception of ‘extension’. We know that Basic Law V does not offer such a coherent conception. Frege’s derivations of Hume’s Principle were invalidated by the fact that it appeals to the inconsistent Basic Law V. Neverthelss, we briefly describe in this subsection, for interested readers, Frege’s derivations. In Gl, §73, Frege sketches an informal proof of the right-to-left direction of Hume’s Principle using the above informal definition of the number of \(F\)s. The derivation appeals to the fact that a concept \(G\) is a member of the extension of the second-level concept concept equinumerous to F if and only if \(G\) is equinumerous to \(F\). In other words, the proof relies on a kind of higher-order version of the Law of Extensions (described above), the ordinary version of which we know to be a consequence of Basic Law  V.[8]  Here is a reconstruction of Frege’s proof in Gl, §73, extended so as to cover both directions of Hume’s Principle. Reconstruction of the Grundlagen Derivation of Hume’s Principle However, in the development of Gg, Frege didn’t formulate the extensions of second-level concepts. In Gg, extensions do not contain concepts as members but rather objects. So Frege had to find another way to express the explicit definition described in the previous subsection. His technique was to let extensions go proxy for their corresponding concepts. Since a full reconstruction of this technique and the proof of Hume’s Principle in Gg would constitute a digression for the present exposition, we shall describe the details for interested readers in a separate document: Reconstruction of the Grundgesetze ‘Derivation’ of Hume’s Principle Interestingly, Tennant (2004) and May & Wehmeier (forthcoming) point out that in Gg, Frege does not, in actual fact, derive Hume’s Principle as a biconditional. Instead, he derives both directions separately without combining them or indicating that the two directions should be conceived as a biconditional. Finally, as noted on several occasions, the inconsistency in Basic Law V invalidated Frege’s derivation of Hume’s Principle. But Hume’s Principle, in and of itself, is a powerful and consistent principle.
