 The epistemological problems of perception have traditionally centered on the threat of skepticism, in particular, on the “veil of perception” implicated by a well-known metaphysics of perception, which threatens to lead inexorably to skepticism. Although certain metaphysical theories of perception have natural affinities for certain epistemological views, the epistemology and metaphysics tend to be logically independent. Even once our metaphysics is in place, we will need to make difficult decisions about the epistemology. There is a wide variety of direct realist epistemological theories of perception and a number of non-direct-realist epistemologies as well, each boasting certain strengths and facing problems yet to be solved.
