 Truth and falsity are a package deal. It would be hard to imagine  someone having the concept of truth without also having the concept  of falsity. One obvious question to ask the proponent of the  deflationary theory of truth, then, is how the theory is to be  extended to falsity. A natural account of the concept of falsity defines it in terms of  the concept of truth. Thus, someone has the concept of falsehood just in case they accept instances of the schema: A second, and initially slightly different, account of falsity  defines it directly in terms of negation. According to this view,  someone has the concept of falsity just in case they accept instances of the schema: Many deflationists suppose that that (F-prop) and (F-prop*) in fact  implicitly define the same concept of falsity (cf Horwich 1994). The  key idea here is that there seems no reason to distinguish being  true from being the case. If there is no distinction  between being true and being the case, presumably there is also no  distinction between ‘It is not the case that p’  and ‘It is not true that p’. In addition,  however, ‘It is not true that p’ is plausibly  synonymous with ‘the proposition that p is not  true’; and this means that (F-prop) and (F-prop*) are  equivalent. As we will shortly see, this account of falsity, though  certainly a natural one, leaves the deflationary theory open to an  important objection concerning truth-value gaps.
