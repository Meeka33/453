 Two dimensional semantics is a variant of possible world semantics that uses two (or more) kinds of parameters in truth evaluation, rather than possible worlds alone. For example, a logic of indexical expressions, such as ‘I’, ‘here’, ‘now’, and the like, needs to bring in the linguistic context (or context for short). Given a context \(c = \langle s, p, t\rangle\) where \(s\) is the speaker, \(p\) the place, and \(t\) the time of utterance, then ‘I’ refers to \(s\), ‘here’ to \(p\), and ‘now’ to \(t\). So in the context \(c = \langle\)Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/\(2014\rangle\) ‘I am here now’ is T iff Jim Garson is in Houston, at 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/2014. In possible worlds semantics, a sentence’s truth-value depended on the world at which it is evaluated. However, indexicals bring in a second dimension – so we need to generalize again. Kaplan (1989) defines the character of a sentence B to be a function from the set of (linguistic) contexts to the content (or intension) of B, where the content, in turn, is simply the intension of B, that is a function from possible worlds to truth-values. Here, truth evaluation is doubly dependent – on both linguistic contexts and possible worlds. One of Kaplan’s most interesting observations is that some indexical sentences are contingent, but at the same time analytically true. An example is (1). Just from the meaning of the words, you can see that (1) must be true in any context \(c = \langle s, p, t\rangle\). After all, \(c\) counts as a linguistic context just in case \(s\) is a speaker who is at place \(p\) at time \(t\). Therefore (1) is true at \(c\), and that means that the pattern of truth-values (1) has along the context dimension must be all Ts (given the possible world is held fixed). This suggests that the context dimension is apt for tracking analytic knowledge obtained from the mastery of our language. On the other hand, the possible-worlds dimension keeps track of what is necessary. Holding the context fixed, there there are possible worlds where (1) is false. For example, when \(c = \langle\)Jim Garson, Houston, 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/\(2014\rangle\), (1) fails at \(c\) in a possible world where Jim Garson is in Boston at 3:00 P.M. CST on 4/3/2014. It follows that ‘I am here now’ is a contingent analytic truth. Therefore, two-dimensional semantics can handle situations where necessity and analyticity come apart. Another example where bringing in two dimension is useful is in the logic for an open future (Thomason, 1984; Belnap, et al., 2001). Here one employs a temporal structure where many possible future histories extend from a given time. Consider (2). If (2) is contingent, then there is a possible history where the battle occurs the day after the time of evaluation, and another one where it does not occur then. So to evaluate (2) you need to know two things: what is the time t of evaluation, and which of the histories h that run through t is the one to be considered. So a sentence in such a logic is evaluated at a pair \(\langle t, h\rangle\). Another problem resolved by two-dimensional semantics is the interaction between ‘now’ and other temporal expressions like the future tense ‘it will be the case that’. Then it is plausible to think that ‘now’ refers to the time of evaluation. So we would have the following truth condition: However this will not work for sentences like (3). With \(\mathrm{F}\) as the future tense operator, (3) might be translated: (The correct translation cannot be \(\forall x(\text{Now} Lx \rightarrow \mathrm{F}Ux)\), with \(\mathrm{F}\) taking narrow scope, because (3) says there is a future time when all things now living are unknown together, not that each living thing will be unknown in some future time of its own). When the truth conditions for (3)\('\) calculated, using (Now) and the truth condition (\(\mathrm{F}\)) for \(\mathrm{F}\), it turns out that (3)\('\) is true at time \(u\) iff there is a time \(t\) after \(u\) such that everything that is living at \(t\) (not \(u\)!)  is unknown at \(t\). To evaluate (3)\('\) correctly so that it matches what we mean by (3), we must make sure that ‘now’ always refers back to the original time of utterance when ‘now’ lies in the scope of other temporal operators such as F. Therefore we need to keep track of which time is the time of utterance \((u)\) as well as which time is the time of evaluation \((t)\). So our indices take the form of a pair \(\langle u, e\rangle\), where \(u\) is the time of utterance, and \(e\) is the time of evaluation. Then the truth condition (Now) is revised to (2DNow). This has it that the Now\(B\) is true at a time u of utterance and time e of evaluation provided that B is true when u is taken to be the time of evaluation. When the truth conditions for F, \(\forall\), and \(\rightarrow\) are revised in the obvious way (just ignore the u in the pair), (3)\('\) is true at \(\langle u, e\rangle\) provided that there is a time \(e'\) later than e such that everything that is living at \(u\) is unknown at \(e'\). By carrying along a record of what \(u\) is during the truth calculation, we can always fix the value for ‘now’ to the original time of utterance, even when ‘now’ is deeply embedded in other temporal operators. A similar phenomenon arises in modal logics with an actuality operator A (read ‘it is actually the case that’). To properly evaluate (4) we need to keep track of which world is taken to be the actual (or real) world as well as which one is taken to the world of evaluation. The idea of distinguishing different possible world dimensions in semantics has had useful applications in philosophy. For example, Chalmers (1996) has presented arguments from the conceivability of (say) zombies to dualist conclusions in the philosophy of mind. Chalmers (2006) has deployed two-dimensional semantics to help identify an a priori aspect of meaning that would support such conclusions. The idea has also been deployed in the philosophy of language. Kripke (1980) famously argued that ‘Water is H2O’ is a posteriori but nevertheless a necessary truth, for given that water just is H20, the there is no possible world where THAT stuff is (say) a basic element as the Greeks thought. On the other hand, there is a strong intuition that had the real world been somewhat different from what it is, the odorless liquid that falls from the sky as rain, fills our lakes and rivers, etc. might perfectly well have been an element. So in some sense it is conceivable that water is not H20. Two dimensional semantics makes room for these intuitions by providing a separate dimension that tracks a conception of water that lays aside the chemical nature of what water actually is. Such a ‘narrow content’ account of the meaning of ‘water’ can explain how one may display semantical competence in the use of that term and still be ignorant about the chemistry of water (Chalmers, 2002).
