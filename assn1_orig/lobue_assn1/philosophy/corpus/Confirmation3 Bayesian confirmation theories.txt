 Bayes’s theorem is a very central element of the probability calculus (see Joyce 2019). For historical reasons, Bayesian has become a standard label to allude to a range of approaches and positions sharing the common idea that probability (in its modern, mathematical sense) plays a crucial role in rational belief, inference, and behavior. According to Bayesian epistemologists and philosophers of science, (i) rational agents have credences differing in strength, which moreover (ii) satisfy the probability axioms, and can thus be represented in probabilistic form. (In non-Bayesian models (ii) is rejected, but (i) may well be retained: see Huber and Schmidt-Petri 2009, Levi 2008, and Spohn 2012.) Well-known arguments exist in favor of this position (see, e.g., Easwaran 2011a; Pettigrew 2016; Skyrms 1987; Vineberg 2016), although there is no lack of difficulties and criticism (see, e.g., Easwaran 2011b; Hájek 2008; Kelly and Glymour 2004; Norton 2011b). Beyond the core ideas above, however, the theoretical landscape of Bayesianism is quite as hopelessly diverse as it is fertile. Surveys and state of art presentations are already numerous, and ostensibly growing (see, e.g., Good 1971; Joyce 2011; Oaksford and Chater 2007; Sprenger and Hartmann 2020; Weisberg 2015). For the present purposes, attention can be restricted to a classification that is still fairly coarse-grained, and based on just two dimensions or criteria. First, there is a distinction between permissivism and impermissivism (see Meacham 2014 and Kopec and Titelbaum 2016 for this terminology). For permissive Bayesians (often otherwise labelled “subjectivists”), accordance with the probability axioms is the only clear-cut constraint on the credences of a rational agent. In impermissive forms of Bayesianism (often otherwise called “objective”), further constraints are put forward that significantly restrict the range of rational credences, possibly up to one single “right” probability function in any given setting. Second, there are different attitudes towards so-called principle of total evidence (TE) for the credences on which a reasoner relies. TE Bayesians maintain that the relevant credences should be represented by a probability function \(P\) which conveys the totality of what is known to the agent. For non-TE approaches, depending on the circumstances, \(P\) may (or should) be set up so that portions of the evidence available are in fact bracketed. (Unsurprisingly, further subtleties arise as soon as one delves a bit further into the precise meaning and scope of TE; see Fitelson 2008 and Williamson 2002, Chs. 9–10, for important discussions.) Of course, many intermediate positions exist between extreme forms of permissivism and impermissivism so outlined, and more or less the same applies for the TE issue. The above distinctions are surely rough enough, but useful nonetheless. Impermissive TE Bayesianism has served as a received view in early Bayesian philosophy of science (e.g., Carnap 1950/1962). But impermissivism is easily found in combination with non-TE positions, too (see, e.g., Maher 1996). TE permissivism seems a good approximation of De Finetti’s (2008) stance, while non-TE permissivism is arguably close to a standard view nowadays (see, e.g., Howson and Urbach 2006). No more than this will be needed to begin our exploration of Bayesian confirmation theories. Let us posit a set \(\bP\) of probability functions representing possible states of belief about a domain that is described in a finite language \(L\) with \(\bL\) the set of its closed sentences. From now on, unless otherwise specified, whenever considering some \(h, e, k \in \bL\) and \(P \in \bP\), we will invariably rely on the following provisos: (These assumptions are convenient and critical for technical reasons, but not entirely innocent. Festa 1999 and Kuipers 2000, 44 ff., discuss some limiting cases that are left aside here owing to these constraints.) A probabilistic theory of confirmation can be spelled out through the definition of a function \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k): \{\bL^3 \times \bP\} \rightarrow \Re\) representing the degree of confirmation that hypothesis \(h\) receives from evidence \(e\) relative to \(k\) and probability function \(P\). \(C_{P}(h,e\mid k)\) will then have relevant probabilities as its building blocks, according to the following basic postulate of probabilistic confirmation: (P0) Formality  There exists a function \(g\) such that, for any \(h, e, k \in \bL\) and any \(P \in \bP\), \(C_{P}(h,e\mid k) = g[P(h\wedge e\mid k),P(h\mid k),P(e\mid k)]\). Note that the probability distribution over the algebra generated by \(h\) and \(e\), conditional on \(k\), is entirely determined by \(P(h\wedge e\mid k)\), \(P(h\mid k)\) and \(P(e\mid k)\). Hence, (P0) simply states that \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\) depends on that distribution, and nothing else. (The label for this assumption is taken from Tentori, Crupi, and Osherson 2007, 2010.) Hempelian and HD confirmation, as discussed above, are qualitative theories of confirmation. They only tell us whether evidence \(e\) confirms (disconfirms) hypothesis \(h\) given \(k\). However, assessments of the amount of support that some evidence brings to a hypothesis are commonly involved in scientific reasoning, as well as in other domains, if only in the form of comparative judgments such as “hypothesis \(h\) is more strongly confirmed by \(e_{1}\) than by \(e_{2}\)” or “\(e\) confirms \(h_{1}\) to a greater extent than \(h_{2}\)”. Consider, for instance, the following principle, a veritable cornerstone of probabilistic confirmation in all of its variations (see Crupi, Chater, and Tentori 2013 for a list of references): (P1) Final probability  For any \(h,e_{1},e_{2},k \in \bL\) and any \(P \in \bP\), \(C_{P}(h,e_{1}\mid k) \gtreqless C_{P}(h, e_{2}\mid k)\) if and only if \(P(h\mid e_{1} \wedge k) \gtreqless P(h\mid e_{2} \wedge k).\) (P1) is itself a comparative, or ordinal, principle, stating that, for any fixed hypothesis \(h\), the final (or posterior) probability and confirmation always move in the same direction in the light of data, \(e\) (given \(k\)). Interestingly, (P0) and (P1) are already sufficient to single out one traditional class of measures of probabilistic confirmation, if conjoined with the following (see Crupi and Tentori 2016, 656, Schippers 2017, and also Törnebohm 1966, 81): (P2) Local equivalence  For any \(h_{1},h_{2},e,k \in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP\), if \(h_{1}\) and \(h_{2}\) are logically equivalent given \(e\) and \(k\), then \(C_{P}(h_{1},e\mid k) = C_{P}(h_{2}, e\mid k).\) The following can then be shown: Theorem 1  (P0), (P1) and (P2) hold if and only if there exists a strictly increasing function \(f\) such that, for any \(h, e, k \in \bL\) and any \(P \in \bP\), \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k) = f[P(h\mid e\wedge k)]\). Theorem 1 provides a simple axiomatic characterization of the class of confirmation functions that are strictly increasing with the final probability of the hypothesis given the evidence (and \(k\)) (proven in Schippers 2017). All the functions in this class are ordinally equivalent, meaning that they imply the same rank order of \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\) and \(C_{P^*}(h^*,e^*\mid k^*)\) for any \(h, h^*,e, e^*,k, k^* \in \bL\) and any \(P, P^* \in \bP.\) By (P0), (P1) and (P2), we thus have \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k) = f[P(h\mid e \wedge k)]\), implying that the more likely \(h\) is given the evidence the more it is confirmed. This approach explicates confirmation precisely as the overall credibility of a hypothesis (firmness is Carnap’s 1950/1962 telling term, xvi). In this view, “Bayesian confirmation theory is little more than the examination of [the] properties” of the posterior probability function (Howson 2000, 179). As we will see, the ordinal level of analysis is a solid and convenient middleground between a purely qualitative and a thoroughly quantitative (metric) notion of confirmation. To begin with, ordinal notions are in general sufficient to move “upwards” to the qualitative level as follows: Given Theorem 1, (P0), (P1) and (P2) can be combined with the definitions in (QC) to derive the following qualitative notion of probabilistic confirmation as firmness: The point of qualitative \(F\)-confirmation is thus straightforward: \(h\) is said to be (dis)confirmed by \(e\) (given \(k\)) if it is more likely than not to be true (false). (Sometimes a threshold higher than a probability \(\bfrac{1}{2}\) is identified, but this complication would add little for our present purposes.) The ordinal notion of confirmation is of high theoretical significance because ordinal divergences, unlike purely quantitative differences, imply opposite comparative judgments for some evidence-hypothesis pairs. A refinement from the ordinal to a properly quantitative level is also be of interest, however, and much useful for tractability and applications. For example, one can have 0 as a convenient neutrality threshold for confirmation as firmness, provided that the following functional representation is adopted (see Peirce 1878 for an early occurrence): (The base of the logarithm can be chosen at convenience, as long as it is strictly greater than 1.) A quantitative requirement that is often put forward is the following stringent form of additivity: Strict additivity (SA)  For any \(h, e_{1},e_{2},k \in \bL\) and any \(P \in \bP\),   \(\ \ \ C_{P}(h, e_{1} \wedge e_{2}\mid k) = C_{P}(h, e_{1}\mid k) + C_{P}(h, e_{2}\mid e_{1} \wedge k).\) Although extraneous to \(F\)-confirmation, Strict Additivity will prove of use later on for the discussion of further variants of Bayesian confirmation theory. Confirmation as firmness shares a number of structural properties with Hempelian confirmation. It satisfies the Special Consequence Condition, thus the Predictive Inference Condition too. It satisfies the Entailment Condition and, in virtue of (P1), extends it smoothly to the following ordinal counterpart: According to (EC-Ord) not only is classical entailment retained as a case of confirmation, it also represents a limiting case: it is the strongest possible form of confirmation that a fixed hypothesis \(h\) can receive. \(F\)-confirmation also satisfies Confirmation Complementarity and, moreover, extends it to its appealing ordinal counterpart (see Crupi, Festa, and Buttasi 2010, 85–86), that is: Confirmation complementarity (ordinal extension) (CC-Ord)  \(C_{P}(\neg h, e\mid k)\) is a strictly decreasing function of \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\), that is, for any \(h, h^*,e, e^*,k \in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP,\) \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\gtreqless C_{P}(h^*,e^*\mid k)\) if and only if \(C_{P}(\neg h, e\mid k) \lesseqgtr C_{P}(\neg h^*,e^*\mid k).\) (CC-Ord) neatly reflects Keynes’ (1921, 80) remark that “an argument is always as near to proving or disproving a proposition, as it is to disproving or proving its contradictory”. Indeed, quantitatively, the measure \(F(h, e\mid k)\) instantiates Confirmation Complementarity in a simple and elegant way, that is, it satisfies \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k) = -C_{P}(\neg h, e\mid k).\) \(F\)-confirmation also implies another attractive quantitative result, alleviating the ailments of the irrelevant conjunction paradox. In the statement below, indicating this result, the irrelevance of \(q\) for hypothesis \(h\) and evidence \(e\) (relative to \(k\)) is meant to amount to the probabilistic independence of \(q\) from \(h, e\) and their conjunction (given \(k\)), that is, to \(P(h \wedge q\mid k) = P(h\mid k)P(q\mid k),\) \(P(e \wedge q\mid k) = P(e\mid k)P(q\mid k)\), and \(P(h \wedge e \wedge q\mid k) = P(h \wedge e\mid k)P(q\mid k)\), respectively. Confirmation upon irrelevant conjunction (ordinal solution) (CIC)  For any \(h, e, q, k \in \bL\) and any \(P \in \bP,\) if \(e\) confirms \(h\) relative to \(k\) and \(q\) is irrelevant for \(h\) and \(e\) relative to \(k\), then  \(\ \ \ C_{P}(h, e\mid k) \gt C_{P}(h \wedge q, e\mid k).\) So, even in case it is qualitatively preserved across the tacking of \(q\) onto \(h\), the positive confirmation afforded by \(e\) is at least bound to quantitatively decrease thereby. Partly because of appealing formal features such as those mentioned so far, there is a long list of distinguished scholars advocating the firmness view of confirmation, from Keynes (1921) and Hosiasson-Lindenbaum (1940) onwards, most often coupled with some form of impermissive Bayesianism (see Hawthorne 2011 and Williamson 2011 for contemporary variations). In fact, \(F\)-confirmation fits most neatly a classical form of TE impermissivism à la Carnap, where one assumes that \(k = \top,\) that \(P\) is an “objective” initial probability based on essentially logical considerations, and that all the non-logical information available is collected in \(e\). The spirit of the Carnapian project never lost its appeal entirely (see, e.g., Festa 2003, Franklin 2001, Maher 2010, Paris 2011). However, the idea of a “logical” interpretation of \(P\) got stuck into difficulties that are often seen as insurmountable (e.g., Earman and Salmon 1992, 85–89; Gillies 2000, Ch. 3; Hájek 2019; Howson and Urbach 2006, 59–72; van Fraassen 1989, Ch. 12; Zabell 2011). And arguably, lacking some robust and effective impermissivist policy, the account of confirmation as firmness ends up loosing much of its philosophical momentum. The issues surrounding the ravens and blite paradoxes provide a useful illustration. Consider again \(h = \forall x(raven(x) \rightarrow black(x))\), and the main analyses of “the observation that \(a\) is a black raven” encountered so far, that is: In both cases, whether \(e\) \(F\)-confirms \(h\) or not (relative to \(k\)) critically depends on \(P\): if the prior \(P(h\mid k)\) is low enough, \(e\) won’t do no matter what under either (i) or (ii); and if it is high enough, \(h\) will be \(F\)-confirmed either way. As a consequence, the \(F\)-confirmation view, by itself, does not offer any definite hint as to when, how, and why Nicod’s remarks apply or not. For the purposes of our discussion, the following condition reveals another debatable aspect of the firmness explication of confirmation. Consistency condition (Cons)  For any \(h, h^*,e, k \in \bL\) and any \(P \in \bP\), if \(k \vDash \neg(h\wedge h^*)\) then \(e\) confirms \(h\) given \(k\) if and only if \(e\) disconfirms \(h^*\) given \(k\). (Cons) says that evidence \(e\) can never confirm incompatible hypotheses. But consider, by way of illustration, a clinical case of an infectious disease of unknown origin, and suppose that \(e\) is the failure of antibiotic treatment. Arguably, there is nothing wrong in saying that, by discrediting bacteria as possible causes, the evidence confirms (viz. provides some support for) any of a number of alternative viral diagnoses. This judgment clashes with (Cons), though, which then seems an overly strong constraint. Notably, (Cons) was defended by Hempel (1945) and, in fact, one can show that it follows from the conjunction of (qualitative) Confirmation Complementary and the Special Consequence Condition, and so from both Hempelian and \(F\)-confirmation. This is but one sign of how stringent the Special Consequence Condition is. Mainly because of the latter, both the Hempelian and the firmness views of confirmation must depart from the plausible HD idea that hypotheses are generally confirmed by their verified consequences (see Hempel 1945, 103–104). We will come back to this while discussing our next topic: a very different Bayesian explication of confirmation, based on the notion of probabilistic relevance. We’ve seen that the firmness notion of probabilistic confirmation can be singled out through one ordinal constraint, (P2), in addition to the fundamental principles (P0)–(P1). The counterpart condition for the so-called relevance notion of probabilistic confirmation is the following: (P3) Tautological evidence  For any \(h_{1},h_{2},k\in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP\), \(C_{P}(h_{1},\top \mid k) = C_{P}(h_{2},\top \mid k).\) (P3) implies that any hypothesis is equally “confirmed” by empty evidence. We will say that \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\) represents the probabilistic relevance notion of confirmation, or relevance-confirmation, if and only if it satisfies (P0), (P1) and (P3). These conditions are sufficient to derive the following, purely qualitative principle, according to the definitional method in (QC) above (see Crupi and Tentori 2014, 82, and Crupi 2015). The point of relevance confirmation is that the credibility of a hypothesis can be changed in either a positive (confirmation in a strict sense) or negative way (disconfirmation) by the evidence concerned (given \(k\)). Confirmation (in the strict sense) thus reflects an increase from initial to final probability, whereas disconfirmation reflects a decrease (see Achinstein 2005 for some diverging views on this very idea). The qualitative notions of confirmation as firmness and as relevance are demonstrably distinct. Unlike firmness, relevance confirmation can not be formalized by the final probability alone, or any increasing function thereof. To illustrate, the probability of an otherwise very rare disease \((h)\) can be quite low even after a relevant positive test result \((e)\); yet \(h\) is relevance-confirmed by \(e\) to the extent that its probability rises thereby. By the same token, the probability of the absence of the disease \((\neg h)\) can be quite high despite the positive test result \((e)\), yet \(\neg h\) is relevance-disconfirmed by \(e\) to the extent that its probability decreases thereby. Perhaps surprisingly, the distinction between firmness and relevance confirmation—“extremely fundamental” and yet “sometimes unnoticed”, as Salmon (1969, 48–49) put it—had to be stressed time and again to achieve theoretical clarity in philosophy (e.g., Popper 1954; Peijnenburg 2012) as well as in other domains concerned, such as artificial intelligence and the psychology of reasoning (see Horvitz and Heckerman 1986; Crupi, Fitelson, and Tentori 2008; Shogenji 2012). The qualitative notion of relevance confirmation already has some interesting consequences. It implies, for instance, the following remarkable fact: Complementary Evidence (CompE)  For any \(h, e, k\in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP,\) \(e\) confirms \(h\) relative to \(k\) if and only if \(\neg e\) disconfirms \(h\) relative to \(k.\) The importance of (CompE) can be illustrated as follows. Consider the case of a father suspected of abusing his son. Suppose that the child does claim that s/he has been abused (label this evidence \(e\)). A forensic psychiatrist, when consulted, declares that this confirms guilt \((h)\). Alternatively, suppose that the child is asked and does not report having been abused \((\neg e).\) As pointed out by Dawes (2001), it may well happen that a forensic psychiatrist will nonetheless interpret this as evidence confirming guilt (suggesting that violence has prompted the child’s denial). One might want to argue that, other things being equal, this kind of “heads I win, tails you lose” judgment would be inconsistent, and thus in principle untenable. Whoever concurs with this line of argument (as Dawes 2001 himself did) is likely to be relying on the relevance notion of confirmation. In fact, no other notion of confirmation considered so far provides a general foundation for this judgment. \(F\)-confirmation, in particular, would not do, for it does allow that both \(e\) and \(\neg e\) confirm \(h\) (relative to \(k\)). This is because, mathematically, it is perfectly possible for both \(P(h\mid e \wedge k)\) and \(P(h\mid \neg e \wedge k)\) to be arbitrarily high above \(\bfrac{1}{2}.\) Condition (CompE), on the contrary, ensures that only one between the complementary statements \(e\) and \(\neg e\) can confirm hypothesis \(h\) (relative to \(k\)). (To be precise, HD-confirmation also satisfies condition CompE, yet it would fail the above example all the same, although for a different reason, that is, because the connection between \(h\) and \(e\) is plausibly one of probabilistic dependence but not of logical entailment.) Remarks such as the foregoing have induced some contemporary Bayesian theorists to dismiss the notion of confirmation as firmness altogether, concluding with I.J. Good (1968, 134) that “if you had \(P(h\mid e \wedge k)\) close to unity, but less than \(P(h\mid k)\), you ought not to say that \(h\) was confirmed by \(e\)” (also see Salmon 1975, 13). Let us follow this suggestion and proceed to consider the ordinal (and quantitative) notions of relevance confirmation. Just as with firmness, the ordinal analysis of relevance confirmation can be characterized axiomatically. With the relevance notion, however, a larger set of options arises. Consider the following principles. (P4) Disjunction of alternative hypotheses  For any \(e, h_{1},h_{2},k\in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP,\) if \(k\vDash \neg (h_{1} \wedge h_{2})\), then \(C_{P}(h_{1},e\mid k) \gtreqless C_{P}(h_{1} \vee h_{2},e\mid k)\) if and only if \(P(h_{2}\mid e \wedge k)\gtreqless P(h_{2}\mid k).\) (P5) Law of likelihood  For any \(e, h_{1}, h_{2}, k\in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP,\) \(C_{P}(h_{1}, e\mid k)\gtreqless C_{P}(h_{2}, e\mid k)\) if and only if \(P(e\mid h_{1} \wedge k)\gtreqless P(e\mid h_{2} \wedge k).\) (P6) Modularity (for conditionally independent data)  For any \(e_{1},e_{2},h, k\in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP,\) if \(P(e_{1}\mid \pm h \wedge e_{2} \wedge k)=P(e_{1}\mid \pm h \wedge k),\) then \(C_{P}(h, e_{1}\mid e_{2} \wedge k) = C_{P}(h, e_{1}\mid k).\) All the above conditions occur more or less widely in the literature (see Crupi, Chater, and Tentori 2013 and Crupi and Tentori 2016 for references and discussion). Interestingly, they’re all pairwise incompatible on the background of the Formality and the Final Probability principles (P0 and P1 above). Indeed, they sort out the relevance notion of confirmation into three distinct, classical families of measures, as follows (Crupi, Chater, and Tentori 2013; Crupi and Tentori 2016; Heckerman 1988; Sprenger and Hartmann 2020, Ch. 1): If a strictly additive behavior (SA above) is imposed, one functional form is singled out for the quantitative representation of confirmation corresponding to each of the clauses above: (The bases of the logarithms are assumed to be strictly greater than 1.) Before discussing briefly this set of alternative quantitative measures of relevance confirmation, we will address one further related issue. It is a long-standing idea, going back to Carnap at least, that confirmation theory should yield an inductive logic that is analogous to classical deductive logic in some suitable sense, thus providing a theory of partial entailment, and partial refutation. Now, the deductive-logical notions of entailment and refutation (contradiction) exhibit the following well-known properties: Contraposition of entailment  Entailment is contrapositive, but not commutative. That is, it holds that \(e\) entails \(h\) \((e\vDash h)\) if and only if \(\neg h\) entails \(\neg e\) \((\neg h\vDash \neg e),\) while it does not hold that \(e\) entails \(h\) if and only if \(h\) entails \(e\) \((h\vDash e).\) Commutativity of refutation  Refutation, on the contrary, is commutative, but not contrapositive. That is, it holds that \(e\) refutes \(h\) \((e\vDash \neg h)\) if and only if \(h\) refutes \(e\) \((h\vDash \neg e)\), while it does not hold that \(e\) refutes \(h\) if and only if \(\neg h\) refutes \(\neg e\) \((\neg h \vDash \neg\neg e).\) The confirmation-theoretic counterparts are fairly straightforward: (P7) Contraposition of confirmation  For any \(e, h, k\in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP,\) if \(e\) relevance-confirms \(h\) relative to \(k,\) then \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k) = C_{P}(\neg e,\neg h\mid k).\) (P8) Commutativity of disconfirmation  For any \(e, h, k \in \bL\) and any \(P \in \bP,\) if \(e\) relevance-disconfirms \(h\) relative to \(k\), then \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k) = C_{P}(e, h\mid k).\) The following can then be proven (Crupi and Tentori 2013): Theorem 3  Given (P0) and (P1), (P7) and (P8) hold if and only if \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\) is a relative distance measure, that is, if there exists a strictly increasing function \(f\) such that, for any \(h, e, k\in \bL\) and any \(P\in \bP,\) \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k) = f[Z(h, e\mid k)],\) where: \( Z(h,e\mid k)= \begin{cases} \dfrac{P(h\mid e \wedge k) - P(h\mid k)}{1-P(h\mid k)} & \mbox{if } P(h\mid e \wedge k) \ge P(h\mid k) \\ \\ \dfrac{P(h\mid e \wedge k) - P(h\mid k)}{P(h\mid k)} & \mbox{if } P(h\mid e \wedge k) \lt P(h\mid k) \end{cases} \) So, despite some pessimistic suggestions (see, e.g., Hawthorne 2018, and the discussion in Crupi and Tentori 2013), a neat confirmation-theoretic generalization of logical entailment (and refutation) is possible after all. Interestingly, relative distance measures can be additive, but only for uniform pairs of arguments – both confirmatory or both disconfirmatory (see Milne 2014, p. 259). (Note: Crupi, Tentori, and Gonzalez 2007; Crupi, Festa, and Buttasi 2010; and Crupi and Tentori 2013, 2014, provide further discussions of the properties of relative distance measures and their intuitive motivations. Also see Mura 2008 for a related analysis.) The plurality of alternative probabilistic measures of relevance confirmation has prompted some scholars to be skeptical or dismissive of the prospects for a quantitative theory of confirmation (see, e.g., Howson 2000, 184–185, and Kyburg and Teng 2001, 98 ff.). However, as we will see shortly, quantitative analyses of relevance confirmation have proved important for handling a number of puzzles and issues that plagued competing approaches. Moreover, various arguments in the philosophy of science and beyond have been shown to depend critically (and sometimes unwittingly) on the choice of one confirmation measure (or some of them) rather than others (see Festa and Cevolani 2017, Fitelson 1999, Brössel 2013, Glass 2013, Roche and Shogenji 2014, Rusconi et al. 2014, and van Enk 2014). Recently, arguments have been offered by Huber (2008b) in favor of \(D\), by Park (2014), Pruss (2014), and Vassend (2015) in favor of \(L\) (also see Morey, Romeijn, and Rouder 2016 for an important connection with statistics), and by Crupi and Tentori (2010) in favor of \(Z\). Hájek and Joyce (2008, 123), on the other hand, have seen different measures as possibly capturing “distinct, complementary notions of evidential support” (also see Schlosshauer and Wheeler 2011, Sprenger and Hartmann 2020, Ch.1, and Steel 2007 for tempered forms of pluralism). The case of measure \(R\) deserves some more specific comments, however. Following Fitelson (2007), one could see \(R\) as conveying key tenets of so-called “likelihoodist” position about evidential reasoning (see Royall 1997 for a classical statement, and Chandler 2013 and Sober 1990 for consonant arguments and inclinations). There seems to be some consensus, however, that compelling objections can be raised against the adequacy of \(R\) as a proper measure of relevance confirmation (see, in particular, Crupi, Festa, and Buttasi 2010, 85–86; Eells and Fitelson 2002; Gillies 1986, 112; and compare Milne 1996 with Milne 2010, Other Internet Resources). In what follows, too, it will be convenient to restrict our discussion to \(D, L\) and \(Z\) as candidate measures. All the results to be presented below are invariant for whatever choice among these three options, and across ordinal equivalence with each of them (but those results do not always extend to measures ordinally equivalent to \(R\)). Let us go back to a classical HD case, where the (consistent) conjunction \(h \wedge k\) (but not \(k\) alone) entails \(e.\) The following can be proven: Formally, it is fairly simple to show that (SP) characterizes relevance confirmation (see, e.g., Crupi, Festa, and Buttasi 2010, 80; Hájek and Joyce 2008, 123), but the philosophical import of this result is nonetheless remarkable. For illustrative purposes, it is useful to assume the endorsement of the principle of total evidence (TE) as a default position for the Bayesian. This means that \(P\) is assumed to represent actual degrees of belief of a rational agent, that is, given all the background information available. Then, by clause (i) of (SP), we have that the occurrence of \(e\), a consequence of \(h \wedge k\) (but not of \(k\) alone), confirms \(h\) relative to \(k\) provided that \(e\) was initially uncertain to some degree (even given \(k\)). In other words: \(e\) must have been predicted on the basis of \(h \wedge k\). Moreover, again by (i), the confirmatory impact will be stronger the more surprising (unlikely) the evidence was unless \(h\) was conjoined to \(k\). So, under TE, relevance confirmation turns out to embed a squarely predictivist version of hypothetico-deductivism! As we know, this neutralizes the charge of underdetermination, yet it comes at the usual cost, namely, the old evidence problem. In fact, if TE is in force, then clause (ii) of (SP) implies that no statement that is known to be true (thus assigned probability 1) can ever have confirmatory import. Interestingly, the Bayesian predictivist has an escape (neatly anticipated, and criticized, by Glymour 1980a, 91–92). Consider Einstein and Mercury once again. As effectively pointed out by Norton (2011a, 7), Einstein was extremely careful to emphasize that the precession phenomenon had been derived “without having to posit any special [auxiliary] hypotheses at all”. Why? Well, presumably because if one had allowed herself to arbitrarily devise ad hoc auxiliaries (within \(k\), in our notation) then one could have been pretty much certain in advance to find a way to get Mercury’s data right (remember: that’s the lesson of the underdetermination theorem). But getting those data right with auxiliaries \(k\) that were not thus adjusted—that would have been a natural consequence had the theory of general relativity been true and it would have been surprising otherwise. Arguably, this line of argument exploits much of the use-novelty idea within a predictivist framework. The crucial points are (i) that the evidence implied is not a verified empirical statement \(e\) but the logical fact that \(h \wedge k\) entails \(e\), and (ii) that the existence of this connection of entailment was not to be obviously anticipated at all, precisely because \(h \wedge k\) and \(e\) are such that the latter did not serve as a constraint to specify the former. On these conditions, it seems that \(h\) can be confirmed by this kind of “second-order” (logical) evidence in line with (SP) while TE is concurrently preserved. At least two main problems arise, however. The first one is more technical in nature. Modelling rational uncertainty concerning logical facts (such as \(h \wedge k \vDash e\)) by probabilistic means is no trivial task. Garber (1983) put forward an influential proposal, but doubts have been raised that it might not be well-behaved (e.g., van Fraassen 1988; a careful survey with further references can be found in Eva and Hartmann forthcoming). Second, and more substantially, this solution of the old evidence problem can be charged of being an elusive change of the subject: for it was Mercury’s data, not anything else, that had to be recovered as having confirmed (and still confirming, some would add) Einstein’s theory. That’s the kind of judgment that confirmation theory must capture, and which remains unattainable for the predictivist Bayesian. (Earman 1992, 131 voiced this complaint forcefully. Hints for a possible rejoinder appear in Eells’s 1990 thorough discussion; see also Skyrms 1983.) Bayesians that are unconvinced by the predictivist position are naturally led to dismiss TE and allow for the assignment of initial probabilities lower than 1 even to statements that were known all along. Of course, this brings the underdetermination problem back, for now \(k\) can still be concocted ad hoc to have known evidence \(e\) following from \(h \wedge k\) and moreover \(P(e\mid k)\lt 1\) is not prevented by TE anymore, thus potentially licencing arbitrary confirmation relations. Two moves can be combined to handle this problem. First, unlike HD, the Bayesian framework has the formal resources to characterize the auxiliaries themselves as more or less likely and thus their adoption as relatively safe or suspicious (the standard Bayesian treatment of auxiliary hypotheses is developed along these lines in Dorling 1979 and Howson and Urbach 2006, 92–102, and it is critically discussed in Rowbottom 2010, Strevens 2001, and Worrall 1993; also see Christensen 1997 for an important analysis of related issues). Second, one has to provide indications as to how TE should be relaxed. Non-TE Bayesians of the impermissivist strand often suggest that objective likelihood values concerning the outcome \(e\)—\(P(e\mid h \wedge k)\)—can be specified for the competing hypotheses at issue quite apart from the fact that \(e\) may have already occurred. Such values would typically be diverse for different hypotheses (thus mathematically implying \(P(e\mid k)\lt 1\)) and serve as a basis to capture formally the confirmatory impact of \(e\) (see Hawthorne 2005 for an argument along these lines). Permissivists, on the other hand, can not coherently rely on these considerations to articulate a non-TE position. They must invoke counterfactual degrees of belief instead, suggesting that \(P\) should be reconstructed as representing the beliefs that the agent would have, had she not known that \(e\) was true (see Howson 1991 for a statement and discussion, and Sprenger 2015 for an original recent variant; also see Jeffrey 1995 and Wagner 2001 for relevant technical results, and Steele and Werndl 2013 for an intriguing case-study from climate science). The theory of Bayesian confirmation as relevance indicates when and why the HD idea works: if \(h \wedge k\) (but not \(k\)) entails \(e\), then \(h\) is relevance-confirmed by \(e\) (relative to \(k\)) because the latter increases the probability of the former—provided that \(P(e\mid k) \lt 1\). Admittedly, the meaning of the latter proviso partly depends on how one handles the problem of old evidence. Yet it seems legitimate to say that Bayesian relevance confirmation (unlike the firmness view) retains a key point of ordinary scientific practice which is embedded in HD and yields further elements of clarification. Consider the following illustration. Qualitative confirmation theories comply with the idea that \(h\) is confirmed both by \(e_{1} \wedge e_{2}\) and by \(e_{1} \wedge e_{2}^*.\) In the HD case, it is clear that \(h\) entails both conjunctions, given of course \(k\) stating that tigers, lions, and elephants are all mammals (an Hempelian account could also be given easily). Bayesian relevance confirmation unequivocally yields the same qualitative verdict. There is more, however. Presumably, one might also want to say that \(h\) is more strongly confirmed by \(e_{1} \wedge e_{2}\) than by \(e_{1} \wedge e_{2}^*,\) because the former offers a more varied and diverse body of positive evidence (interestingly, on experimental investigation, this pattern prevails in most people’s judgment, including children, see Lo et al. 2002). Indeed, the variety of evidence is a fairly central issue in the analysis of confirmation (see, e.g., Bovens and Hartmann 2002, Schlosshauer and Wheeler 2011, and Viale and Osherson 2000). In the illustrative case above, higher variety is readily captured by lower probability: it just seems a priori less likely that species as diverse as tigers and elephants share some unspecified genetic trait as compared to tigers and lions, that is, \(P(e_{1} \wedge e_{2}\mid k)\lt P(e_{1} \wedge e_{2}^*\mid k).\) By (SP) above, then, one immediately gets from the relevance confirmation view the sound implication that \(C_{P}(h, e_{1} \wedge e_{2}\mid k)\gt C_{P}(h, e_{1} \wedge e_{2}^*\mid k).\) Principle (SP) is also of much use in the ravens problem. Posit \(h = \forall x(raven(x)\rightarrow black(x))\) once again. Just as HD, Bayesian relevance confirmation directly implies that \(e = black(a)\) confirms \(h\) given \(k = raven(a)\) and \(e^* =\neg raven(a)\) confirms \(h\) given \(k^* =\neg black(a)\) (provided, as we know, that \(P(e\mid k)\lt 1\) and \(P(e^*\mid k^*)\lt 1).\) That’s because \(h \wedge k\vDash e\) and \(h \wedge k^*\vDash e^*.\) But of course, to have \(h\) confirmed, sampling ravens and finding a black one is intuitively more significant than failing to find a raven while sampling the enormous set of the non-black objects. That is, it seems, because the latter is very likely to obtain anyway, whether or not \(h\) is true, so that \(P(e^*\mid k^*)\) is actually quite close to unity. Accordingly, (SP) implies that \(h\) is indeed more strongly confirmed by \(black(a)\) given \(raven(a)\) than it is by \(\neg raven(a)\) given \(\neg black(a)\)—that is, \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\gt C_{P}(h, e^*\mid k^*)\)—as long as the assumption \(P(e\mid k)\lt P(e^*\mid k^*)\) applies. What then if the sampling in not constrained \((k = \top)\) and the evidence now amounts to the finding of a black raven, \(e = raven(a) \wedge black(a)\), versus a non-black non-raven, \(e^* =\neg black(a) \wedge \neg raven(a)\)? We’ve already seen that, for either Hempelian or HD-confirmation, \(e\) and \(e^*\) are on a par: both Hempel-confirm \(h\), none HD-confirms it. In the former case, the original Hempelian version of the ravens paradox immediately arises; in the latter, it is avoided, but at a cost: \(e\) is declared flatly irrelevant for \(h\)—a bit of a radical move. Can the Bayesian do any better? Quite so. Consider the following conditions: Roughly, (i) says that the size of the ravens population does not depend on their color (in fact, on \(h\)), and (ii) that the size of the population of black non-raven objects also does not depend on the color of ravens. Note that both (i) and (ii) seem fairly sound as far as our best understanding of our actual world is concerned. It is easy to show that, in relevance-confirmation terms, (i) and (ii) are sufficient to imply that \(e = raven(a) \wedge black(a)\), but not \(e^* = \neg raven(a) \wedge \neg black(a)\), confirms \(h\), that is \(C_{P}(h,e) \gt C_{P}(h,e^*) = 0\) (this observation is due to Mat Coakley). So the Bayesian relevance approach to confirmation can make a principled difference between \(e\) and \(e^*\) in both ordinal and qualitative terms. (A much broader analysis is provided by Fitelson and Hawthorne 2010, Hawthorne and Fitelson 2010 [Other Internet Resources]. Notably, their results include the full specification of the sufficient and necessary conditions for the main inequality \(C_{P}(h, e) \gt C_{P}(h, e^*)\).) In general, Bayesian (relevance) confirmation theory implies that the evidential import of an instance of some generalization will often depend on the credence structure, and relies on its formal representation, \(P\), as a tool for more systematic analyses. Consider another instructive example. Assume that \(a\) denotes some company from some (otherwise unspecified) sector of the economy, and label the latter predicate \(S\). So, \(k = Sa\). You are informed that \(a\) increased revenues in 2019, represented as \(e = Ra\). Does this confirm \(h = \forall x(Sx \rightarrow Rx)\)? It does, at least to some degree, one would say. For an expansion of the whole sector (recall that you have no clue what this is) surely would account for the data. That’s a straightforward HD kind of reasoning (and a suitable Hempelian counterpart reconstruction would concur). But does \(e\) also confirm \(h^* = Sb \rightarrow Rb\) for some further company \(b\)? Well, another obvious account of the data \(e\) would be that company \(a\) has gained market shares at the expenses of some competitor, so that \(e\) might well seem to support \(\neg h^*,\) if anything (the revenues example is inspired by a remark in Blok, Medin, and Osherson 2007, 1362). It can be shown that the Bayesian notion of relevance confirmation allows for this pattern of judgments, because (given \(k\)) evidence \(e\) above increases the probability of \(h\) but may well have the opposite effect on \(h^*\) (see Sober 1994 for important remarks along similar lines). Notably, \(h\) entails \(h^*\) by plain instantiation, and so contradicts \(\neg h^*\). As a consequence, the implication that \(C_{P}(h,e\mid k)\) is positive while \(C_{P}(h^*,e\mid k)\) is not clashes with each of the following, and proves them unduly restrictive: the Special Consequence Condition (SCC), the Predictive Inference Condition (PIC), and the Consistency Condition (Cons). Note that these principles were all evaded by HD-confirmation, but all implied by confirmation as firmness (see above). At the same time, the most compelling features of \(F\)-confirmation, which the HD model was unable to capture, are retained by confirmation as relevance. In fact, all our measures of relevance confirmation (\(D, L\), and \(Z\)) entail the ordinal extension of the Entailment Condition (EC) as well as \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k) = -C_{P}(\neg h, e\mid k)\) and thereby Confirmation Complementarity in all of its forms (qualitative, ordinal, and quantitative). Moreover, the Bayesian confirmation theorist of either the firmness or the relevance strand can avail herself of the same quantitative strategy of “damage control” for the main specific paradox of HD-confirmation, i.e., the irrelevant conjunction problem. (See statement (CIC) above, and Crupi and Tentori 2010, Fitelson 2002. Also see Chandler 2007 for criticism, and Moretti 2006 for a related debate.) We’re left with one last issue to conclude our discussion, to wit, the blite paradox. Recall that \(blite\) is so defined: As always heretofore, we posit \(h = \forall x(raven(x)\rightarrow black(x)),\) \(h^* = \forall x(raven(x)\rightarrow blite(x)).\) We then consider the set up where \(k = raven(a) \wedge ex_{t\le T}(a),\) \(e= black(a),\) and \(P(e\mid k)\lt 1.\) Various authors have noted that, with Bayesian relevance confirmation, one has that \(P(h\mid k)\gt P(h^*\mid k)\) is sufficient to imply that \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\gt C_{P}(h^*,e\mid k)\) (see Gaifman 1979, 127–128; Sober 1994, 229–230; and Fitelson 2008, 131). So, as long as the black hypothesis is perceived as initially more credible than its blite counterpart, the former will be more strongly confirmed than the latter. Of course, \(P(h\mid k)\gt P(h^*\mid k)\) is an entirely commonsensical assumption, yet these same authors have generally, and quite understandably, failed to see this result as philosophically illuminating. Lacking some interesting, non-question-begging story as to why that inequality should obtain, no solution of the paradox seems to emerge. More modestly, one could point out that a measure of relevance confirmation \(C_{P}(h, e\mid k)\) implies (i) and (ii) below. Without a doubt, (i) and (ii) fall far short of a satisfactory solution of the blite paradox. Yet it seems at least a legitimate minimal requirement for a compelling solution (if any exists) that it implies both. It is then of interest to note that confirmation as firmness is inconsistent with (i), while Hempelian and HD-confirmation are inconsistent with (ii).
