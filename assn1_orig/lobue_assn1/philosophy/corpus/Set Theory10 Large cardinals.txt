 One cannot prove in ZFC that there exists a regular limit cardinal \(\kappa\), for if \(\kappa\) is such a cardinal, then \(L_\kappa\) is a model of ZFC, and so ZFC would prove its own consistency, contradicting Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem. Thus, the existence of a regular limit cardinal must be postulated as a new axiom. Such a cardinal is called weakly inaccessible. If, in addition \(\kappa\) is a strong limit, i.e., \(2^\lambda <\kappa\), for every cardinal \(\lambda <\kappa\), then \(\kappa\) is called strongly inaccessible. A cardinal \(\kappa\) is strongly inaccessible if and only if it is regular and \(V_\kappa \) is a model of ZFC. If the GCH holds, then every weakly inaccessible cardinal is strongly inaccessible. Large cardinals are uncountable cardinals satisfying some properties that make them very large, and whose existence cannot be proved in ZFC. The first weakly inaccessible cardinal is just the smallest of all large cardinals. Beyond inaccessible cardinals there is a rich and complex variety of large cardinals, which form a linear hierarchy in terms of consistency strength, and in many cases also in terms of outright implication. See the entry on  independence and large cardinals  for more details. To formulate the next stronger large-cardinal notion, let us say that a subset \(C\) of an infinite cardinal \(\kappa\) is closed if every limit of elements of \(C\) is also in \(C\); and is unbounded if for every \(\alpha <\kappa\) there exists \(\beta\in C\) greater than \(\alpha\). For example, the set of limit ordinals less than \(\kappa\) is closed and unbounded. Also, a subset \(S\) of \(\kappa\) is called stationary if it intersects every closed unbounded subset of \(\kappa\). If \(\kappa\) is regular and uncountable, then the set of all ordinals less than \(\kappa\) of cofinality \(\omega\) is an example of a stationary set. A regular cardinal \(\kappa\) is called Mahlo if the set of strongly inaccessible cardinals smaller than \(\kappa\) is stationary. Thus, the first Mahlo cardinal is much larger than the first strongly inaccessible cardinal, as there are \(\kappa\)-many strongly inaccessible cardinals smaller than \(\kappa\). Much stronger large cardinal notions arise from considering strong reflection properties. Recall that the Reflection Principle  (Section 4), which is provable in ZFC, asserts that every true sentence (i.e., every sentence that holds in \(V\)) is true in some \(V_\alpha\). A strengthening of this principle to second-order sentences yields some large cardinals. For example, \(\kappa\) is strongly inaccessible if and only if every \(\Sigma^1_1\) sentence (i.e., existential second-order sentence in the language of set theory, with one additional predicate symbol) true in any  structure of the form \((V_\kappa ,\in, A)\), where \(A\subseteq V_\kappa\), is true in some \((V_\alpha ,\in ,A\cap V_\alpha)\), with \(\alpha <\kappa\). The same type of reflection, but now for \(\Pi^1_1\) sentences (i.e., universal second-order sentences), yields a much stronger large cardinal property of \(\kappa\), called weak compactness. Every weakly compact cardinal \(\kappa\) is Mahlo, and the set of Mahlo cardinals smaller than \(\kappa\) is stationary. By allowing reflection for more complex second-order, or even higher-order, sentences one obtains large cardinal notions stronger than weak compactness. The most famous large cardinals, called measurable, were discovered by Stanisław Ulam in 1930 as a result of his solution to the Measure Problem. A (two-valued) measure, or ultrafilter, on a cardinal \(\kappa\) is a subset \(U\) of \(\mathcal{P}(\kappa)\) that has the following properties: (i) the intersection of any two elements of \(U\) is in \(U\); (ii) if \(X\in U\) and \(Y\) is a subset of \(\kappa\) such that \(X\subseteq Y\), then \(Y\in U\); and (iii) for every \(X\subseteq\kappa\), either \(X\in U\) or \(\kappa -X\in U\), but not both. A measure \(U\) is called \(\kappa\)-complete if every intersection of less than \(\kappa\) elements of \(U\) is also in \(U\). And a measure is called non-principal if there is no \(\alpha <\kappa\) that belongs to all elements of \(U\). A cardinal \(\kappa\) is called measurable if there exists a measure on \(\kappa\) that is \(\kappa\)-complete and non-principal. Measurable cardinals can be characterized by elementary embeddings of the universe \(V\) into some transitive class \(M\). That such an embedding \(j:V\to M\) is elementary means that \(j\) preserves truth, i.e., for every formula \(\varphi (x_1,\ldots ,x_n)\) of the language of set theory, and every \(a_1,\ldots ,a_n\), the sentence \(\varphi (a_1,\ldots ,a_n)\) holds in \(V\) if and only if \(\varphi (j(a_1),\ldots ,j(a_n))\) holds in \(M\). It turns out that a cardinal \(\kappa\) is measurable if and only if there exists an elementary embedding \(j:V\to M\), with \(M\) transitive, so that \(\kappa\) is the first ordinal moved by \(j\), i.e., the first ordinal such that \(j(\kappa)\ne \kappa\). We say that \(\kappa\) is the critical point of \(j\), and write \(crit(j)=\kappa\). The embedding \(j\) is definable from a \(\kappa\)-complete non-principal measure on \(\kappa\), using the so-called ultrapower construction. Conversely, if \(j:V\to M\) is an elementary embedding, with \(M\) transitive and \(\kappa=crit(j)\), then the set \(U=\{ X\subseteq \kappa:\kappa\in j(X)\}\) is a \(\kappa\)-complete non-principal ultrafilter on \(\kappa\). A measure \(U\) obtained in this way from \(j\) is called normal. Every measurable cardinal \(\kappa\) is weakly compact, and there are many weakly compact cardinals smaller than \(\kappa\). In fact, below \(\kappa\) there are many cardinals that are totally indescribable, i.e., they reflect all sentences, of any complexity, and in any higher-order language. If \(\kappa\) is measurable and \(j:V\to M\) is given by the ultrapower construction, then \(V_\kappa \subseteq M\), and every sequence of length less than or equal to \(\kappa\) of elements of \(M\) belongs to \(M\). Thus, \(M\) is quite similar to \(V\), but it cannot be \(V\) itself. Indeed, a famous theorem of Kenneth Kunen shows that there cannot be any elementary embedding \(j:V\to V\), other than the trivial one, i.e., the identity. All known proofs of this result use the Axiom of Choice, and it is an outstanding important question if the axiom is necessary. Kunen’s Theorem opens the door to formulating large cardinal notions stronger than measurability by requiring that \(M\) is closer to \(V\). For example, \(\kappa\) is called strong if for every ordinal \(\alpha\) there exists an elementary embedding \(j:V\to M\), for some \(M\) transitive, such that \(\kappa =crit(j)\) and \(V_\alpha \subseteq M\). Another important, and much stronger large cardinal notion is supercompactness. A cardinal \(\kappa\) is supercompact if for every \(\alpha\) there exists an elementary embedding \(j:V\to M\), with \(M\) transitive and critical point \(\kappa\), so that \(j(\kappa)>\alpha\) and every sequence of elements of \(M\) of length \(\alpha\) belongs to \(M\). Woodin cardinals fall between strong and supercompact. Every supercompact cardinal is Woodin, and if \(\delta\) is Woodin, then \(V_\delta\) is a model of ZFC in which there is a proper class of strong cardinals. Thus, while a Woodin cardinal \(\delta\) need not be itself very strong—the first one is not even weakly compact—it implies the existence of many large cardinals in \(V_\delta\). Beyond supercompact cardinals we find the extendible cardinals, the huge, the super huge, etc. Kunen’s theorem about the non-existence of a non-trivial elementary embedding \(j:V\to V\) actually shows that there cannot be an elementary embedding \(j:V_{\lambda +2}\to V_{\lambda +2}\) different from the identity, for any \(\lambda\). The strongest large cardinal notions not known to be inconsistent, modulo ZFC, are the following: There exists an elementary embedding \(j:V_{\lambda +1}\to V_{\lambda +1}\) different from the identity. There exists an elementary embedding \(j:L(V_{\lambda +1})\to L(V_{\lambda +1})\) different from the identity. Large cardinals form a linear hierarchy of increasing consistency strength. In fact they are the stepping stones of the interpretability hierarchy of mathematical theories. See the entry on  independence and large cardinals  for more details. Given any sentence \(\varphi\), exactly one the following three possibilities holds about the theory ZFC plus \(\varphi\): ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is inconsistent. ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is equiconsistent with ZFC. ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is equiconsistent with ZFC plus the existence of some large cardinal. Thus, large cardinals can be used to prove that a given sentence \(\varphi\) does not imply another sentence \(\psi\), modulo ZFC, by showing that ZFC plus \(\psi\) implies the consistency of some large cardinal, whereas ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is consistent assuming the existence of a smaller large cardinal, or just assuming the consistency of ZFC. In other words, \(\psi\) has higher consistency strength than \(\varphi\), modulo ZFC. Then, by Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem, ZFC plus \(\varphi\) cannot prove \(\psi\), assuming ZFC plus \(\varphi\) is consistent. As we already pointed out, one cannot prove in ZFC that large cardinals exist. But everything indicates that their existence not only cannot be disproved, but in fact the assumption of their existence is a very reasonable axiom of set theory. For one thing, there is a lot of evidence for their consistency, especially for those large cardinals for which it is possible to construct an inner model. An inner model of ZFC is a transitive proper class that contains all the ordinals and satisfies all ZFC axioms. Thus, \(L\) is the smallest inner model, while \(V\) is the largest. Some large cardinals, such as inaccessible, Mahlo, or weakly-compact, may exist in \(L\). That is, if \(\kappa\) has one of these large cardinal properties, then it also has the property in \(L\). But some large cardinals cannot exist in \(L\). Indeed, Scott (1961) showed that if there exists a measurable cardinal \(\kappa\), then \(V\ne L\). It is important to notice that \(\kappa\) does belong to \(L\), since \(L\) contains all ordinals, but it is not measurable in \(L\) because a \(\kappa\)-complete non-principal measure on \(\kappa\) cannot exist there. If \(\kappa\) is a measurable cardinal, then one can construct an \(L\)-like model in which \(\kappa\) is measurable by taking a \(\kappa\)-complete non-principal and normal measure \(U\) on \(\kappa\), and proceeding as in the definition of \(L\), but now using \(U\) as an additional predicate. The resulting model, called \(L[U]\), is an inner model of ZFC in which \(\kappa\) is measurable, and in fact \(\kappa\) is the only measurable cardinal. The model is canonical, in the sense that any other normal measure witnessing the measurability of \(\kappa\) would yield the same model, and has many of the properties of \(L\). For instance, it has a projective well ordering of the reals, and it satisfies the GCH. Building similar \(L\)-like models for stronger large cardinals, such as strong, or Woodin, is much harder. Those models are of the form \(L[E]\), where \(E\) is a sequence of extenders, each extender being a system of measures, that encode the relevant elementary embeddings. The largest \(L\)-like inner models for large cardinals that have been obtained so far can contain Woodin limits of Woodin cardinals (Neeman 2002). However, building an \(L\)-like model for a supercompact cardinal is still a challenge. The supercompact barrier seems to be the crucial one, for Woodin has shown that for a kind of \(L\)-like inner model for a supercompact cardinal, which he calls the Ultimate-\(L\), all stronger large cardinals that may exist in \(V\), such as extendible, huge, I1, etc. would also exist in the model. The construction of Ultimate-\(L\) is still incomplete, and it is not clear yet that it will succeed, for it rests upon some technical hypotheses that need to be confirmed. The existence of large cardinals has dramatic consequences, even for simply-definable small sets, like the projective sets of real numbers. For example, Solovay (1970) proved, assuming that there exists a measurable cardinal, that all \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^1_2\) sets of reals are Lebesgue measurable and have the Baire property, which cannot be proved in ZFC alone. And Shelah and Woodin (1990) showed that the existence of a proper class of Woodin cardinals implies that the theory of \(L(\mathbb{R})\), even with real numbers as parameters, cannot be changed by forcing, which implies that all sets of real numbers that belong to \(L(\mathbb{R})\) are regular. Further, under a weaker large-cardinal hypothesis, namely the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals, Martin and Steel (1989) proved that every projective set of real numbers is determined, i.e., the axiom of PD holds, hence all projective sets are regular. Moreover, Woodin showed that the existence of infinitely many Woodin cardinals, plus a measurable cardinal above all of them, implies that every set of reals in \(L(\mathbb{R})\) is determined, i.e., the axiom \(AD^{L(\mathbb{R})}\) holds, hence all sets of real numbers that belong to \(L(\mathbb{R})\), and therefore all projective sets, are regular. He also showed that Woodin cardinals provide the optimal large cardinal assumptions by proving that the following two statements: There are infinitely many Woodin cardinals. \(AD^{L({\Bbb R})}\). are equiconsistent, i.e., ZFC plus 1 is consistent if and only if ZFC plus 2 is consistent. See the entry on  large cardinals and determinacy  for more details and related results. Another area in which large cardinals play an important role is the exponentiation of singular cardinals. The so-called Singular Cardinal Hypothesis (SCH) completely determines the behavior of the exponentiation for singular cardinals, modulo the exponentiation for regular cardinals. The SCH follows from the GCH, and so it holds in \(L\). A consequence of the SCH is that if \(2^{\aleph_n}<\aleph_\omega\), for all finite \(n\), then \(2^{\aleph_{\omega}}=\aleph_{\omega +1}\). Thus, if the GCH holds for cardinals smaller than \(\aleph_\omega\), then it also holds at \(\aleph_\omega\). The SCH holds above the first supercompact cardinal (Solovay). But Magidor (1977) showed that, remarkably, assuming the existence of large cardinals it is possible to build a model of ZFC where the GCH first fails at \(\aleph_\omega\), hence the SCH fails. Large cardinals stronger than measurable are actually needed for this. In contrast, however, ZFC alone suffices to prove that if the SCH holds for all cardinals smaller than \(\aleph_{\omega_1}\), then it also holds for \(\aleph_{\omega_1}\). Moreover, if the SCH holds for all singular cardinals of countable cofinality, then it holds for all singular cardinals (Silver).
