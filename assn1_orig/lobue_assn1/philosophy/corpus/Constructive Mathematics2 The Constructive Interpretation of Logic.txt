 It should, by now, be clear that a full-blooded computational development of mathematics disallows the idealistic interpretations of disjunction and existence upon which most classical mathematics depends. In order to work constructively, we need to return from the classical interpretations to the natural constructive ones: These BHK-interpretations (the name reflects their origin in the work of Brouwer, Heyting, and Kolmogorov) can be made more precise using Kleene’s notion of realizability; see (Dummett [1977/2000], 222–234; Beeson [1985], Chapter VII). What sort of things are we looking for if we are serious about developing mathematics in such a way that when a theorem asserts the existence of an object \(x\) with a property \(P\), then the proof of the theorem embodies algorithms for constructing \(x\) and for demonstrating, by whatever calculations are necessary, that \(x\) has the property \(P\). Here are some examples of theorems, each followed by an informal description of the requirements for its constructive proof. Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to a given real number \(x\), decides whether \(x = 0\) or \(x \ne 0\). Note that, in order to make this decision, the algorithm might use not only the data describing \(x\) but also the data showing that \(x\) is actually a real number. Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to a set \(S\) of real numbers, a member \(s\) of \(S\), and an upper bound for \(S\), Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to the function \(f\), a modulus of continuity for \(f\), and the values \(f(0)\) and \(f(1)\), Proof requirement: An algorithm which, applied to the function \(f\), a modulus of continuity for \(f\), the values \(f(0)\) and \(f(1)\), and a positive number \(\varepsilon\), We already have reasons for doubting that (A) has a constructive proof. If the proof requirements for (B) can be fulfilled, then, given any mathematical statement \(P\), we can apply our proof of (B) to compute a rational approximation \(z\) to the supremum \(\sigma\) of the set with error \(\lt \bfrac{1}{4}\). We can then determine whether \(z \gt \bfrac{1}{4}\), in which case \(\sigma \gt 0\), or \(z \lt \bfrac{3}{4}\), when \(\sigma \lt 1\). In the first case, there exists \(x \in S\) with \(x \gt 0\), so we must have \(x = 1\) and therefore \(P\). In the case \(\sigma \lt 1\), we have \(\neg P\). Thus (B) implies the law of excluded middle. However, in Bishop’s constructive theory of the real numbers, based on Cauchy sequences with a preassigned convergence rate, we can prove the following constructive least-upper-bound principle: In passing, we mention an alternative development of the constructive theory of \(\bR\) based on interval arithmetic; see Chapter 2 of Bridges & Vîță [2006]. Each of statements (C) and (D), which are classically equivalent, is a version of the Intermediate Value Theorem. In these statements, a modulus of continuity for \(f\) is a set \(\Omega\) of ordered pairs \((\varepsilon ,\delta)\) of positive real numbers with the following two properties: Statement (C) entails another essentially nonconstructive principle, the lesser limited principle of omniscience (LLPO): For each binary sequence \((a_1,a_2,\ldots)\) with at most one term equal to 1, either \(a_n = 0\) for all even \(n\) or else \(a_n = 0\) for all odd \(n\). Statement (D), a weak form of (C), can be proved constructively, using an interval-halving argument of a standard type. The following stronger constructive intermediate value theorem, which suffices for most practical purposes, is proved using an approximate-interval-halving argument: Let \(f\) be a continuous real-valued mapping on the closed interval \([0,1]\) such that \(f(0)\cdot f(1) \lt 0\). Suppose also that \(f\) is locally nonzero, in the sense that for each \(x \in [0,1]\) and each \(r \gt 0\), there exists \(y\) such that \(\abs{x - y} \lt r\) and \(f(y) \ne 0\). Then there exists \(x\) such that \(0 \lt x \lt 1\) and \(f(x) = 0\). The situation of the intermediate value theorem is typical of many in constructive analysis, where we find one classical theorem with several constructive versions, some or all of which may be equivalent under classical logic. There is one omniscience principle whose constructive status is less clear than that of LPO and LLPO—namely, Markov’s principle (MP): For each binary sequence \((a_n)\), if it is contradictory that all the terms \(a_n\) equal 0, then there exists a term equal to 1. This principle is equivalent to a number of simple classical propositions, including the following: Markov’s principle represents an unbounded search: if you have a proof that all terms \(a_n\) being 0 leads to a contradiction, then, by testing the terms \(a_1,a_2,a_3,\ldots\) in turn, you are guaranteed to come across a term equal to 1; but this guarantee does not extend to an assurance that you will find the desired term before the end of the universe. Most practitioners of constructive mathematics view Markov’s principle with at least suspicion, if not downright disbelief. Such views are reinforced by the observation that there is a Kripke Model showing that MP is not constructively derivable (Bridges & Richman [1987], 137–138.)
