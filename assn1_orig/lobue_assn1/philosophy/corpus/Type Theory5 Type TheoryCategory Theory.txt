 There are deep connections between type theory and category theory. We limit ourselves to presenting two applications of type theory to category theory: the constructions of the free cartesian closed category and of the free topos (see the entry on category theory for an explanation of “cartesian closed” and “topos”). For building the free cartesian closed category, we extend simple type theory with the type 1 (unit type) and the product type \(A \times B\), for \(A, B\) types. The terms are extended by adding pairing operations and projections and a special element of type 1. As in Lambek and Scott 1986, one can then define a notion of typed conversions between terms, and show that this relation is decidable. One can then show (Lambek and Scott 1986) that the category with types as objects and as morphisms from \(A\) to \(B\) the set of closed terms of type \(A \rightarrow B\) (with conversion as equality) is the free cartesian closed category. This can be used to show that equality between arrows in this category is decidable. The theory of types of Church can also be used to build the free topos. For this we take as objects pairs \(A,E\) with \(A\) type and \(E\) a partial equivalence relation, that is a closed term \(E:A \rightarrow A \rightarrow o\) which is symmetric and transitive. We take as morphisms between \(A, E\) and \(B, F\) the relations \(R:A\rightarrow B\rightarrow o\) that are functional that is such that for any \(a:A\) satisfying \(E a a\) there exists one, and only one (modulo \(F)\) element \(b\) of \(B\) such that \(F b b\) and \(R a b\). For the subobject classifier we take the pair \(o, E\) with \(E:o\rightarrow o\rightarrow o\) defined as One can then show that this category forms a topos, indeed the free topos. It should be noted that the type theory in Lambek and Scott 1986 uses a variation of type theory, introduced by Henkin and refined by P. Andrews (2002) which is to have an extensional equality as the only logical connective, i.e. a polymorphic constant and to define all logical connectives from this connective and constants \(T, F : o\). For instance, one defines The equality at type \(o\) is logical equivalence. One advantage of the intensional formulation is that it allows for a direct notation of proofs based on \(\lambda\)-calculus (Martin-Löf 1971 and Coquand 1986).
