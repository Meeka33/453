 Type theory can be used as a foundation for mathematics, and indeed, it was presented as such by Russell in his 1908 paper, which appeared the same year as Zermelo’s paper, presenting set theory as a foundation for mathematics. It is clear intuitively how we can explain type theory in set theory: a type is simply interpreted as a set, and function types \(A \rightarrow B\) can be explained using the set theoretic notion of function (as a functional relation, i.e. a set of pairs of elements). The type \(A \rightarrow o\) corresponds to the powerset operation. The other direction is more interesting. How can we explain the notion of sets in terms of types? There is an elegant solution, due to A. Miquel, which complements previous works by P. Aczel (1978) and which has also the advantage of explaining non necessarily well-founded sets a la Finsler. One simply interprets a set as a pointed graph (where the arrow in the graph represents the membership relation). This is very conveniently represented in type theory, a pointed graph being simply given by a type A and a pair of elements We can then define in type theory when two such sets \(A, a, R\) and \(B, b, S\) are equal: this is the case iff there is a bisimulation \(T\) between \(A\) and \(B\) such that \(Tab\) holds. A bisimulation is a relation such that whenever \(Txy\) and \(Rxu\) hold, there exists \(v\) such that \(Tuv\) and \(Syv\) hold, and whenever \(Txy\) and \(Ryv\) hold, there exists \(u\) such that \(Tuv\) and \(Rxu\) hold. We can then define the membership relation: the set represented \(B, b, S\) is a member of the set represented by \(A, a, R\) iff there exists \(a_1\) such that \(Ra_1a\) and \(A, a_1, R\) and \(B, b, S\) are bisimilar. It can then be checked that all the usual axioms of set theory extensionality, power set, union, comprehension over bounded formulae (and even antifoundation, so that the membership relation does not need to be well-founded) hold in this simple model. (A bounded formula is a formula where all quantifications are of the form \(\forall x \in a\ldots\) or \(\exists x \in a\ldots\)). In this way it can been shown that Church’s simple type theory is equiconsistent with the bounded version of Zermelo’s set theory.
