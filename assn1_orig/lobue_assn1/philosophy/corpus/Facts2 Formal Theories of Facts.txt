 Formal studies of facts are scarce. And they are also heterogeneous, both in form and in content. In form insofar as they are formulated in languages of various kinds, which vary greatly in expressive power. And in content, not only because of the variety of views on given issues, but also because the kind of issues dealt with varies greatly. This makes it difficult to present these theories within a uniform framework. We are going to choose a specific framework, present, within that framework, (some of) the options a fact-theorist may wish to adopt, study their relationships, and give references in due course to indicate where in the resulting space of possible theories various accounts, formal and non-formal, are to be located. Our framework is significantly distinct from many of those which are used in the literature. So it should be kept in mind that in attributing this or that view to an author, what we will say is often not to be understood literally: when it is not, what we really attribute to the author is something which, translated into our framework, is what we literally attribute to her. There are two main uses of the predicate ‘is a fact’. On one of them, the predicate is rigid (necessarily, if something is a fact, then it cannot fail to be a fact). On that use, and given the assumption that there are contingent facts, it is possible that something be a fact without existing (obtaining). On the second use, nothing can be a fact unless it exists, and so on the assumption that there are contingent facts, the predicate is non-rigid. Some call facts in the first sense states of affairs or situations, reserving the word ‘fact’ to mean what ‘obtaining state of affairs’ or ‘actual situation’ mean. Throughout this section we shall use ‘fact’ in the first sense. The issues we are going to deal with fall under the following five headings: Facts and Worlds, Boolean Operations on Facts, Independency, Facts and Propositions, The Inner Structure of Facts. The presentation will be cumulative in character: in each section we will come back to topics dealt with in previous ones (if any), sometimes in order to compare the current options available to a fact-theorist to the old ones. Many metaphysicians are interested in the modal sphere. They do not only want to determine which entities there actually are and their actual properties. They wish to formulate claims with modal content, they want to determine which entities there can or must be, and which are their properties across all (metaphysically) possible worlds. In this section we deal with some basic modal issues related to facts. More precisely, we shall present and compare certain principles involving facts and (possible) worlds. Although at some places we shall mention the view that worlds are themselves facts, or sets or pluralities or sums of facts, we shall remain neutral as to the nature of worlds. Let W be the set of all possible worlds, F the function which assigns to each world w the set \(F_w\) of facts which exist in it, and F the union of all the \(F_w s\), i.e., the set of all facts. We assume that W has infinitely many members. This is a reasonable assumption, which will have some importance in what follows with respect to certain entailment claims we are going to make (not having the assumption would force us to distinguish cases). Since we are dealing with theories of facts, we shall also assume that F is non-empty. Although perhaps there are impossible states of affairs or situations, we take it that there are no impossible facts. That is why there is no room for them in our framework. Where x is a fact, \(\ES(x)\) (the existence-set of x) is the set of all worlds at which x exists. And where G is a set of facts, \(\CES(G)\) (the conjunctive-existence-set of G) is \(\cap_{x\in G} \ES(x)\), i.e., the set of worlds at which all elements of G exist, and \(\DES(G)\) (the disjunctive-existence-set of G) is \(\cup_{x\in G} \ES(x)\), i.e., the set of worlds at which some elements of G exist. Notice that \(\CES(\varnothing) = W\), \(\DES(\varnothing) = \varnothing\), and that given any \(G \ne \varnothing\), \(\CES(G) \subseteq \DES(G)\). (Here and elsewhere, we borrow some vocabulary and symbolism from Fine 1982.) We shall say that a set of facts G characterizes a set of worlds V iff \(\CES(G) = V\), and that a fact x characterizes a set of worlds V iff \(\ES(x) = V\) (no confusion should arise from the ambiguity of ‘characterize’). At this very early point some work can already be done. We assume the following definitions: Of special interest are the following Boolean principles (‘\(\setsub\)’ refers to the operation of set-theoretic subtraction): If facts can be negated, then the negation of fact x (if any) will have existence-set \(W \setsub \ES(x)\). If facts can be conjoined, then the conjunction of the facts in set G (if any) will have existence-set \(\CES(G)\). And if facts can be disjoined, then the disjunction of the facts in set G (if any) will have existence-set \(\DES(G)\). One can then understand why we call these principles ‘Boolean’. B1 and B3 together entail B4. Assuming B1 and B4, B2 is equivalent to B3. Notice that if it is assumed that every world contains at least one fact (a principle we shall call ‘Plenitude’), then B3 implies B4 (take \(G = F)\). Also notice that both B1 and B4 entail Plenitude. See Figure 1. Figure 1. It is tempting to adopt the principle: No Twins. Worlds with the very same facts (twins, for short) are identical, i.e., \(F_{w} = F_{v}\) implies \(w = v\), i.e., F is injective. Another formulation of No Twins might be the following: the identity of a world is completely determined by which facts hold in it. No Twins imposes serious constraints on the cardinality of F. In particular, since there are infinitely many worlds, No Twins implies that there must also be infinitely many facts. The B-principles assert the existence of facts characterising various sets of worlds. Similar principles of special interest are of the same vein: The W-principles have mates of a certain interest: A set* is a set of worlds which contains all twins of its members \((\varnothing\) and W are then sets*), and a singleton* is a set* whose members are all twins. Notice that all existence-sets, conjunctive existence-sets and disjunctive existence-sets, as well as their complements in W, are sets*. W4 entails both W2 and W3, and in turn each of them entails W1. All the same, W\(4'\) entails both W\(2'\) and W\(3'\), and in turn each of them entails W\(1'\). No Twins is a consequence of W1. Under the assumption that No Twins is true, each Wi is equivalent to W\(i'\). So each Wi entails W\(i'\). W\(4'\) entails all the Bs. W\(1'\) entails Plenitude. W4 is thus an extremely strong principle, since it entails all the principles we have met so far. See Figure 2. Figure 2. W\(4'\) is equivalent to B\(2 +\) W\(3'\), W\(2'\) plus B3 yields W\(4'\), W\(1'\) plus B2 yields W\(2'\). B1 yields W\(1'\). See Figure 3. Figure 3. All the previous principles are compatible with there being distinct facts existing at exactly the very same worlds. One may wish to deny that this is possible, and adopt: Modal Criterion. Two facts are identical if they have the same existence-set, i.e., \(x = y\) whenever \(\ES(x) = \ES(y)\). This provides a modal criterion for the identity of facts. If Modal Criterion is accepted, each B-principle is equivalent to the result of replacing in the principle ‘some fact’ by ‘a unique fact’. The same holds of W2, W\(2'\), W4 and W\(4'\). Modal Criterion is controversial. One may wish to claim that there are such things as the fact that Socrates exists, the fact that Socrates exists and every number is a number, and the fact that singleton [Socrates] exists, and that all or some of these facts are distinct. But given plausible assumptions about the existence-conditions of these facts, they all have the same existence-set. Modal Criterion holds in the views put forward in Wittgenstein TLP, Suszko 1968 and Fine 1982 (in theories F(A)-Cond and C-Cond). It does not hold in Fine’s theory F-Cond (Fine 1982) and Zalta’s theory (Zalta 1991), under the two interpretations indeed. References relative to previous principles will be given later on. More detail is available in the  supplementary document on Some Formal Theories in the Literature. There is a view according to which propositions are sets of worlds. One might prefer to identify facts with sets of worlds (this is what is done in Restall 2004). On this view, for every fact x, \(\ES(x) = x\), and for every world \(w, F_w = \{x : x\in F\) and \(w\in x\}\). Modal Criterion is then satisfied. Suppose that all non-empty sets of worlds are facts. This is a very natural option for the view under consideration, and is actually countenanced by Restall. Then the strong W4 is satisfied. On a dual view, worlds are taken to be sets of facts, a world being identified with its own domain: for every world \(w, F_w = w\). On that view, No Twins is trivially true. Variants on that view take worlds to be pluralities, or mereological sums of facts. Cresswell (Cresswell 1972) is in the set camp, Wittgenstein (TLP), it seems, in the plurality camp. Still another view is that worlds are themselves facts (Suszko 1968, Plantinga 1974 and Zalta 1991). A natural claim, on that view, is that each world belongs to its own domain and to it only, i.e., that for every world w, \(\ES(w) = \{w\}\). If this is accepted, No Twins and W2 are true. Here is a simple theory which goes in that direction (Wolniewicz 1982). Let us take the notion of a fact containing another fact as a primitive. We shall use ‘\(x \le y\)’ for ‘x is contained in y’, and we shall take relation \(\le\) to be reflexive, antisymmetric and transitive. One option is to define fact containment in modal terms (i.e., define ‘\(x \le y\)’ as ‘necessarily, x exists if y does’), but we shall remain neutral on this issue. Let us define a world as a maximal fact under the relation of fact-containment: x is a world iff for every fact y, if \(x \le y\), then \(x = y\). We assume that every fact is contained in some world. We then define the domain \(F_w\) of world w to be the set of all facts w contains. Thus the union of all the domains is the set of all facts. Clearly, each world belongs to its own domain and to it only: \(\ES(w) = \{w\}\). So (as we previously pointed out) No Twins and W2 hold, and Modal Criterion is ensured if we accept the principle according to which two facts are identical provided that they are contained in the very same worlds. Propositions can be negated, conjoined and disjoined to other propositions. As we previously saw, there is an issue as to whether the same holds of facts. In this section we introduce the Boolean operations on facts, and point to the four main views as to which of these operations actually exist. An operation of negation on facts is a function \(\cdot^{\textbf{n}}\) which satisfies the following axioms: The existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B1. In turn, the existence of an operation of negation is ensured if Modal Criterion and B1 are accepted—in particular under the view which takes facts to be sets of worlds; in that case, set-complementation is a negation operation. An operation of conjunction on facts is a function \(\cdot^{\textbf{c}}\) which obeys the following principles: The existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B2. In turn, the existence of an operation of conjunction is ensured if Modal Criterion and B2 are accepted—in particular under the view of facts as sets of worlds; in that case, intersection is a conjunction operation. Finally, an operation of disjunction on facts is a function \(\cdot^{\textbf{d}}\) which has the following properties: The existence of a negation operation ensures the truth of B3. In turn, the existence of an operation of disjunction is ensured if Modal Criterion and B3 are accepted—in particular under the view of facts as sets of worlds; in that case, union is a disjunction operation. Suppose all three operations are accepted (in which case all the Bs are true). It is then possible to define an operation in terms of negation and conjunction which behaves almost exactly like disjunction. Let \(\varrho(F)\) be the set of all sets of facts G with \(G \ne \varnothing\) and \(\DES(G) \ne W\). Where H is any set of facts, we let \(\mathbf{n}H\) be \(\{x^\textbf{n}\) : \(x\in H\cap F^{\#}\}\), the negative image of H. This disjunction-like operation, \(\cdot^{\delta}\), is a (total) function from \(\varrho(F)\) to \(F^{\#}\) defined by the following condition: \(G^{\delta} = (\mathbf{n}G)^{\textbf{{cn}}}\). \(\cdot^{\delta}\) behaves like disjunction in that it satisfies the principles resulting from replacing ‘\(P(F)^*\)’ by ‘\(\varrho(F)\)’ in D1–D4. Some extra principles must then presumably be introduced, as we presumably want \(^{\textbf{d}}\) and \(^{\delta}\) to coincide on \(\varrho(F)\). We may just adopt the principle which says this: Here is a table indicating, for some theories, which operations they allow \((+\) means acceptance and \(-\) rejection): (On the entries containing a *, see the supplementary document  Some Formal Theories in the Literature.)  In the case of Restall, commitment to all three operations directly follows from the fact that his theory validates W4 and Modal Criterion. Taylor in fact has no modal theory of facts, but it seems that in a natural modal extension of his theory the previously mentioned acceptance claims should be correct. The restrictions in Taylor’s case are due to the fact that he works with standard first-order languages. Taylor is concerned with giving a theory of the facts “posited” by standard first-order languages, i.e., of the facts which play a role in determining the truth-values of the sentences of that language. Standard first-order languages admit of conjunction and disjunction only on finite collections of sentences, hence the restrictions relative to facts. But clearly, moving to languages in which infinite conjunctions and disjunctions are freely allowed, the restrictions would vanish. In the light of the previous table, there are four main views as to which Boolean operations are to be accepted: (The restrictions for conjunction and disjunction indicated in the table are due to accidental limitations in expressive power, as we pointed out for the case of Taylor, and point out for the other cases in the supplementary document  Some Formal Theories in the Literature.) Say that a set of facts G is independent iff G is not empty and any of its subsets H is such that there is a domain \(F_w\) such that such that \(G \cap F_w = H\). That G is independent means (i) that any collection of facts in G may obtain together without any other fact in G obtaining, and (ii) that no fact in G need obtain. Let \(^{\textbf{n}}\), \(^{\textbf{c}}\), \(^{\textbf{d}}\) be Boolean operations, of negation, conjunction and disjunction, respectively. Where G is any set of facts, we put: Each world-domain is maximal consistent. Maximal consistency entails conjunctive closure, so each world-domain is maximal consistent. A maximal set of facts contains all non-contingent facts (if any), and is never empty. Where G and H are any set of facts, we shall say that: Notice that \(\mathbf{dc}(H \cup \mathbf{n}H)\) is the smallest set of facts containing H closed under the Boolean operations. Suppose there is an independent set H. Then if \(H = F\) or H generates F via conjunction, then all facts are contingent. Moreover, Modal Criterion holds if \(H = F\) or generates F via conjunction or Booleanization. We shall now consider three particular theories of facts involving the notions of independence and generation: Let \(\phi\) be the function which associates to each singleton* the common domain of its members. Consider now the following principles: For \(i = 1, 3\) or 4, \(\textrm{T}_i\) entails Co\(_i\). If No Twins is added to each theory, each \(\textrm{T}_i\) entails the principle which results from replacing ‘\(\phi\)’ by ‘F’ and ‘the set of all singletons’ by ‘W’ in Co\(_i\): Some properties of our theories are depicted in the following table, where ‘+’ means ‘holds’, ‘−’ means ‘fails to hold’ and ‘?’ means ‘indeterminate’. In the presence of No Twins, \(\textrm{T}_4\) entails all the Ws. \(\textrm{T}_1\) is a component of Wittgenstein’s logical atomism in Wittgenstein TLP. It also appears in Cresswell 1972. Suszko 1968 has something very close to \(\textrm{T}_4\) (cf. the supplementary document  Some Formal Theories in the Literature). Armstrong (1997) works with a different notion of independency, which we may call independency*. A set of facts is independent* iff given any of it subsets G and any of its member x not in G, it is possible that the members of G exist without x, and it is also possible that they exist with x. Independency is strictly stronger than independency*: The independency*, but not the independency, of a set is compatible with there being a member of that set existing in every world (not the same member each time, of course). Armstrong expresses the hope that the set of atomic facts he countenances is independent*, though he recognizes that there may be difficulties to defend the view. We do not know whether he would express the hope that the set of atomic facts he countenances is independent tout court. Anyway, even if he held the view he would not endorse \(\textrm{T}_3\), since he recognizes “totality facts” (cf.  section 2.4.2),  which are not conjunctions of atomic facts. As we pointed out above, one view about facts is that to be a fact is to be a true proposition. On another, incompatible view, facts are what make true propositions true, or more generally, account for their truth. The search for what accounts for the truth of propositions is, as we have seen, actually one main rationale for the introduction of facts. In what follows we shall deal with the two views. By ‘proposition’, we shall mean truth-bearer, and remain neutral as to whether truth-bearers are sentences, statements, beliefs or abstract objects expressed by sentences, for instance—except in  section 2.4.1. Each world w has its set \(\textrm{T}_w\) of true propositions, and we call \(\TS(p)\) (the truth-set of p) the set of all worlds at which p is true. Where p is a proposition, let \(\ES(p)\) (the existence-set of p) be the set of all worlds at which it exists. Let us consider here the view that to be a fact is to be a true proposition. On such a view, propositions cannot be sentences or statements or beliefs. They are, perhaps, abstract entities expressed or designated by sentences. There is an issue as to what the existence-conditions for propositions (taken in that sense, the qualification will be constant in this section) are, which is relevant for the view under consideration. On one view, propositions exist necessarily, i.e., the existence-set of any proposition is W, the set of all possible worlds. On another view, the existence of a proposition is in general world-relative. The world-relative view comes in several variants. Two such variants which will be of central interest to us correspond to the two possible answers to the question ‘Can a proposition be true without existing?’. The view that a proposition can be true without existing is quite plausible under the assumption that propositions expressed by sentences which contain proper names are composite objects which literally contain the individuals denoted by these names. For it is plausible to maintain that no whole can exist without its parts, and if this and the previously mentioned assumption are true, then the proposition expressed by ‘Socrates is not a philosopher’ will turn out true in worlds where it does not exist (it is assumed here that there can be no non-existent philosopher, and that Socrates is not a necessary existent). (Against this line of thought, see the discussion of New Actualism in the entry on  actualism.) There is a conception of propositions according to which they are sets of worlds (see, e.g., Stalnaker 1976). On such a conception, the truth-set of a proposition is the proposition itself, and issues about propositional existence remain: it may be held that propositions exist necessarily, or that their existence is in general world-relative. The first option seems intrinsically the most natural, and a proponent of the world-relative view will most naturally identify the existence-set of a proposition with its truth-set—or so it seems. Where w is a world, let \(P_w\) be the set of propositions which exists in it, and let P be \(\cup_{w\in W} P_{w}\), the set of all propositions. On the view that to be a fact is to be a true proposition, the set of facts which exist in world w is the set of all propositions which exist and are true at w, i.e., \(F_{w} = T_w \cap P_{w}\), and the existence-set of a fact x is \(\ES(x) \cap \TS(x)\). (There is a similar view according to which all facts are true propositions, while some true propositions—say, the complex ones—may not be facts, but we leave it aside.) Of course, under the assumption that no proposition can be true without existing, in particular under the assumption that they exist necessarily, for every world \(w, F_{w} = T_{w}\), and the existence-set of a fact x is \(\TS(x)\). Suppose that propositions exist necessarily. It is plausible to say that propositions can be freely negated, conjoined and disjoined to other propositions. On that view, there are operations of negation, conjunction and disjunction of facts which obey the principles we previously introduced. The resulting view is thus extremely strong. If not all propositions exist necessarily, then questions related to the Boolean operations receive answers which may vary according to the existence-conditions which are imposed on propositions. As we have emphasized, one of the main rationale for introducing facts has been to account for the truth of true propositions. The idea is that whenever a proposition is true, its truth is to be explained in terms of the existence and / or non-existence of some facts. A minimal requirement one may wish to impose in that direction is the following: Supervenience. \(F_{w} = F_{v}\) implies \(T_{w} = T_{v}\). This says that truth supervenes on facts: no difference in truth without a difference in facts. Supervenience is a direct consequence of No Twins, but one may wish to leave open the possibility of distinct worlds containing the same facts. (On the view that to be a fact is to be a true proposition, Supervenience trivially holds if it is assumed that no proposition can be true if it does not exist. If that assumption is dropped, then there is room for Supervenience to fail. That might be taken to be an argument for keeping the assumption on the view under consideration.) Let us say that a property \(\phi\) is a fact-condition iff it is a binary relation connecting sets of sets of facts and worlds, such that given any set of sets of facts \(\Gamma\) and any worlds w and v, if \(F_{w} = F_{v}\), then \(\phi(\Gamma ,w)\) iff \(\phi(\Gamma ,v)\) (i.e., the holding of the condition supervenes on which facts there are). The following principle better captures the idea that facts account for the truth of true propositions: Determination. For every proposition p and every world w at which it is true, there exists a fact-condition \(\phi\) and a set \(\Gamma\) of sets of facts such that Determination clearly entails Supervenience. Let us examine some stronger principles. Let us say that some given facts (jointly) necessitate proposition p iff p is true in every world where they all exist. The facts in set G (jointly) necessitate p iff \(\CES(G) \subseteq \TS(p)\). Let us also say that some given facts (jointly) make true proposition p in world w iff they all exist in w and they necessitate the proposition. Let us finally say that proposition p represents some given facts iff in every world where p is true, some of them exist. Proposition p represents the facts in G iff \(\TS(p) \subseteq \DES(G)\). Our definition of truthmaking fails to capture the explanatory character of the notion people have usually in mind when they talk about truthmaking. If something makes a given proposition true, it is usually assumed, then the existence of that thing explains the truth of the proposition. Now it should be clear that truthmaking as we have defined it is not explanatory in this sense. For everything whatsoever is a truthmaker (in our sense) for any necessary proposition, while arguably, the obtaining of the fact that Philipp lives in Geneva fails to explain the truth of your favourite tautology. Or again, consider Socrates and its singleton-set, [Socrates]. It may be argued, as we previously stressed, that granted that there are such things as the fact that Socrates exists and the fact that [Socrates] exists, these two facts obtain in exactly the same worlds. Assume this is the case. Now some may be happy with the view that the fact that Socrates exists is a truthmaker (in the usual sense) for the proposition that Socrates exists—and so with the view that the obtaining of the fact explains the truth of the proposition, but the view that the truth of that proposition is explained by the obtaining of the fact that the singleton exists is highly implausible. Yet if the fact that Socrates exists is a truthmaker (in our sense) for the proposition that Socrates exists, then the fact that the singleton exists is also a truthmaker (in our sense) for that proposition. Representation, as we have defined it, is also quite remote from what people usually have in mind when they speak of propositions representing facts: propositions which cannot be true represent (in our sense) any fact whatsoever, and if the proposition that Socrates exists represents (in our sense) the fact that Socrates exists, then it also represents (in our sense) the fact that [Socrates] exists (granted that these two facts exist at the same worlds). Despite the fact that truthmaking as defined above does not to capture the usual concept of making true, we shall not deal with the latter concept here. And we shall not deal either with the usual notion of representation. Let us now turn to the stronger principles. A very strong principle connecting propositions and facts says that for every proposition p which can be true, there exists a fact represented by p which necessitates p (i.e., a fact which makes the proposition true in every world where it is true). The principle just says that for every proposition which can be true, there is a fact whose existence-set is identical to the proposition’s truth-set: (\(P^{\circ}\) is the set of all propositions which can be true.) This is a very strong principle. Under reasonable assumptions, P1 entails the strong principle W4. For instance, this is so under the assumption that every set of worlds is the truth-set of some proposition. This assumption trivially holds if sets of worlds are taken to be propositions, but such an assumption is not needed. For let V be any set of worlds. Assume that No Twins is true. To each world w associate the conjunction \(c_w\) of all propositions true in w (we suppose it exists), and consider the disjunction \(d_V\) of all \(c_w, w\in V\) (we suppose it exists). Then \(\TS(d_V) = V\). Theory F(A)-Cond described in Fine 1982 licences P1, as well as the theory put forward in Zalta 1991 (cf. the supplementary document  Some Formal Theories in the Literature).  As we saw, Taylor (1985) has no modal theory of facts, but it seems that in a natural modal extension of his theory, P1 should hold. Notice that P1 is immediate on the view that facts are sets of worlds, and that all non-empty sets of worlds are facts (the view put forward in Restall 2004). For then, \(\ES(x) = x\) for any fact x. P1 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \(\textrm{T}_4\). Consider the following assumptions \((H_0\) is a selected independent set which generates F via Booleanization): A friend of \(\textrm{T}_4\) may be willing to accept them, and doing so he will thereby endorse P1. There is a simpler argument against P1 enemies of disjunctive facts may advance. Take any two propositions p and q and assume they have a disjunction r (we may assume that p can be true and q false, and vice versa). By P1, there are facts \(x, y\) and z such that \(\ES(x) = \TS(p)\) and \(\ES(y) = \TS(q)\) and \(\ES(z) = \TS(r)\). So \(\ES(z) = \ES(x) \cup \ES(y)\), and z behaves like a disjunctive fact: it exists in a world iff x or y does. Those who take these to be problems may endorse the following weaker principle: for every proposition p which can be true and every world w at which it is true, there is a fact which makes it true. That principle is equivalent to: for every proposition p which can be true, there exists a set of facts G whose members are represented by p such that every member of G necessitates p. To put it differently, for every proposition which can be true, there is set of facts whose disjunctive existence-set is identical to the proposition’s truth-set: This principle is endorsed by Armstrong (1997), and seems to be taken by Fine as fitting his theory C-Cond (Fine 1982; cf. the supplementary document  Some Formal Theories in the Literature). But there are still potential problems, this time related to conjunction. For take the conjunctive proposition that Socrates is a philosopher and Frege is human. P2 tells us that there is a set of facts K such that \(\DES(K)\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What is that set of facts? One may be tempted to answer: the set whose sole member is the fact that Socrates is a philosopher and Frege is human. It is hard to see which other answer could be provided, and so P2 seems to commit one to conjunctive facts. Those who are bothered by these features of P1 and P2 may wish to adopt the following principle: there is a special set of propositions Q such that (i) the restriction of P1 to Q holds, i.e., for every p in Q, there is a fact x such that \(\ES(x) = \TS(p)\), and (ii) for every world w where a proposition p is true, there is a part R of Q whose members are true, and such that in every world where they are true, p is true. But there are still potential problems, which actually affect P2 as well, this time related to negation. Take the negative proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher. By P2, there is a set of facts K such that \(\DES(K)\) is the truth-set of that proposition. What is that set of facts? One may wish to answer: the set whose sole member is the fact that Socrates is not a philosopher. Again, it is hard to think of any alternative, and so P2 seems to commit one to negative facts. Alternatively, assume the previous principle. Shall we take the proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher to be in Q or not? If we do, then we are in the same situation as before: we seem to be committed to negative facts. If we do not, it is hard to see which set of propositions \(R \subseteq Q\) satisfying condition (ii) above we are going to choose. In order to deal with negative propositions, Armstrong (1997) invokes a certain kind of facts which he calls ‘totality facts’, facts which can be designated by means of expressions of type ‘the fact that X are all the Fs that there are’, where ‘X’ is a rigid plural designator and ‘F’ a predicate. The proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher is made true, on his view, by the fact that the atomic facts which actually obtain are all the atomic facts there are—a totality fact. Those who are reluctant to admit disjunctive, conjunctive, negative and totality facts may wish to adopt the following principle (weaker than P2): P3 says that the following is true of every proposition p which can be true: for every world where p is true, there are two sets of facts G and H such that (i) in w, all members of G exist and none of H do, and (ii) in every world where this is the case, p is true. That principle is rather ugly, but it does what it should do. P3 might be accepted by a proponent of theory \(\textrm{T}_1\). Consider the following assumptions: A friend of \(\textrm{T}_1\) may be willing to accept them—Wittgenstein (TLP) does—and if he does, he will thereby accept P3. Even the weak principle P3 faces some difficulties. Consider a true universal proposition, say the proposition that every finger of my right hand is less than 1m long. It seems that unless some controversial assumptions are made (like Wittgenstein’s view that universal propositions are conjunctions), to countenance P3 involves accepting that there is something like the fact that every finger of my right hand is less than 1m long and claiming that its existence-set is identical to the truth-set of the proposition in question. Following Wittgenstein (TLP), many reject such universal facts. In the other camp are e.g., Russell (PLA) and Armstrong (1997; Armstrong invokes certain totality facts, which have indeed a universal component.). There is an alternative approach which escapes all the previous difficulties. The idea is that facts make true certain basic propositions, and the truth-value of the remaining, more complex propositions is determined by the basic truths and the particular content of these propositions. This is the view put forward in Wittgenstein TLP: the atomic facts make true the true atomic propositions, and whether a complex proposition (for him, a Boolean combination of atomic propositions) is completely settled by what happens at the atomic level. Views of that kind are rather attractive, since they tend to favour parsimonious ontologies of facts. But they prove especially difficult to develop, especially when special propositions are taken into account, e.g., propositions involving modal concepts. There is, as we have seen, an issue as to whether facts are complex entities or not, and as to how (if at all) the various facts are composed and as to what composition means here. (This question is not always independent of the question whether propositions are complex. This is obvious if facts are taken to be true propositions. But even if the identification is rejected, it may nevertheless be maintained that facts share important features with propositions. On propositional complexity, see the entries on  singular propositions  and  structured propositions.) The view that there is an operation of negation, or conjunction, or disjunction on facts is compatible with the claim that some facts are complex. For on a natural view, a conjunctive fact is literally composed by the facts of which it is a conjunction—and similarly for negation and disjunction. (Notice that admitting any two of the Boolean operations would then force one to accept that there are several ways in which the very same facts can combine in order to make up a fact.) Acceptance of some Boolean operations on facts is compatible with taking facts to be complex, but it does not entail it: one may accept, e.g., that a given fact is the conjunction of other facts, and at the same time believe, say, that its depends for its identity on them without having them as parts. The issue of the complexity of facts also arises independently of issues of Boolean composition. It is a widespread view among the friends of facts that certain facts are complex entities made up of objects and properties or relations, and correspond to certain simple predications, at least in the sense that in every world, the predication is true if the fact obtains. Call such facts substantial facts, and that view Substantialism. We may designate the substantial fact that objects \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n\) stand in relation R (in that order) by ‘[R; \(a_1 , \ldots ,a_n\)]’. According to Substantialism, the sentence ‘Socrates is mortal’ corresponds in the previous sense to a certain fact composed of Socrates and of the property of being mortal, namely [being mortal; Socrates], which obtains in a world only if in that world, Socrates exemplify the property of being mortal. (There may easily be disagreement about this very example, as indeed with any particular example.) Substantialism is a form of what Fine calls ‘objectualism’ (Fine 1982). Substantialist views are put forward in Russell PLA, Suszko 1968, Van Fraassen 1969, Taylor 1985, Armstrong 1997, and perhaps Wittgenstein TLP (‘perhaps’, because it is not clear which kinds of objects compose facts according to him). The existence-conditions of a whole often depend upon facts about its parts. If there are disjunctive / conjunctive facts which contain the corresponding disjuncts / conjuncts, then any such fact exists in a world iff some disjuncts / all the conjuncts do. And if there is a negative fact containing the corresponding negated item, the former fact exists in a world iff the latter does not. These existence-conditions are written into the nature of the Boolean operations. When we come to substantial facts, things are not so straightforward. A comparison with sets may be useful. There is a view according to which the existence of a set requires that of its members: in a world where, say, Socrates exists but not Plato, the set [Socrates, Plato] does not exist. And there is the more liberal view which says that every set exists necessarily. Corresponding to these two positions are the following two views about facts: The two views are identical if no objects can have a property unless the objects and the property exist. Otherwise they are distinct. Suppose there is such a thing as the fact [being human; Socrates]. Both views can countenance such an object. But for the first the fact will exist only in worlds where Socrates exists, while for the second it is sufficient that Socrates has the property of being human. And it may be held that Socrates has the property in all possible worlds, even in those where he fails to exist. (Of course, there is a similar issue regarding the existence-conditions of facts across times.) It is clear that this divergence potentially has dramatic consequences for one’s conception of the relationships between facts and propositions. Take for granted that it is necessary that Socrates is human, and that Socrates only contingently exists. Then a proponent of view (b), but not a proponent of view (a), can claim that the proposition that Socrates is human is true in a world iff [being human; Socrates] exists in that world. A substantialist may either deny or accept that there is an operation of conjunction on facts. If he accepts it, he will presumably view conjunctions of substantial facts as themselves complex entities (the opposite view would be very odd), doubly complex indeed, having a conjunctive structure and the conjuncts in turn having their own internal composition. Similar considerations hold of disjunction and negation. Proponents of (a) are likely to deny that there is an operation of negation on facts. For take the fact [being a philosopher; Socrates], and suppose there is a corresponding negation x. Then as we saw, it would be odd to claim that x is not a complex fact, having Socrates as a component. Suppose x has such a complexity. Now take two worlds w and v, such that in w Socrates exists but is not a philosopher, and in v, Socrates does not exist (and so is not a philosopher either). Then in both worlds, the proposition that Socrates is not a philosopher is true. And according to a proponent of view (a), x exists in w but not in v. The outcome is rather odd. Similar considerations hold of disjunction, but not of conjunction. So far we have considered two types of complexity facts may have: Boolean complexity (which in turn divides into the various types corresponding to the various Boolean operations) and the complexity of substantial facts. But there are many other types of complexity one may take facts to have. Think of universal facts (the fact that all men have a brain), modal facts (the fact that it is possible that Socrates is a football player), and so on. The identity-conditions of a whole often depends upon facts about its parts. When are two substantial facts \([R; a, b]\) and \([S; c, d]\) identical? A plausible answer is: when \(R = S, a = c\) and \(b = d\). This answer has consequences for a friend of Modal Criterion. Accepting both the proposed identity-condition and Modal Criterion, one cannot claim that there are distinct but necessarily coextensive properties (which are part of some facts), or that the facts [being human; Socrates] and [having a human member; [Socrates]] are distinct, even on the plausible assumption that they exist in the very same worlds.
