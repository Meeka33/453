 A vocabulary in second-order logic is just as a vocabulary in first order logic, that is, a set L of relation, function and constant symbols. Each relation and function symbol has an arity, which is a positive natural number. Second-order logic has several kinds of variables. It has individual variables denoted by lower case letters \(x, y, z, \ldots\) possibly with subscripts. It has property and relation variables denoted by upper case letters \(X,Y,Z,\ldots\) possibly with subscripts. Finally, it has function variables denoted by upper case letters \(F, G, H, \ldots\) possibly with subscripts. Sometimes function variables are omitted as, after all, functions are special kinds of relations. Each relation and function variable has an arity, which is a positive natural number. It is noteworthy that although we have property variables we do not have variables for properties of properties. Such variables would be part of the formalism of third order logic, see  ยง12. The terms of second-order logic are defined recursively as follows: Constant symbols and individual variables are terms. If \(t_1,\ldots,t_n\) are terms, U is an n-ary function symbol and F is an n-ary function variable, then \(U(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) and \(F(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) are terms. Note that terms denote individuals, not relations or properties. Thus X alone is not a term but x is. The atomic formulas of second-order logic are defined from terms as follows: If t and \(t'\) are terms, then \(t = t'\) is an atomic formula. If R is an n-ary relation symbol and \(t_1,\ldots,t_n\) are terms, then \(R(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) is an atomic formula. If X is an n-ary relation variable, then also \(X(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) is an atomic formula. The intuitive meaning of \(X(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) is that the elements \(t_1,\ldots, t_n\) are in the relation X or are predicated by X. We do not allow atomic formulas of the form \(X = Y\), although they would have an obvious meaning. We achieve the same effect by using quantifiers. Definition 1 The formulas of second-order logic are defined as follows: Atomic formulas are formulas. If \(\phi\) and \(\psi\) are formulas, then \(\neg\phi\), \(\phi\land \psi\), \(\phi\lor \psi\), \(\phi \to \psi\) and \(\phi \leftrightarrow \psi\) are formulas. If \(\phi\) is a formula, x an individual variable, X a relation variable and F a function variable, then \(\exists x\phi\), \(\forall x\phi\), \(\exists X\phi\), \(\forall X\phi, \exists F\phi\) and \(\forall F\phi\) are formulas. An important special case is monadic second-order logic where no function variables are allowed and the relation variables are required to be monadic (a.k.a. unary), i.e., of arity one. We did not take \(X=Y\) as an atomic formula (although we could have) but having introduced the quantifiers we can use as a substitute for \(X=Y\). The advantage of taking \(X=Y\) as a basic atomic formula would be that using (\ref{XY}) brings along extra quantifiers. Sometimes it is interesting to minimize the number of quantifiers in a formula. The concepts of a free and bound occurrence of a variable in a formula are defined in the usual way. A formula is called a sentence if it has no free variables. The concept of a term being free for a variable in a formula is defined as in first order logic.
