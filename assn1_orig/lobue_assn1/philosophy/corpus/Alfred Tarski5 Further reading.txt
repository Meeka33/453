 Tarski’s papers are reprinted and collected in Tarski (1986b). The volume Tarski (1983a) contains widely used English translations of his main papers of the 1920s and 1930s. Givant (1986) gives a complete bibliography of Tarski’s publications until 1986. Feferman and Feferman (2004) is a biography of Tarski that also contains a very valuable introduction to his logical and mathematical work, including descriptions of all the results and developments mentioned in the initial paragraph of this entry. On Tarski’s logical work see also Simmons (2009) and Eastaugh (2017). McFarland, McFarland and Smith (2014) contains a wealth of biographical and historical information about Tarski, as well as updates to Givant’s bibliography and translations into English of a number of previously untranslated early texts by Tarski. Collections of articles devoted to (parts of) Tarski’s work include: vols. 51 (1986) and 53 (1988) of the Journal of Symbolic Logic; Woleński and Köhler (1999); vols. 126 (2001) and 142 (2004) of Synthese; vols. 126 and 127 of the Annals of Pure and Applied Logic (2004); and Patterson (2008a). Patterson (2012) is a book-length historical and philosophical study of many of Tarski’s philosophical ideas, focusing on truth and logical consequence. Gruber (2016) is a book-length commentary of Tarski’s monograph on truth, “The Concept of Truth in Formalized Languages”, which compares the Polish original version, the German translation, and the English version of the German text. There is a considerable bibliography on critical and exegetical aspects of Tarski’s philosophical work. The bibliography on truth is especially extensive. It includes the chapters on Tarski’s theory of truth in Coffa (1991), Kirkham (1992), Soames (1999) and (2010), and Künne (2003), the second part of Woleński (1999), the papers Field (1972), Davidson (1973, 1990), Kripke (1975), Church (1976), Soames (1984), Putnam (1985), Hodges (1985/6, 2004, 2008), McGee (1993), García-Carpintero (1996), Heck (1997), Murawski (1998), DeVidi and Solomon (1999), Ketland (1999), Milne (1999), Sher (1999), Gómez-Torrente (2001, 2004), Eklund (2002), Gupta (2002), Rojszczak (2002), Raatikainen (2003), (2008), Ray (2003, 2005, 2018), Sundholm (2003), Feferman (2004a), Frost-Arnold (2004), Hintikka (2004), Patterson (2004, 2008b), Azzouni (2005, 2008), Horwich (2005), Burgess (2008), David (2008), Mancosu (2008), Simons (2008), Asay (2013), Schiemer and Reck (2013), Loeb (2014), Barnard and Ulatowski (2016), Smith (2017), and the entries on the  liar paradox,  model theory,   Tarski: truth definitions, and   truth. The critical and exegetical bibliography on Tarski on logical consequence includes the corresponding chapter in Kneale and Kneale (1962), Etchemendy (1988, 1990, 2008), McGee (1992, 2004), Gómez-Torrente (1996, 1998/9, 2008, 2009), Ray (1996), Sher (1996), Hanson (1997), Sagüillo (1997), Chihara (1998), Shapiro (1998), Schurz (1999), Blanchette (2000), Bays (2001), Edwards (2003), Jané (2006), Mancosu (2006, 2010), and the entries on  logical consequence and  logical truth. The Tarskian ideas on logical constants are discussed, among other places, in Simons (1987), Sher (1991), (2008), Feferman (1999), Gómez-Torrente (2002), Bellotti (2003), Casanovas (2007), Bonnay (2008), (2014), Dutilh Novaes (2014), Sagi (forthcoming), and the entry on   logical constants. The literature on general philosophical aspects of Tarski’s work and opinions includes Suppes (1988), Woleński (1993), Sinaceur (2001), Feferman (2004b), Mycielski (2004), Mancosu (2005, 2009), Betti (2008) and Frost-Arnold (2008, 2013).
