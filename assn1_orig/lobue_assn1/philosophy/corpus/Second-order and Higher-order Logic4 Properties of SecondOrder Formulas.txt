 Many syntactic operations that we are used to in first order logic work equally well in second-order logic. One such is the operation of relativization, in which we want to limit what a formula expresses to a fixed part of the universe. For example, we may consider models where a certain unary predicate U is used for the set of natural numbers. Then we relativize our axioms of arithmetic to the predicate U. Some other part of the model may be used for the power set of the set of natural numbers. Then we relativize our axioms of power set (see  §5.3)  to that part, and so on. If \(\mm\) is a structure and \(A\subseteq M\), then \(\mm^{A}\) is obtained by restricting the relations \(R^\mm\) and functions \(F^\mm\) to A. This does not always result in a structure but if it does, it is called the relativization of \(\mm\) to A. Suppose \(\phi=\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n,X_1,\ldots,X_m,F_1,\ldots,F_k)\) is a second-order formula and U is a unary relation variable. There is a second-order formula \(\phi^{U}\), the relativization of \(\phi\) to U, such that for all \(\mm\) for which \(\mm^{U^\mm}\) is a structure: Intuitively, \(\phi^{U}\) says about \(U^\mm\) what \(\phi\) says about M. To obtain \(\phi^{U}\) from \(\phi\) one restricts all the first order quantifiers to elements of U and second-order quantifiers to subsets, relations and functions on U. Hierarchies based on quantifier structure are a useful method to compare the definability of concepts in different systems. In first order logic it was observed very early on that formulas can be brought into a logically equivalent Prenex Normal Form in which all quantifiers occur in the beginning of the formula. This is possible also in second-order logic and the proof is essentially the same. Moreover, using the equivalence (which is reminiscent of a principle of set theory called Axiom of Choice, to which we return in Section 5.4., since in the below formula the relation \(Y\) in a sense chooses one \(X\) for each \(x\) and puts them together into one relation \(Y\) – see entry on  Axiom of Choice  for more on the topic.) where the arity of Y is one higher than the arity of X, and \(\phi'\) is obtained from \(\phi\) by replacing everywhere \(X(t_1,\ldots,t_n)\) by \(Y(x,t_1,\ldots,t_n)\), one can bring every second-order logic formula to a logically equivalent normal form where each \(Q_i\) is either \(\exists\) or \(\forall\) and \(\phi\) is first order. Table 1: The hierarchy of second-order formulas. By restricting what kind of quantifiers the sequence \(Q_1X_1\ldots Q_nX_n\) of the Prenex Normal Form (\ref{qqq}) can contain we obtain the classes of \(\Sigma^1_n\)-, \(\Pi^1_n\)- and \(\Delta^1_n\)-formulas, as indicated in  Table 1.  For example, the second-order formulas (1) and (2) are \(\Pi^1_1\)-formulas. We have considered above only quantifiers that bind relation variables but the situation is exactly the same if we had bound function variables. These classes of formulas have some obvious closure properties: They are all closed, up to logical equivalence, under \(\land , \lor\), and first order quantifiers. Moreover, the hierarchy is proper in the sense that for all \(n\ge 1\) which can be proved with a diagonalisation argument. The classes \(\Delta^1_n\) are closed under \(\land , \lor, \neg\) and first order quantifiers. By Craig’s Interpolation Theorem, \(\Delta^1_1\)-formulas are logically equivalent to first order formulas  [2]. There is a sense in which \(\Pi^1_1\), or equivalently \(\Sigma^1_1\), already has the full power of second-order logic, although the above hierarchy result (\ref{kurat}) shows that this cannot literally be true. To see this, i.e., to see what the reduction of second-order logic to its \(\Pi^1_1\)-part means, let L be a vocabulary, E a binary and U a unary relation symbol, both not in L. Let \(\theta\) be the second-order \(\Pi^1_1\)-formula where It is easy to  see[3]  that models of \(\theta\) are, up to isomorphism, models \(\mm\) where \(M=U^\mm\cup\P(U^\mm)\), \(U^\mm\cap\P(U^\mm)=\emptyset\) and for all \(a,b\in M\), \(E^\mm(a,b)\leftrightarrow a\in b\). In such a model monadic second-order formulas \(\phi\) over \(U^\mm\) can be reduced to first order formulas \(\phi^*\) over M. This reduction, due to Hintikka (1955) and further developed by Montague (1963), shows that \(\Pi^1_1\)-formulas alone are enough to express any second-order property with extra predicates. The idea can be extended to third and higher order logic. As a consequence, checking the validity of a second-order sentence \(\phi\) can be recursively reduced to checking the validity of the \(\Sigma^1_1\)-sentence \(\theta\to\phi^*\). Likewise checking whether a second-order sentence \(\phi\) has a model of cardinality \(\kappa\) can be reduced to asking whether the \(\Pi^1_1\)-sentence \(\theta\land\phi^*\) has a model of cardinality \(2^\kappa\). This means that the Löwenheim  number[4]  and the Hanf  number[5]  of the entire second-order logic are the same as those of the fragment \(\Pi^1_1\). Summing up, upon first inspection the levels \(\Sigma^1_n\) and \(\Pi^1_n\) of the hierarchy of second-order formulas grow strictly in expressive power as n increases, but a more careful analysis reveals that already the first level \(\Sigma^1_1\cup \Pi^1_1\) has the power of all the levels \(\Sigma^1_n, \Pi^1_n\) even if the power is somewhat implicit and needs to be brought to light. In set theory there is the Levy-hierarchy of \(\Sigma_n\)- and \(\Pi_n\)-formulas (Lévy 1965). Formulas where all quantifiers are bounded, i.e., of the form \(\forall x\in y\) or of the form \(\exists x\in y\) for some x and y, are called \(\Sigma_0\) or equivalently \(\Pi_0\). Formulas of the form \(\forall x\,\phi\), where \(\phi\) is \(\Sigma_n\), are called \(\Pi_{n+1}\). Formulas of the form \(\exists x\,\phi\), where \(\phi\) is \(\Pi_n\), are called \(\Sigma_{n+1}\). This is a strict hierarchy roughly for the same reason why the hierarchy of second-order \(\Sigma^1_n\)- and \(\Pi^1_n\)-formulas is strict. But there is no known method to reduce the truth of an arbitrary formula to the truth of a formula on the \(\Sigma_1\cup\Pi_1\) level. In fact, if the decision problem, Löwenheim-Skolem number and Hanf number are suitably defined for \(\Sigma_n\cup \Pi_n\)-formulas of set theory, the decision problem gets more and more complicated, and the numbers obtained get bigger and bigger as n increases (see  Theorem 4;  Väänänen 1979). The hierarchy \(\Sigma_n^1\cup \Pi_n^1\) inside second-order logic and the hierarchy \(\Sigma_n\cup\Pi_n\) in set theory, are compared to each other in  §7.
