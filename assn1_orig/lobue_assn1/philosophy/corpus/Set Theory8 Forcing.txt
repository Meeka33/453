 In 1963, twenty-five years after Gödel’s proof of the consistency of the CH and the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF, Paul Cohen (1966) proved the consistency of the negation of the CH, and also of the negation of the AC, relative to the consistency of ZF. Thus, if ZF is consistent, then the CH is undecidable in ZFC, and the AC is undecidable in ZF.  To achieve this, Cohen devised a new and extremely powerful technique, called forcing, for expanding countable transitive models of ZF. Since the axiom \(V=L\) implies the AC and the CH, any model of the negation of the AC or the CH must violate \(V=L\). So, let’s illustrate the idea of forcing in the case of building a model for the negation of \(V=L\). We start with a transitive model \(M\) of ZFC, which we may assume, without loss of generality, to be a model of \(V=L\). To violate \(V=L\) we need to expand \(M\) by adding a new set \(r\) so that, in the expanded model, \(r\) will be non-constructible. Since all hereditarily-finite sets are constructible, we aim to add an infinite set of natural numbers. The first problem we face is that \(M\) may contain already all subsets of \(\omega\). Fortunately, by the Löwenheim-Skolem theorem for first-order logic, \(M\) has a countable elementary submodel \(N\). So, since we are only interested in the statements that hold in \(M\), and not in \(M\) itself, we may as well work with \(N\) instead of \(M\), and so we may assume that \(M\) itself is countable. Then, since \(\mathcal{P}(\omega)\) is uncountable, there are plenty of subsets of \(\omega\) that do not belong to \(M\). But, unfortunately, we cannot just pick any infinite subset \(r\) of \(\omega\) that does not belong to \(M\) and add it to \(M\). The reason is that \(r\) may encode a lot of information, so that when added to \(M\), \(M\) is no longer a model of ZFC, or it is still a model of \(V=L\). To avoid this, one needs to pick \(r\) with great care. The idea is to pick \(r\) generic over \(M\), meaning that \(r\) is built from its finite approximations in such a way that it does not have any property that is definable in \(M\) and can be avoided. For example, by viewing \(r\) as an infinite sequence of natural numbers in the increasing order, the property of \(r\) containing only finitely-many even numbers can be avoided, because given any finite approximation to \(r\)—i.e., any finite increasing sequence of natural numbers—one can always extend it by adding more even numbers, so that at the end of the construction \(r\) will contain infinitely-many even numbers; while the property of containing the number 7 cannot be avoided, because when a finite approximation to \(r\) contains the number 7, then it stays there no matter how the construction of \(r\) proceeds. Since \(M\) is countable, there are such generic \(r\). Then the expanded model \(M[r]\), which includes \(M\) and contains the new set \(r\), is called a generic extension of \(M\). Since we assumed \(M\) is a transitive model of \(V=L\), the model \(M[r]\) is just \(L_\alpha (r)\), where \(\alpha\) is the supremum of the ordinals of \(M\). Then one can show, using the forcing relation between finite approximations to \(r\) and formulas in the language of set theory expanded with so-called names for sets in the generic extension, that \(M[r]\) is a model of ZFC and \(r\) is not constructible in \(M[r]\), hence the axiom of constructibility \(V=L\) fails. In general, a forcing extension of a model \(M\) is obtained by adding to \(M\) a generic subset \(G\) of some partially ordered set \(\mathbb{P}\) that belongs to \(M\). In the above example, \(\mathbb{P}\) would be the set of all finite increasing sequences of natural numbers, seen as finite approximations to the infinite sequence \(r\), ordered by \(\subseteq\); and \(G\) would be the set of all finite initial segments of \(r\). In the case of the consistency proof of the negation of the CH, one starts from a model \(M\) and adds \(\aleph_2\) new subsets of \(\omega\), so that in the generic extension the CH fails. In this case one needs to use an appropriate partial ordering \(\mathbb{P}\) so that the \(\aleph_2\) of \(M\) is not collapsed, i.e., it is the same as the \(\aleph_2\) of the generic extension, and thus the generic extension \(M[G]\) will satisfy the sentence that says that there are \(\aleph_2\) real numbers. Besides the CH, many other mathematical conjectures and problems about the continuum, and other infinite mathematical objects, have been shown undecidable in ZFC using the forcing technique. One important example is Suslin’s Hypothesis (SH). Cantor had shown that every linearly ordered set \(S\) without endpoints that is dense (i.e., between any two different elements of \(S\) there is another one), complete (i.e., every subset of \(S\) that is bounded above has a supremum), and with a countable dense subset is isomorphic to the real line. Suslin conjectured that this is still true if one relaxes the requirement of containing a countable dense subset to being ccc, i.e., every collection of pairwise-disjoint intervals is countable. In the early 1970s, Thomas Jech produced a consistent counterexample using forcing, and Ronald Jensen showed that a counterexample exists in \(L\). About the same time, Robert Solovay and Stanley Tennenbaum (1971) developed and used for the first time the iterated forcing technique to produce a model where the SH holds, thus showing its independence from ZFC. In order to make sure that the SH holds in the generic extension, one needs to destroy all counterexamples, but by destroying one particular counterexample one may inadvertently create new ones, and so one needs to force again and again; in fact one needs to go on for at least \(\omega_2\)-many steps. This is why a forcing iteration is needed. Among other famous mathematical problems that have been shown undecidable in ZFC thanks to the forcing technique, especially using iterated forcing and sometimes combined with large cardinals, we may mention the Measure Problem and the Borel Conjecture in measure theory, Kaplansky’s Conjecture on Banach algebras, and Whitehead’s Problem in group theory.
