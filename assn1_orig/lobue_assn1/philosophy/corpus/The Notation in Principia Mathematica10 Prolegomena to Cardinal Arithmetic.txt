 Although students of philosophy usually read no further than ∗20 in PM, this is in fact the point where the “construction” of mathematics really begins. ∗21 presents the “General Theory of Relations” (the theory of relations in extension; in contemporary logic these are treated as sets of ordered pairs, following Wiener). \(\hat{x} \hat{y} \psi(x, y)\) is the relation between \(x\) and \(y\) which obtains when \(\psi(x, y)\) is true. In modern notation we represent this as as the set of ordered pairs \(\{\langle x, y \rangle \mid \psi( x, y ) \}\), which is read: the set of ordered pairs \(\langle x, y \rangle\) which are such that \(x\) bears the relation \(\psi\) to \(y\). The following contextual definition (∗21·01) allows one to eliminate the relation term \(\hat{x} \hat{y}\psi (x, y)\) from occurrences in the context \(f\): or in modern notation: where \(\phi\) is a predicative function of \(u\) and \(v\). Principia does not analyze relations (or mathematical functions) in terms of sets of ordered pairs, but rather takes the notion of propositional function as primitive and defines relations and functions in terms of them. The upper case letters \({R}, {S}\) and \({T}\), etc., are used after ∗21 to stand for these “relations in extension”, and are distinguished from propositional functions by being written between the arguments. Thus it is \(\psi(x,y)\) with arguments after the propositional function symbol, but \(xRy\). From ∗21 functions “\(\phi\) and \(\psi\)”, etc., disappear and only relations in extension, \({R}\), \({S}\) and \({T}\), etc., appear in the pages of  Principia . While propositional functions might be true of the same objects yet not be identical, no two relations in extension are true of the same objects. The logic of Principia is thus “extensional”, from page 200 in volume I, through to the end in Volume III. ∗22 on the “Calculus of Classes” presents the elementary set theory of intersections, unions and the empty set which is often all the set theory used in elementary mathematics of other sorts. The student looking for the set theory of Principia to compare it with, say the Zermelo-Fraenkel system, will have to look at various numbers later in the text. The Axiom of Choice is defined at ∗88 as the “Multiplicative Axiom” and a version of the Axiom of Infinity appears at ∗120 in Volume II as “Infin ax”. The set theory of Principia comes closest to Zermelo’s axioms of 1908 among the various familiar axiom systems, which means that it lacks the Axiom of Foundation and Axiom of Replacement of the now standard Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms of set theory.  The system of Principia differs importantly from Zermelo’s in that it is formulated in the simple theory of types. As a result, for example, there are no quantifiers ranging over all sets, and there is a set of all things (for each type). ∗30 on “Descriptive Functions” provides Whitehead and Russell’s analysis of mathematical functions in terms of relations and definite descriptions. Frege had used the notion of function, in the mathematical sense, as a basic notion in his logical system. Thus a Fregean “concept” is a function from objects as arguments to one of the two “truth values” as its values. A concept yields the value “True” for each object to which the concept applies, and “False” for all others. Russell, from 1904, well before the writing of Principia had preferred to analyze functions in terms of the relation between each argument and value, and the notion of “uniqueness”. With modern symbolism, his view would be expressed as follows. For each function \(\lambda x f(x)\), there will be some relation (in extension) \(R\), such that the value of the function for an argument \(a\), that is \(f(a)\), will be the unique individual which bears the relation \(R\) to \(a\). (Nowadays we reduce functions to a binary relation between the argument in the first place and value in the second place.) The result is that there are no function symbols in Principia. As Whitehead and Russell say, the familiar mathematical expressions such as “\(\sin \pi/2\)” will be analyzed with a relation and a definite description, as a “descriptive function”. The “descriptive function”, \(R‘y\) (the \(R\) of \(y)\), is defined as follows: We conclude this section by presenting a number of prominent examples from these later numbers below, with their intuitive meaning, location in PM, definition in PM, and a modern equivalent. (Some of these numbers are theorems rather than definitions.) Note, however, that the modern equivalent will sometimes logically differ from the original version in PM, such as by treating relations as sets of ordered pairs, etc. In his account of the logic of Principia, W.V. Quine (1951) objects to the complexity and even redundancy of much of this symbolism. These formulas can be worked out, however, with a step by step application of the definitions. For each formula number, we present the information in the following format:
