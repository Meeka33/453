 Russell introduced another hierarchy, that was not motivated by any formal paradoxes expressed in a formal system, but rather by the fear of “circularity” and by informal paradoxes similar to the paradox of the liar. If a man says “I am lying”, then we have a situation reminiscent of Russell’s paradox: a proposition which is equivalent to its own negation. Another informal such paradoxical situation is obtained if we define an integer to be the “least integer not definable in less than 100 words”. In order to avoid such informal paradoxes, Russell thought it necessary to introduce another kind of hierarchy, the so-called “ramified hierarchy”. The need for such a hierarchy is hinted in Appendix B of Russell 1903. Interestingly this is connected there to the question of the identity of equivalent propositions and of the logical product of a class of propositions. A thorough discussion can be found in Chapter 10 of Russell 1959. Since this notion of ramified hierarchy has been extremely influential in logic and especially proof theory, we describe it in some details. In order to further motivate this hierarchy, here is one example due to Russell. If we say Napoleon was Corsican. we do not refer in this sentence to any assemblage of properties. The property “to be Corsican” is said to be predicative. If we say on the other hand Napoleon had all the qualities of a great general we are referring to a totality of qualities. The property “to have all qualities of a great general” is said to be impredicative. Another example, also coming from Russell, shows how impredicative  properties can potentially lead to problems reminiscent  of the liar paradox. Suppose that we suggest the definition A typical Englishman is one who possesses all the properties possessed by a majority of Englishmen. It is clear that most Englishmen do not possess all the properties that most Englishmen possess. Therefore, a typical Englishman, according to this definition, should be untypical. The problem, according to Russell, is that the word “typical” has been defined by a reference to all properties and has been treated as itself a property. (It is remarkable that similar problems arise when defining the notion of random numbers, cf. Martin-Löf “Notes on constructive mathematics” (1970).) Russell introduced the ramified hierarchy in order to deal with the apparent circularity of such impredicative definitions. One should make a distinction between the first-order properties, like being Corsican, that do not refer to the totality of properties, and consider that the second-order properties refer only to the totality of first-order properties. One can then introduce third-order properties, that can refer to the totality of second-order property, and so on. This clearly eliminates all circularities connected to impredicative definitions. At about the same time, Poincaré carried out a similar analysis. He stressed the importance of “predicative” classifications, and of not defining elements of a class using a quantification over this class (Poincaré 1909). Poincaré used the following example. Assume that we have a collection with elements 0, 1 and an operation + satisfying Let us say that a property is inductive if it holds of  0 and holds for \(x+1\) if it holds for \(x\). An impredicative, and potentially “dangerous”, definition would be to define an element to be a number if it satisfies all inductive properties. It is then easy to show that this property “to be a number” is itself inductive. Indeed, 0 is a number since it satisfies all inductive properties, and if \(x\) satisfies all inductive properties then so does \(x+1\). Similarly it is easy to show that \(x+y\) is a number if \(x,y\) are numbers. Indeed the property \(Q(z)\) that \(x+z\) is a number is inductive: \(Q\)(0) holds since \(x+0=x\) and if \(x+z\) is a number then so is \(x+(z+1) = (x+z)+1\). This whole argument however is circular since the property “to be a number” is not predicative and should be treated with suspicion. Instead, one should introduce a ramified hierarchy of properties and numbers. At the beginning, one has only first-order inductive properties, which do not refer in their definitions to a totality of properties, and one defines the numbers of order 1 to be the elements satisfying all first-order inductive properties. One can next consider the second-order inductive properties, that can refer to the collection of first-order properties, and the numbers of order 2, that are the elements satisfying the inductive properties of order 2. One can then similarly consider numbers of order 3, and so on. Poincaré emphasizes the fact that a number of order 2 is a fortiori a number of order 1, and more generally, a number of order \(n+1\) is a fortiori a number of order \(n\). We have thus a sequence of more and more restricted properties: inductive properties of order 1, 2, … and a sequence of more and more restricted collections of objects: numbers of order 1, 2, … Also, the property “to be a number of order \(n\)” is itself an inductive property of order \(n+1\). It does not seem possible to prove that \(x+y\) is a number of order \(n\) if \(x,y\) are numbers of order \(n\). On the other hand, it is possible to show that if \(x\) is a number of order \(n+1\), and \(y\) a number of order \(n+1\) then \(x+y\) is a number of order \(n\). Indeed, the property \(P(z)\) that “\(x+z\) is a number of order \(n\)” is an inductive property of order \(n+1: P\)(0) holds since \(x+0 = x\) is a number of order \(n+1\), and hence of order \(n\), and if \(P(z)\) holds, that is if \(x+z\) is a number of order \(n\), then so is \(x+(z+1) = (x+z)+1\), and so \(P(z+1)\) holds. Since \(y\) is a number of order \(n+1\), and \(P(z)\) is an inductive property of order \(n+1, P(y)\) holds and so \(x+y\) is a number of order \(n\). This example illustrates well the complexities introduced by the ramified hierarchy. The complexities are further amplified if one, like Russell as for Frege, defines even basic objects like natural numbers as classes of classes. For instance the number 2 is defined as the class of all classes of individuals having exactly two elements. We again obtain natural numbers of different orders in the ramified hierarchy. Besides Russell himself, and despite all these complications, Chwistek tried to develop arithmetic in a ramified way, and the interest of such an analysis was stressed by Skolem. See Burgess and Hazen 1998 for a recent development. Another mathematical example, often given, of an impredicative definition is the definition of least upper bound of a bounded class of real numbers. If we identify a real with the set of rationals that are less than this real, we see that this least upper bound can be defined as the union of all elements in this class. Let us identify subsets of the rationals as predicates. For example, for rational numbers \(q, P(q)\) holds iff \(q\) is a member of the subset identified as \(P\). Now, we define the predicate \(L_C\) (a subset of the rationals) to be the least upper bound of class \(C\) as: which is impredicative: we have defined a predicate \(L\) by an existential quantification over all predicates. In the ramified hierarchy, if \(C\) is a class of first-order classes of rationals, then \(L\) will be a second-order class of rationals. One obtains then not one notion or real numbers, but real numbers of different orders 1, 2, … The least upper bound of a collection of reals of order 1 will then be at least of order 2 in general. As we saw earlier, yet another example of an impredicative definition is given by Leibniz’ definition of equality. For Leibniz, the predicate “is equal to \(a\)” is true for \(b\) iff \(b\) satisfies all the predicates satisfied by \(a\). How should one deal with the complications introduced by the ramified hierarchy? Russell showed, in the introduction to the second edition to  Principia Mathematica,  that these complications can be avoided in some cases. He even thought, in Appendix B of the second edition of Principia Mathematica, that the ramified hierarchy of natural numbers of order 1,2,… collapses at order 5. However, Gödel later found a problem in his argument, and indeed, it was shown by Myhill 1974 that this hierarchy actually does not collapse at any finite level. A similar problem, discussed by Russell in the introduction to the second edition to  Principia Mathematica  arises in the proof of Cantor’s theorem that there cannot be any injective functions from the collection of all predicates to the collection of all objects (the version of Russell’s paradox in Frege’s system that we presented in the introduction). Can this be done in a ramified hierarchy? Russell doubted that this could be done within a ramified hierarchy of predicates and this was indeed confirmed indeed later (Heck 1996). Because of these problems, Russell and Whitehead introduced in the first edition of Principia Mathematica the following reducibility axiom: the hierarchy of predicates, first-order, second-order, etc., collapses at level 1. This means that for any predicate of any order, there is a predicate of the first-order level which is equivalent to it. In the case of equality for instance, we postulate a first-order relation “\(a=b\)” which is equivalent to “\(a\) satisfies all properties that \(b\) satisfies”. The motivation for this axiom was purely pragmatic. Without it, all basic mathematical notions, like real or natural numbers are stratified into different orders. Also, despite the apparent circularity of impredicative definitions, the axiom of reducibility does not seem to lead to inconsistencies. As noticed however first by Chwistek, and later by Ramsey, in the presence of the axiom of reducibility, there is actually no point in introducing the ramified hierarchy at all! It is much simpler to accept impredicative definitions from the start. The simple “extensional” hierarchy of individuals, classes, classes of classes, … is then enough. We get in this way the simpler systems formalised in Gödel 1931 or Church 1940 that were presented above. The axiom of reducibility draws attention to the problematic status of impredicative definitions. To quote Weyl 1946, the axiom of reducibility “is a bold, an almost fantastic axiom; there is little justification for it in the real world in which we live, and none at all in the evidence on which our mind bases its constructions”! So far, no contradictions have been found using the reducibility axiom. However, as we shall see below, proof-theoretic investigations confirm the extreme strength of such a principle. The idea of the ramified hierarchy has been extremely important in mathematical logic. Russell considered only the finite iteration of the hierarchy: first-order, second-order, etc., but from the beginning, the possibility of extending the ramification transfinitely was considered. Poincaré (1909) mentions the work of Koenig in this direction. For the example above of numbers of different order, he also defines a number to be inductive of order \(\omega\) if it is inductive of all finite orders. He then points out that x+y is inductive of order \(\omega\) if both \(x\) and \(y\) are. This shows that the introduction of transfinite orders can in some case play the role of the axiom of reducibility. Such transfinite extension of the ramified hierarchy was analysed further by Gödel who noticed the key fact that the following form of the reducibility axiom is actually provable: when one extends the ramified hierarchy of properties over the natural numbers into the transfinite this hierarchy collapses at level \(\omega_1\), the least uncountable ordinal (Gödel 1995, and Prawitz 1970). Furthermore, while at all levels \(\lt \omega_1\), the collection of predicates is countable, the collection of predicates at level \(\omega_1\) is of cardinality \(\omega_1\). This fact was a strong motivation behind Gödel’s model of constructible sets. In this model the collection of all subsets of the set of natural numbers (represented by predicates) is of cardinality \(\omega_1\) and is similar to the ramified hierarchy. This model satisfies in this way the Continuum Hypothesis, and gives a relative consistency proof of this axiom. (The motivation of Gödel was originally only to build a model where the collection of all subsets of natural numbers is well-ordered.) The ramified hierarchy has been also the source of much work in proof theory. After the discovery by Gentzen that the consistency of Arithmetic could be proved by transfinite induction (over decidable predicates) along the ordinal \(\varepsilon_0\), the natural question was to find the corresponding ordinal for the different levels of the ramified hierarchy. Schütte (1960) found that for the first level of the ramified hierarchy, that is if we extend arithmetic by quantifying only over first-order properties, we get a system of ordinal strength \(\varepsilon_{\varepsilon_0}\). For the second level we get the ordinal strength \(\varepsilon_{\varepsilon_{ \varepsilon_0}}\), etc. We recall that \(\varepsilon_{\alpha}\) denotes the \(\alpha\)-th \(\varepsilon\)-ordinal number, an \(\varepsilon\)-ordinal number being an ordinal \(\beta\) such that \(\omega^{\beta} = \beta\), see Schütte (1960). Gödel stressed the fact that his approach to the problem of the continuum hypothesis was not constructive, since it needs the uncountable ordinal \(\omega_1\), and it was natural to study the ramified hierarchy along constructive ordinals. After preliminary works of Lorenzen and Wang, Schütte analysed what happens if we proceed in the following more constructive way. Since arithmetic has for ordinal strength \(\varepsilon_0\) we consider first the iteration of the ramified hierarchy up to \(\varepsilon_0\). Schütte computed the ordinal strength of the resulting system and found an ordinal strength \(u(1)\gt \varepsilon_0\). We iterate then ramified hierarchy up to this ordinal \(u(1)\) and get a system of ordinal strength \(u(2)\gt u(1)\), etc. Each \(u(k)\) can be computed in terms of the so-called Veblen hierarchy: \(u(k+1)\) is \(\phi_{u(k)}(0)\). The limit of this process gives an ordinal called \(\Gamma_0\): if we iterate the ramified hierarchy up to the ordinal \(\Gamma_0\) we get a system of ordinal strength \(\Gamma_0\). Such an ordinal was obtained independently about the same time by S. Feferman. It has been claimed that \(\Gamma_0\) plays for predicative systems a role similar to \(\varepsilon_0\) for Arithmetic. Recent proof-theoretical works however are concerned with systems having bigger proof-theoretical ordinals that can be considered predicative (see for instance Palmgren 1995). Besides these proof theoretic investigations related to the ramified hierarchy, much work has been devoted in proof theory to analysing the consistency of the axiom of reducibility, or, equivalently, the consistency of impredicative definitions. Following Gentzen’s analysis of the cut-elimination property in the sequent calculus, Takeuti found an elegant sequent formulation of simple type theory (without ramification) and made the bold conjecture that cut-elimination should hold for this system. This conjecture seemed at first extremely dubious given the circularity of impredicative quantification, which is well reflected in this formalism. The rule for quantifications is indeed where \(T\) is any term predicate, which may itself involve a quantification over all predicates. Thus the formula \(A[X:=T]\) may be itself much more complex than the formula \(A(X)\). One early result is that cut-elimination for Takeuti’s impredicative system implies in a finitary way the consistency of second-order Arithmetic. (One shows that this implies the consistency of a suitable form of infinity axiom, see Andrews 2002.) Following work by Schütte, it was later shown by W. Tait and D. Prawitz that indeed the cut-elimination property holds (the proof of this has to use a stronger proof theoretic principle, as it should be according to the incompleteness theorem.) What is important here is that these studies have revealed the extreme power of impredicative quantification or, equivalently, the extreme power of the axiom of reducibility. This confirms in some way the intuitions of Poincaré and Russell. The proof-theoretic strength of second-order Arithmetic is way above all ramified extensions of Arithmetic considered by Schütte. On the other hand, despite the circularity of impredicative definitions, which is made so explicit in Takeuti’s calculus, no paradoxes have been found yet in second-order Arithmetic. Another research direction in proof theory has been to understand how much of impredicative quantification can be explained from principles that are available in intuitionistic mathematics. The strongest such principles are strong forms of inductive definitions. With such principles, one can explain a limited form of an impredicative quantification, called \(\Pi_{1}^1\)-comprehension, where one uses only one level of impredicative quantification over predicates. Interestingly, almost all known uses of impredicative quantifications: Leibniz equality, least upper bound, etc., can be done with \(\Pi_{1}^1\)-comprehension. This reduction of \(\Pi_{1}^1\)-comprehension was first achieved by Takeuti in a quite indirect way, and was later simplified by Buchholz and Schütte using the so-called \(\Omega\)-rule. It can be seen as a constructive explanation of some restricted, but nontrivial, uses of impredicative definitions.
