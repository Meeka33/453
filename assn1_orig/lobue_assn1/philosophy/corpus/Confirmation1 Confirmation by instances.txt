 In a seminal essay on induction, Jean Nicod (1924) offered the following important remark: Consider the formula or the law: \(F\) entails \(G\). How can a particular proposition, or more briefly, a fact affect its probability? If this fact consists of the presence of \(G\) in a case of \(F\), it is favourable to the law […]; on the contrary, if it consists of the absence of \(G\) in a case of \(F\), it is unfavourable to this law. (219, notation slightly adapted) Nicod’s work was an influential source for Carl Gustav Hempel’s (1943, 1945) early studies in the logic of confirmation. In Hempel’s view, the key valid message of Nicod’s statement is that the observation report that an object \(a\) displays properties \(F\) and \(G\) (e.g., that \(a\) is a swan and is white) confirms the universal hypothesis that all \(F\)-objects are \(G\)-objects (namely, that all swans are white). Apparently, it is by means of this kind of confirmation by instances that one can obtain supporting evidence for statements such as “sodium salts burn yellow”, “wolves live in a pack”, or “planets move in elliptical orbits” (also see Russell 1912, Ch. 6). We will now see the essential features of Hempel’s analysis of confirmation. Hempel’s theory addresses the non-deductive relation of confirmation between evidence and hypothesis, but relies thoroughly on standard logic for its full technical formulation. As a consequence, it also goes beyond Nicod’s idea in terms of clarity and rigor. Let \(\bL\) be the set of the closed sentences of a first-order logical language \(L\) (finite, for simplicity) and consider \(h, e \in \bL\). Also let \(e\), the evidence statement, be consistent and contain individual constants only (no quantifier), and let \(I(e)\) be the set of all constants occurring (non-vacuously) in \(e\). So, for example, if \(e = Qa \wedge Ra\), then \(I(e) = \{a\}\), and if \(e = Qa \wedge Qb\), then \(I(e) = \{a,b\}\). (The non-vacuity clause is meant to ensure that if sentence \(e\) happens to be, say, \(Qa \wedge Qb \wedge (Rc \vee \neg Rc)\), then \(I(e)\) still is \(\{a, b\}\), for \(e\) does not really state anything non-trivial about the individual denoted by \(c\). See Sprenger 2011a, 241–242.) Hempel’s theory relies on the technical construct of the development of hypothesis \(h\) for evidence \(e\), or the \(e\)-development of \(h\), indicated by \(dev_{e}(h)\). Intuitively, \(dev_{e}(h)\) is all that (and only what) \(h\) says once restricted to the individuals mentioned (non-vacuously) in \(e\), i.e., exactly those denoted by the elements of \(I(e)\). The notion of the \(e\)-development of hypothesis \(h\) can be given an entirely general and precise definition, but we’ll not need this level of detail here. Suffice it to say that the \(e\)-development of a universally quantified material conditional \(\forall x(Fx \rightarrow Gx)\) is just as expected, that is: \(Fa \rightarrow Ga\) in case \(I(e) = \{a\}\); \((Fa \rightarrow Ga) \wedge (Fb \rightarrow Gb)\) in case \(I(e) = \{a,b\}\), and so on. Following Hempel, we will take universally quantified material conditionals as canonical logical representations of relevant hypotheses. So, for instance, we will count a statement of the form \(\forall x(Fx \rightarrow Gx)\) as an adequate rendition of, say, “all pieces of copper conduct electricity”. In Hempel’s theory, evidence statement \(e\) is said to confirm hypothesis \(h\) just in case it entails, not \(h\) in its full extension, but suitable instantiations of \(h\). The technical notion of the \(e\)-development of \(h\) is devised to identify precisely those relevant instantiations, that is, the consequences of \(h\) as restricted to the individuals involved in \(e\). More precisely, Hempelian confirmation can be defined as follows: In each of clauses (i) and (ii), Hempelian confirmation (disconfirmation, respectively) is a generalization of direct Hempelian confirmation (disconfirmation). To retrieve the latter as a special case of the former, one only has to posit \(s = h\) \((\neg h\), respectively, for disconfirmation). By direct Hempelian confirmation, evidence statement \(e\) that, say, object \(a\) is a white swan, \(swan(a) \wedge white(a)\), confirms hypothesis \(h\) that all swans are white, \(\forall x(swan(x) \rightarrow white(x))\), because the former entails the \(e\)-development of the latter, that is, \(swan(a) \rightarrow white(a)\). This is a desired result, according to Hempel’s reading of Nicod. By (indirect) Hempelian confirmation, moreover, \(swan(a) \wedge white(a)\) also confirms that a particular further object \(b\) will be white, if it’s a swan, i.e., \(swan(b) \rightarrow white(b)\) (to see this, just set \(s = \forall x(swan(x) \rightarrow white(x))\)). The second possibility considered by Nicod (“the absence of \(G\) in a case of \(F\,\)”) can be accounted for by Hempelian disconfirmation. For the evidence statement \(e\) that \(a\) is a non-white swan—\(swan(a) \wedge \neg white(a)\)—entails (in fact, is identical to) the \(e\)-development of the hypothesis that there exist non-white swans—\(\exists x(swan(x) \wedge \neg white(x))\)—which in turn is just the negation of \(\forall x(swan(x) \rightarrow white(x))\). So the latter is disconfirmed by the evidence in this case. And finally, \(e = swan(a) \wedge \neg white(a)\) also Hempel-disconfirms that a particular further object \(b\) will be white, if it’s a swan, i.e., \(swan(b) \rightarrow white(b)\), because the negation of the latter, \(swan(b) \wedge \neg white(b)\), is entailed by \(s = \forall x(swan(x) \wedge \neg white(x))\) and \(e \vDash dev_{e}(s)\). So, to sum up, we have four illustrations of how Hempel’s theory articulates Nicod’s basic ideas, to wit: The ravens paradox (Hempel 1937, 1945). Consider the following statements: Is hypothesis \(h\) confirmed by \(e\) and \(e^*\) alike? That is, is the claim that all ravens are black equally confirmed by the observation of a black raven and by the observation of a non-black non-raven (e.g., a green apple)? One would want to say no, but Hempel’s theory is unable to draw this distinction. Let’s see why. As we know, \(e\) (directly) Hempel-confirms \(h\), according to Hempel’s reconstruction of Nicod. By the same token, \(e^*\) (directly) Hempel-confirms the hypothesis that all non-black objects are non-ravens, i.e., \(h^* = \forall x(\neg black(x) \rightarrow \neg raven(x))\). But \(h^* \vDash h\) (\(h\) and \(h^*\) are just logically equivalent). So, \(e^*\) (the observation report of a non-black non-raven), like \(e\) (black raven), does (indirectly) Hempel-confirm \(h\) (all ravens are black). Indeed, as \(\neg raven(a)\) entails \(raven(a) \rightarrow black(a)\), it can be shown that \(h\) is (directly) Hempel-confirmed by the observation of any object that is not a raven (an apple, a cat, a shoe), apparently disclosing puzzling “prospects for indoor ornithology” (Goodman 1955, 71). \(Blite\) (Goodman 1955). Consider the peculiar predicate “\(blite\)”, defined as follows: an object is blite just in case (i) it is black if examined at some moment \(t\) up to some future time \(T\) (say, the next expected appearance of Halley’s comet, in 2061) and (ii) it is white if examined afterwards. So we posit \(blite(x) \equiv (ex_{t\le T}(x) \rightarrow black(x)) \wedge (\neg ex_{t\le T}(x) \rightarrow white(x))\). Now consider the following statements: Does \(e\) confirm hypotheses \(h\) and \(h^*\) alike? That is, does the observation of a black raven before \(T\) confirms equally the claim that all ravens are black as the claim that all ravens are blite? Here again, one would want to say no, but Hempel’s theory is unable to draw the distinction. For one can check that the \(e\)-developments of \(h\) and \(h^*\) are both entailed by \(e\). Thus, \(e\) (the report of a raven examined no later than \(T\) and found to be black) does Hempel-confirm \(h^*\) (all ravens are blite) just as it confirms \(h\) (all ravens are black). Moreover, \(e\) also Hempel-confirms the statement that a raven will be white if examined after \(T\), because this is a logical consequence of \(h^*\) (which is directly Hempel-confirmed by \(e\)). And finally, suppose that \(blurple(x) \equiv (ex_{t\le T}(x) \rightarrow black(x)) \wedge (\neg ex_{t\le T}(x) \rightarrow purple(x)).\) We then have that the very same evidence statement \(e\) Hempel-confirms the hypothesis that all ravens are blurple, and thus also its implication that a raven will be \(purple\) if examined after \(T\)! A seemingly obvious idea, here, is that there must be something inherently wrong with predicates such as \(blite\) or \(blurple\) (and perhaps non-raven and non-black, too) and thus a principled way to rule them out as “unnatural”. Then one could restrict confirmation theory accordingly, i.e., to “natural kinds” only (see, e.g., Quine 1970). Yet this point turns out be very difficult to pursue coherently and it has not borne much fruit in this discussion (Rinard 2014 is a recent exception). After all, for all we know, it is a perfectly “natural” feature of a token of the “natural kind” water that it is found in one physical state for temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius and in an entirely different state for temperatures above that threshold. So why should the time threshold \(T\) in \(blite\) or \(blurple\) be a reason to dismiss those predicates? (The water example comes from Howson 2000, 31–32. See Schwartz 2011, 399 ff., for a more general assessment of this issue.) The above, widely known “paradoxes” then suggest that Hempel’s analysis of confirmation is too liberal: it sanctions the existence of confirmation relations that are intuitively very unsound (see Earman and Salmon 1992, 54, and Sprenger 2011a, 243, for more on this). Yet the Hempelian notion of confirmation turns out to be very restrictive, too, on other accounts. For suppose that hypothesis \(h\) and evidence \(e\) do not share any piece of non-logical vocabulary. \(h\) might be, say, Newton’s law of universal gravitation (connecting force, distances and masses), while \(e\) could be the description of certain spots on a telescopic image. Throughout modern physics, significant relations of confirmation and disconfirmation were taken to obtain between statements like these. Indeed, telescopic sightings have been crucial evidence for Newton’s law as applied to celestial bodies. However, as their non-logical vocabularies are disjoint, \(e\) and \(h\) must simply be logically independent, and so must be \(e\) and \(dev_{e}(h)\) (with very minor caveats, this follows from Craig’s so-called interpolation theorem, see Craig 1957). In such circumstances, there can be nothing but Hempel-neutrality between evidence and hypothesis. So Hempel’s original theory seems to lack the resources to capture a key feature of inductive inference in science as well as in several other domains, i.e., the kind of “vertical” relationships of confirmation (and disconfirmation) between the description of observed phenomena and hypotheses concerning underlying structures, causes, and processes. To overcome the latter difficulty, Clark Glymour (1980a) embedded a refined version of Hempelian confirmation by instances in his analysis of scientific reasoning. In Glymour’s revision, hypothesis \(h\) is confirmed by some evidence \(e\) even if appropriate auxiliary hypotheses and assumptions must be involved for \(e\) to entail the relevant instances of \(h\). This important theoretical move turns confirmation into a three-place relation concerning the evidence, the target hypothesis, and (a conjunction of) auxiliaries. Originally, Glymour presented his sophisticated neo-Hempelian approach in stark contrast with the competing traditional view of so-called hypothetico-deductivism (HD). Despite his explicit intentions, however, several commentators have pointed out that, partly because of the due recognition of the role of auxiliary assumptions, Glymour’s proposal and HD end up being plagued by similar difficulties (see, e.g., Horwich 1983, Woodward 1983, and Worrall 1982). In the next section, we will discuss the HD framework for confirmation and also compare it with Hempelian confirmation. It will thus be convenient to have a suitable extended definition of the latter, following the remarks above. Here is one that serves our purposes: One can see that in the above definition the auxiliary assumptions in \(k\) are the \(e\)-development of further closed constant-free hypotheses (in fact, equations as applied to specific measured values, in typical examples from Glymour 1980a), where such hypotheses are meant to be conjoined in a single statement (\(\alpha\)) for convenience. This implies that the only terms occurring (non-vacuously) in \(k\) are individual constants already occurring (non-vacuously) in \(e\). For an empty \(\alpha\) (that is, tautologous: \(\alpha = \top\)), \(k\) must be empty too, and the original (restricted) definition of Hempelian confirmation applies. As for the proviso that \(\alpha \not\vDash h\), it rules out undesired cases of circularity—akin to so-called “macho” bootstrap confirmation, as discussed in Earman and Glymour 1988 (for more on Glymour’s theory and its developments, see Douven and Meijs 2006, and references therein).
