 Most extant versions of neutral monism seem to acknowledge that, in addition to the basic neutral entities, there exist derivative, non-basic, and non-neutral entities—mental and physical entities, for example. This raises the question about the relationship between these two kinds of entities. Every answer to this question faces two challenges. On the one hand there is the threat of elimination of the non-basic entities (see section  7.1);  on the other hand there is the threat that the non-basic, non-neutral entities turn into elements of ultimate reality, thereby putting an end to neutral monism. The question of the relationship between basic and non-basic entities features prominently in Russell’s thought. The method of logical construction (see section  4.3.1)  is his answer to this question. The two other traditional neutral monists—Mach and James—can arguably be characterized as reductionists (for an attempt to develop this claim a little further, see the supplement  Reducing Mind and Matter to Neutral Entities).  The contemporary discussion of this question is most vigorously addressed by various philosophers in the Russellian monist camp (see section  5.5).  There is considerable agreement that the basic neutral entities are related to the non-basic, non-neutral entities by way of the grounding relation. But many questions remain about the precise nature of the relata of the relevant grounding relations (see section  5.5).
