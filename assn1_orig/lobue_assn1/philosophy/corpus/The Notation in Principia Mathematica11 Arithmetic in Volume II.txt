 Volume II of Principia Mathematica begins with Part III, “Cardinal Arithmetic”. The notions of cardinal numbers are developed in full generality, extending to infinite cardinals. Consequently the theory of natural numbers, which are called “Inductive Cardinals” in PM, is introduced with a series of definitions of special cases of notions that are first introduced in a general form applying to any numbers or classes. For example, addition of natural numbers, as in the famous proof that 1 + 1 = 2 in ∗110·04 is proved with for the special case of the addition of classes that applies to cardinal numbers, ‘\(+_c\)’. These definitions, concluding with the appearance of the Axiom of Infinity at ∗120·03 will conclude this introduction to the symbolism of Principia Mathematica. The reader can now appreciate why this elementary theorem is not proved until page 83 of Volume II of PM: \[\tag*{∗110·643}    1 +_c 1 = 2 \]   Whitehead and Russell remark that “The above proposition is occasionally useful. It is used at least three times, in …”. This joke reminds us that the theory of natural numbers, so central to Frege’s works, appears in PM as only a special case of a general theory of cardinal and ordinal numbers and even more general classes of isomorphic structures.  This survey of the notation in PM concludes with the definition of the natural numbers and a statement of the Axiom of Infinity, which allow the proof of the other axioms of Peano Arithmetic as, again, special cases of more general notions.   NC induct (the Inductive Cardinals)         [∗120·01]      \(\hat{\alpha}\{\alpha({+_c}1)_* 0\} \)      \(\{x \mid 0 S^* x\}\)    The inductive cardinals are the “natural numbers”, are 0 and all those cardinal numbers that are related to 0 by the ancestral of the “successor relation” \(S\), where \(xSy\) just in case \(y = x +1\).   Infin ax (the Axiom of Infinity)         [∗120·03]      \(\alpha \in \text{NC induct} \sdot \supset_{\alpha} \sdot \exists!\alpha\)      \(\forall y (\{x \mid 0S^* x\} \supset y \neq \varnothing) \)    The Axiom of Infinity asserts that all inductive cardinals are non-empty. (Recall that 0 = \(\{ \varnothing \}\), and so 0 is not empty.) The Axiom of Infinity is not a “primitive proposition” but instead to be listed as an “hypothesis” where used, that is as the antecedent of a conditional, where the consequent will be said to depend on the axiom. Technically it is not an axiom of PM as [∗120·03] is a definition, so this is just further notation in PM! Whitehead and Russell remark that “The above proposition is occasionally useful. It is used at least three times, in …”. This joke reminds us that the theory of natural numbers, so central to Frege’s works, appears in PM as only a special case of a general theory of cardinal and ordinal numbers and even more general classes of isomorphic structures. This survey of the notation in PM concludes with the definition of the natural numbers and a statement of the Axiom of Infinity, which allow the proof of the other axioms of Peano Arithmetic as, again, special cases of more general notions.
