 Bolzano strove for objectivity in “pure logic” in the sense that the concepts and laws of logic are mind-independent. In “applied logic”, in particular in epistemology, however, we have to take into account also the real, i.e., empirical, conditions of the human mind and thinking according to Bolzano (WL I, 66 f.). Nevertheless, he defined  the basic concepts of epistemology primarily on the level of ideas and propositions. This gave rise to the misunderstanding that his investigations are worthless for epistemology proper or even that there is no epistemology proper at all in Bolzano’s work. The fact that this is by no means the case, will — hopefully — emerge from the following survey of Bolzano’s epistemology. In epistemology, we are primarily and directly not concerned with propositions and ideas, but rather with their appearances (Erscheinungen) in the minds of thinking beings (“im Gemüt von geistigen bzw. denkenden Wesen”). One and the same proposition or idea can, as Bolzano says, appear in the minds of different thinking beings or also at different times in the mind of one and the same thinking being, without thereby being multiplied (WL I, 217, WL III, 13, 112). Bolzano says, in such a case, that the thinking being and its mind “grasp” the proposition or idea in question (the corresponding German word being ‘erfassen’ or ‘auffassen’). What happens in such a case is that in the mind of the thinking being under consideration a mental phenomenon occurs, or a mental process takes place in it, that is called by Bolzano a ‘Gedanke’ (‘thought’); it can be a subjective idea or a subjective proposition, depending on whether an idea or a proposition “appears” in it. In contrast to ideas and propositions (i.e., “objective” ideas and “objective” propositions), subjective ideas and subjective propositions belong to the real world, in particular to World 2 of mental phenomena and mental processes. For Bolzano, a subjective idea as well as a subjective proposition is a real property (or “adherence”) of the thinking being in whose mind it appears, or rather of this being’s mind or “soul” itself (WL III, 6, 10 f., 109). A subjective idea is a mental phenomenon — i.e., an attribute of a mind — that “grasps” an idea (in the “objective” sense of the word); and a mental phenomenon that “grasps” a proposition is called ‘Urteil’ (‘judgment’) by Bolzano (WL III, 108). In addition to judgments, there is a second kind of subjective propositions, viz. propositions that are “merely thought” (bloß gedacht); a “merely thought proposition” is in fact a subjective idea of a proposition, i.e. a mental phenomenon which grasps an idea whose object is a proposition (WL I, 155). Merely having a subjective idea of a proposition does not require that we assert the truth of the proposition in question, whereas a judgment is an act (Handlung) of asserting the truth of the proposition grasped by the judgment (WL III, 108, 199). When we say of a subjective idea or a judgment that it “grasps” an idea or proposition, respectively, the word ‘grasp’ is used in a more restrictive sense than before, where it was a thinking being or its mind of which it was said that it “grasps” an idea or proposition. This stricter relation of “grasping”, holding between subjective ideas and ideas, and between judgments and propositions is fundamental for Bolzano’s epistemology. Instead of saying in this sense ‘\(p\) grasps \(o\)’, Bolzano will synonymously also use the phrase ‘\(o\) is the “material” (Stoff) of \(p\)’. Both formulations, however, are — as Bolzano emphasizes — to be understood merely metaphorically (Bolzano 1935, 84 f.). The corresponding relation is introduced as a primitive concept in Bolzano’s epistemology. Let us use the symbol ‘\(\mathbf{G}\)’ for this relation, whereby ‘\(p \mathbf{G} o\)’ is to be read as ‘\(p\) grasps \(o\)’ or, alternatively, ‘\(o\) is the “material” of \(p\)’. In terms of ‘\(\mathbf{G}\)’, i.e., the strict relation of “grasping”, the weaker relation of “grasping” between a thinking being and an idea or proposition can be defined as follows: a thinking being \(x\) “grasps” (in the weaker sense of this word) an idea or proposition \(o\) iff there is a subjective idea or a judgment \(p\) in \(x\)’s mind such that \(p \mathbf{G} o\). The relation \(\mathbf{G}\) is the link between the mental phenomena of World 2 on the one hand and the World 3 of ideas and propositions on the other hand. Via relation \(\mathbf{G}\), items of World 3 can have a certain, non-causal influence on the mental phenomena of World 2, and these on their part stand in causal relations to other mental phenomena and also to the physical phenomena of World 1. Due to the domain and the range of \(\mathbf{G}\) being disjunctive sets, the relation \(\mathbf{G}\) has the following formal features: it is irreflexive, asymmetric, and (trivially) transitive; moreover, \(\mathbf{G}\) is many-one, but not one-many. Due to \(\mathbf{G}\)’s being many-one, by each subjective idea and each judgment an idea or a proposition, respectively, is uniquely determined as its material (WL III, 8 f., 108). Most of the important properties, relations and distinctions, which were defined by Bolzano primarily for ideas and propositions, can therefore easily be transferred from the sphere of ideas and propositions to the sphere of subjective ideas and judgments. We therefore will say of a subjective idea that it is simple or complex, empty, singular or general, an intuition, a concept or “mixed” according as the idea grasped by it has the corresponding property; and the same goes for judgments. An intuition is for Bolzano an idea that is simple and singular (cf. section 3.5). The question arises immediately whether such an intuition exists after all and — if so — what it can contribute to epistemology. Both questions are answered by Bolzano at once: In order to show that there are intuitions, he hints at subjective ideas (ideas in our minds) that grasp “objective” intuitions as defined before; and since these subjective intuitions exist in our actual world, the corresponding “objective” intuitions must exist (in the sense of ‘es gibt’) in the logical realm of World 3. What are the examples of subjective intuitions, however, that Bolzano can put forward in support of his claim? It is subjective ideas such as the subjective idea of the change in our mind that is the immediate reaction on an outer object (such as a rose) that stimulates our senses. In everyday language we usually express such an idea only by the word ‘that’ (‘dieses’ or — in Bolzano’s old-fashioned orthography — ‘dieß’). Bolzano’s rather long-winded explication (in WL I, 326 f.) reveals subjective ideas of a particular sensation or sense-datum as his favorite examples of subjective intuitions (cf. also WL III, 21 f.). The object and the cause of a subjective intuition of this kind is itself a mental phenomenon such as a subjective idea or a judgment (WL III, 85). If a subjective intuition is directly caused by an “outer” object, Bolzano calls it an ‘outer intuition’. Also in the case of an outer intuition, its proper object is not the “outer” cause of it but an “inner” mental event; human beings are capable only of having subjective intuitions whose proper object is a change in their mind (WL III, 89). In other passages Bolzano seems to be less cautious and claims also of an idea such as [Vesuvius] (WL II, 38) or [Socrates] (WL I, 346, in explicit contradiction to WL III, 89) to be a pure intuition whose appearance in the mind of a thinking being is a subjective intuition. This would obviously result in taking each rigid designator (in today’s terminology) to express an intuition. In the same way in which a subjective intuition is defined as a subjective idea that “grasps” (in the sense of \(\mathbf{G})\) an “objective” intuition, we can also define subjective concepts and “mixed” subjective ideas (WL III, 21–23). Using the distinction between intuitions and other ideas, Bolzano is now able to draw an important epistemological distinction among propositions and in particular also among true propositions: A proposition is a conceptual proposition iff it does not contain any intuition but consists exclusively of concepts, such as the propositions [God is omnipotent], [Gratefulness is a duty], or [\(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational]; all the other propositions are called ‘empirical propositions’ (or also ‘perceptual propositions’) by Bolzano, e.g. [That is a flower], or [Socrates was an Athenian] (WL II, 33 f.). There is no problem in transferring this distinction from the sphere of propositions to the sphere of judgments, since (as already mentioned) by every judgment a certain proposition is uniquely determined (via relation \(\mathbf{G})\) as its “material” (WL III, 115). At first glance, this objective distinction among propositions seems to be far away from the Kantian distinction between judgments a priori and a posteriori. Nevertheless, the two distinctions are closely interrelated, and they almost coincide (WL II, 36); hence, Bolzano warns against confusing them (WL IV, 451 f.). The close relationship of the two distinctions becomes obvious as soon as we ask ourselves how to discover of a conceptual or an empirical proposition whether or not it is true: In the case of conceptual propositions, it is mere reflection, i.e., an inner “inspection” of our subjective concepts, without any experience, that is required to find out whether or not it is true, whereas in the case of an empirical proposition experience is indispensable for judging its truth or falsity (WL II, 36). This Kantian distinction of the different ways of recognizing the truth or falsity of such judgments, however, as important as it is, must be based on the more fundamental objective distinction between conceptual and empirical propositions on Bolzano’s view. Empirical propositions contain at least one intuition. Most important are those empirical propositions whose subject idea is an intuition. These are propositions about perceptions or sensations, i.e., in Bolzano’s words, about certain changes in our minds, caused by other inner events or by external sensory stimuli. The subject idea of a “private” empirical proposition of this kind is usually expressed by a word such as ‘that’, denoting, e.g., a certain color sensation. No wonder that the indexicals ‘that’ and ‘I’ play such a prominent role in Bolzano’s epistemology (in WL III) although they do not have a place in his logical World 3 (cf. section 3.4). The reason for this seems to be that our empirical knowledge is based on immediate perceptual judgments, i.e., judgments that “grasp” (in the sense of \(\mathbf{G})\) a certain kind of an empirical proposition. The subjective subject idea of such an immediate perceptual judgment is a subjective intuition for whose expression an indexical such as ‘that’ or ‘I’ seems to be indispensable. Bolzano quite clearly faced the problem of how to get from these immediate perceptual judgments, whose objects are completely “private” phenomena which we usually denote by means of indexicals, to an objective description of our world. His epistemology therefore reminds us in many respects of the discussions concerning protocol sentences among the representatives of phenomenalism and physicalism in the Vienna Circle, and even more of Bertrand Russell’s program in his Inquiry into Meaning and Truth (1940). The highly interesting similarities between Bolzano’s and Russell’s program still await further investigation. Judgments are psychical phenomena and they belong therefore not to World 3 but to our real world. Each judgment is an act or event that takes place at a certain time in a certain mind and is herewith part of a causal network. As a part of our real world, each judgment comes into being in time (and will pass away later on). From an epistemological point of view it is of particular relevance whether a judgment is caused or mediated by other judgments or whether this is not the case, i.e., whether the judgment is “immediate” (WL III, 123 ff.). If a judgment \(m\) is caused or mediated by a set \(\mu\) of judgments, Bolzano calls the mind’s transition from \(\mu\) to \(m\) ‘Schluss’ (‘inference’), as distinct from the usage of this term explained in section 3.8. An inference in this sense is a mental process (belonging to World 2) of inferring a judgment \(m\) from a set \(\mu\) of others; we can represent it by \(\langle \mu , m\rangle\). Such an inference — as opposed to an “inference in itself” or an argument — is a causal process, to be clear. Since by each of the judgments involved in an inference — by the members of \(\mu\) as well as by \(m\) — a proposition is uniquely determined (due to \(\mathbf{G})\) as its “material”, by every inference \(\langle \mu , m\rangle\) an argument \(\langle \sigma , s\rangle\) is uniquely determined, for which Bolzano has defined what it means, e.g., that \(s\) is a logical consequence of \(\sigma\), or that \(s\) has a certain logical probability \(\gt \bfrac{1}{2}\) relative to \(\sigma\). (These concepts can then be applied indirectly to the inference \(\langle \mu , m\rangle\) and used for its evaluation, as we will see in the following section 4.5.) From the obvious existence of mediated judgments, however, it follows that there must also be immediate judgments (WL III, 125, 138–139). Immediate judgments cannot be false and must therefore be certain (WL III, 212, 229, 263). Certainty has thereby not to be taken in its objective sense in which a proposition \(s\) is certain relative to a set \(\sigma\) of propositions iff the logical probability of \(s\) relative to \(\sigma\) is 1, i.e., iff \(s\) is a logical consequence of \(\sigma\) (WL II, 173). In the present context, certainty must rather be taken in a subjective sense in which it is primarily a property of a judgment; if two judgments grasp one and the same proposition, one of them can be certain (in this subjective sense of the term) whereas the other one is not (WL III, 263 f.). As the two most important kinds of immediate judgments among the empirical ones Bolzano mentions judgments of the form “I — have — an appearance \(X\)” and “That (what I just now perceive of) — has — property \(b\)” (WL I, 181, WL III, 131, 139, 229). Judgments of these two kinds are called ‘(immediate) perceptual judgments’, whereas the term ‘empirical judgment’ is normally used only for mediated judgments containing a subjective intuition (WL III, 131 f.). The propositions “grasped” by these immediate perceptual judgments are empirical propositions whose subject ideas are intuitions that are usually expressed by means of the indexicals ‘I’ and ‘that’. Bolzano’s philosophy of science can thus be found to be empiricist, founded on a phenomenalist basis. With respect to all judgments \(m\) mediated by a set \(\mu\) of judgments, it is of high relevance whether the argument \(\langle \sigma , s\rangle\) corresponding to \(\langle \mu , m\rangle\) fulfills certain criteria. In the sections 3.8 and 3.9 we have already dealt with two logical relations which can obtain between the conclusion \(s\) and the set \(\sigma\) of premises of an argument \(\langle \sigma , s\rangle\) and which can easily be transferred to \(\langle \mu , m\rangle\): it is on the one hand the peculiar feature of \(s\) being a logical consequence of \(\sigma\), and on the other hand the peculiar feature of \(s\) having a certain degree of logical probability \(\gt \bfrac{1}{2}\) relative to \(\sigma\). With respect to empirical judgments, considerations of probability are in the foreground. Logical consequence “transfers” certainty, also in its subjective sense, from the premises to the conclusion of an inference. That is to say, if each member of a set \(\mu\) of judgments is certain for a person \(A\) (as is the case for each immediate judgment), and if a judgment \(m\) is mediated or caused by \(\mu\) insofar as it is inferred by \(A\) from \(\mu\) as a logical consequence of it, then \(m\) is also certain for \(A\) (WL III, 264 f.). In order for this to be the case, it is of course not enough for the argument \(\langle \sigma , s\rangle\) corresponding to \(\langle \mu , m\rangle\) to be logically correct, but it is required that \(A\) infers \(m\) from \(\mu\) in virtue (kraft) of the logical correctness of this argument. Error and uncertainty have two possible sources according to Bolzano: either the premises that one presupposes are uncertain (or even false), or one has used a mere probability inference (WL III, 265 f.), i.e., an inference whose conclusion asserts the truth of a proposition \(s\) itself instead of merely asserting the truth of the proposition [\(s\) is probable] (WL I, 182 ff., WL II, 510, WL III, 212 f.). Considerations of this kind amount to quite a refined epistemological system of subjective probability, in which Bolzano distinguishes degrees of credibility and of assurance by using his probability theory (WL III, 274–288). Unfortunately, these investigations are little known, since they are only developed in the third volume of his Theory of Science which receives far less attention than it deserves. a) Explication of the Entailment Relation: In addition to logical consequence and probability, there is a third category, however, that is brought into play by Bolzano within this context: it is the relation which obtains between a set \(\sigma\) of propositions and a proposition \(s\) iff \(\sigma\) is the “objective ground” of \(s\) or — in other words — iff \(s\) “follows objectively” from \(\sigma\); in today’s terminology we say instead that \(\sigma\) entails \(s\) or that \(s\) is entailed by \(\sigma\). This relation of entailment (Abfolge) is — to be clear — primarily not an epistemological relation but — like (logical) consequence and (logical) probability — a relation between a set of propositions and a single proposition (WL II, 339 ff., WL III, 495 f.). Bolzano’s favorite way of explaining this concept is by means of two inferences whose corresponding arguments are \(\langle \sigma_1, s_1\rangle\) and \(\langle \sigma_2, s_2\rangle\) such that the following holds: \(s_1\) describes the rising of a thermometer at a certain moment of time at a certain place, and \(s_2\) describes the rising of the temperature at the same place and time. \(\sigma_1\) contains the law that from the rising of temperature the extension of a liquid (in the thermometer) will follow, plus the required antecedent conditions, whereas \(\sigma_2\) contains the (statistically confirmed) proposition that, if a functioning thermometer at a certain time and place rises, then also the temperature there will rise, plus the corresponding antecedent conditions. (Sometimes Bolzano also uses an analogous example with atmospheric pressure and a barometer.) Let us assume that we have constructed the two arguments in such a way both that \(s_1\) is a logical consequence of \(\sigma_1\) and that \(s_2\) is a logical consequence of \(\sigma_2\). Nevertheless, Bolzano argues, there is an essential difference between the two examples insofar as \(\sigma_1\) is the \(_{}\)objective ground for \(s_1\), and \(s_1\) is therefore entailed by \(\sigma_1, _{}\)whereas this is not true for \(\langle \sigma_2, s_2\rangle\) (WL II, 192 f., 340, WL IV, 580 f., Bolzano 1975, 81 f.). b) Inferring in virtue of Entailment: In inferring \(s_1\) from \(\sigma_1\) we show why \(s_1\) is true, whereas in inferring \(s_2\) from \(\sigma_2\) we merely show that \(s_2\) is true, as it was already formulated by Aristotle (Analytica posteriora I, chap. 13) to whom Bolzano refers back in this context again and again (cf., e.g., WL II, 341, WL IV, 15, 262). Hereby, however, we quietly switch from inferences in themselves, represented by \(\langle \sigma_1, s_1\rangle\) and \(\langle \sigma_2, s_2\rangle\), to the corresponding mental processes of inferring, represented by \(\langle \mu_1, m_1\rangle\) and \(\langle \mu_2, m_2\rangle\), respectively, where the judgement \(m_1\) (grasping \(s_1)\) or \(m_2\) (grasping \(s_2)\), respectively, is inferred from the set of judgements \(\mu_1\) (whose members grasp the members of \(\sigma_1)\) or \(\mu_2\) (whose members grasp those of \(\sigma_2)\), respectively. Since in our example \(m_1\) as well as \(m_2\) is a true judgement or an act of knowledge (an Erkenntnis, as Bolzano calls it), \(\mu_1\) as well as \(\mu_2\) are reasons or grounds of knowledge (Erkenntnisgründe) for \(m_1\) or \(m_2\), respectively. Whereas \(\mu_2\) is a mere ground of knowledge (bloßer Erkenntnisgrund) for \(m_2\), however, \(\mu_1\) is an objective ground (objektiver Grund) for \(m_1\). Strictly speaking, however, \(\mu_1\) and \(\mu_2\) are not grounds at all, but rather causes of \(m_1\) and \(m_2\), respectively, as Bolzano specifies in WL III, 231 (see also WL II, 304, 340 f., 365, WL III, 267). Bolzano calls the inference \(\langle \mu_1, m_1\rangle\) an objective proof (objektiver Beweis) or an objective justification (objektive Begründung), while he calls the inference \(\langle \mu_2, m_2\rangle\) a mere subjective proof (subjektiver Beweis) or a mere “certification” (bloße Gewißmachung) (RW I, 6 f., WL II, 341, WL IV, 261–263, Bolzano 1975, 83–85). Ideas quite similar to these can be found in discussions on the concept of scientific explanation within modern philosophy of science (cf., e.g., Wolfgang Stegmüller, Probleme und Resultate der Wissenschaftstheorie und Analytischen Philosophie, Vol. 1, Heidelberg-New York: Springer, 193, Adolf Grünbaum, Philosophical Problems of Space and Time, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 309 f., or M. Scriven “Explanation and Predication in Evolutionary Theory”, Science 130 (1959), 477–482, cf. 480). Although only objective proofs are strictly scientific proofs for Bolzano (RW I, 7, WL IV, 261–263), his definition of a scientific textbook does not require that its proofs must be strictly scientific (WL I, 4, WL IV, 10 f., 15, 32). The duty to present objective proofs can be recognized, however, according to Bolzano from his concept of a science (WL IV, 10; cf. also WL IV, 32–34). The argument \(\langle \sigma_2, s_2\rangle\), mentioned before, provides us with an instance of a proposition \(s\) being a logical consequence of a set \(\sigma\) of propositions without being entailed by \(\sigma\). Can a proposition \(s\) also conversely be entailed by \(\sigma\) without being a logical consequence of \(\sigma\)? Bolzano guesses that this is possible but he is not definite about it (WL III, 346–348). The two relations are clearly distinct from one another anyway, since the entailment relation is — unlike the relation of logical consequence — asymmetrical and irreflexive. c) Entailment in various Areas of Knowledge: Whenever Bolzano touches on the topic of entailment, he introduces it by examples such as those mentioned above, viz. \(\langle \sigma_1, s_1\rangle\). In these examples, what is described by \(\sigma_1\) is the cause of the phenomenon described by \(s_1\). The entailment relation is not restricted, however, to these cases where it mirrors causality of our real world on the level of propositions in World 3; for Bolzano there are also obvious examples of the entailment relation in mathematics (e.g., RW I, 160 f., WL II, 191 f., 350, 361, 368, WL IV, 34, 262 f., 448, Bolzano 1841, 106 f., Bolzano 1842, 433, Bolzano 1975, 82), ethics (e.g., WL II, 339, 348, 359, 361), metaphysics (e.g., WL II 354, WL IV, 33) and theology (e.g., RW I, 6 f., 13, WL II, 354, 361, 368). Although the majority of examples Bolzano gives for the entailment relation in WL are taken from natural sciences, he himself worked for much of his life, with great originality and success, inspired by the search for strict entailment proofs of major results in mathematics. d) Entailment and Proof Theory: The idea of using the concept of entailment and of developing it further emerged for Bolzano originally, in fact, in connection with his mathematical studies. He criticised in his first publication (Bolzano 1804) some classical proofs for the theory of triangles and parallels for using inappropriate concepts such as motion and the plane. With hindsight we could say he thought such proofs could not express the entailment relations needed to give the objective grounds for the propositions to be proved and that they are therefore not — as they sould be — objective justifications but merely subjective proofs or certifications. The motivation of searching for such objective proofs in many areas of mathematics led to many original and fruitful concepts not appreciated, or re-discovered, until many decades later. No wonder then that Bolzano developed special rules for the relation of entailment in cases where it obtains between (sets of) conceptual propositions (Begriffssätze) as in mathematics and metaphysics: if a proposition \(s\) is a member of the set \(\sigma\) which is the objective ground of a conceptual proposition \(s', s\) must not contain more conceptual parts than \(s'\) (WL II, 384); when Bolzano says “not more”, however, he means rather “no other simple concepts than those contained also in \(s\)”. The relation of entailment between (sets of) conceptual truths has the characteristic feature that, according to it, from the smallest number of premisses the largest number of conclusions will follow none of which has simple components which are not also contained in its premisses (WL II, 386). Ideas such as these sound akin to Gerhard Gentzen’s characterization of normal proofs: “They do not make a detour. They do not introduce concepts which are not contained in its final result and must therefore be used necessarily in order to get it” (Gerhard Gentzen, “Untersuchungen über das logische Schliessen”, Mathematische Zeitschrift 39, 1934/35: 176–200, 405–431, see p.177). It has been pointed out, therefore, by several commentators, that there are interesting parallels between Bolzano’s semantic notion of entailment and Gentzen’s syntactic concept of “normal proofs” (cf. Buhl 1958, 85 f., Berg 1962, 151–164, and, more recently, Rumberg 2012), and that Bolzano in a certain sense anticipated Gentzen’s Hauptsatz (Berg 1987, 41). (In Schröter 1955, 60–61, 85–86, and Schröter 1958, 32–34, Gentzen’s consequence relation is compared with Bolzano’s relation of Ableitbarkeit, but, unfortunately, Bolzano’s relation of entailment (Abfolge) is not taken into consideration in this context by Schröter.) In spite of a certain lack of clarity in Bolzano’s explication, it is obvious that his concept of entailment is of great relevance not only for the philosophy of the empirical sciences but also with respect to proof theory. It is hard, however, to see how to reconcile the characteristic features of the entailment relation in its application to causality (in the empirical sciences) with those in its application to proof theory. e) Entailment and Grounding: Also the recent philosophical “movement” on grounding has an obvious affinity to Bolzano’s theory of entailment, as witnessed by numerous publications such as Schnieder & Correia 2012, Rumberg 2012, or Roski 2017.
