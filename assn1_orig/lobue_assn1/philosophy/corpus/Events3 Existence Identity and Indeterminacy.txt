 As mentioned in the Introduction, one finds a prima facie commitment to events in various aspects of human perception, action, language, and thought. The main line of argument offered to back up this commitment, however, comes from considerations of logical form. Not only does ordinary talk involve explicit reference to and quantification over events, as when one says that John’s walk was pleasant or that two explosions were heard last night. Ordinary talk also seems to involve several ways of adverting to events implicitly. Adverbial modification is a standard example (Reichenbach 1947). We say that Brutus stabbed Caesar with a knife. If this statement is taken to assert that a certain three-place relation obtains among Brutus, Caesar, and a knife, then it is hard to explain why the statement entails that Brutus stabbed Caesar (a statement that involves a different, two-place relation) (Kenny 1963). By contrast, if we take our statement to assert that a certain event occurred (namely, a stabbing of Caesar by Brutus) and that it had a certain property (namely, of being done with a knife), then the entailment is straightforward (Davidson 1967a).  These reasons do not constitute a proof that there are such entities as events. But they are telling insofar as one is interested in an account of how it is that certain statements mean what they mean, where the meaning of a statement is at least in part determined by its logical relations to other statements. For another example, it has been argued that singular causal statements cannot be analyzed in terms of a causal connective (essentially for reasons having to do with the above-mentioned slingshot argument) but rather require that causation be treated as a binary relation holding between individual events (Davidson 1967b). A third example involves the semantics of perceptual reports with naked infinitive complements, as in ‘John saw Mary cry’, which is analyzed as ‘John saw an event which was a crying by Mary’ (Higginbotham 1983; Vlach 1983; Gisborne 2010). Still a fourth example involves the logical form of statements with plural subjects, such as ‘John and Mary lifted the piano (together)’, which is analyzed as reporting, not the exploits of a “plural object”, but rather an event involving more than one agent (Higginbotham & Schein 1986; Schein 1993; Lasersohn 1995; Landman 1996, 2000). Many more such arguments have been offered, also by authors working within different programs in linguistics (Parsons 1990; Peterson 1997; Rothstein 1998; Link 1998; Higginbotham et al. 2000; Tenny & Pustejovsky 2000; Pietroski 2005; van Lambalgen & Hamm 2005; Robering 2014). On the other hand, some philosophers have been dissatisfied with this sort of “existential proof” and have argued instead that all talk that seems to involve explicit or implicit reference to or quantification over events can be paraphrased so as to avoid the commitment. For example, it has been argued that a term such as ‘John’s walk’ goes proxy for the corresponding statement ‘John walked’ (Geach 1965), so to say that John’s walk was pleasant is just to say that John walked pleasantly. Similar paraphrases have been offered to deal with the case of explicit quantifier-phrases such as ‘two explosions’ as well as with the implicit event quantification that lies behind adverb-dropping inferences (Clark 1970; Fulton 1979), singular causal statements (Horgan 1978, 1982; Wilson 1985, Needham 1988, 1994, Mellor 1991, 1995), and so on. On the face of it, it appears that questions of logical form leave the existential issue undecided, at least insofar as an event-committing analysis automatically turns into an eliminativist paraphrase when read in the opposite direction (and vice versa). Another issue that appears to be undecided concerns so-called identity criteria for events, which has been the focus of an intense debate (Bradie 1983; Pfeifer 1989; Mackie 1997).  Is John’s walk the same event as his pleasant walk? Was Brutus’s stabbing of Caesar the same event as his killing of Caesar? Was it the same as the violent assassination of Caesar? Some philosophers take these to be metaphysical questions—questions whose answers call for adequate identity criteria, which must be provided before we are allowed to take our event talk seriously. In this sense, different conceptions of events tend to suggest different answers, and widely varying ones. At one extreme we find the radical “unifiers”, who take events to be as coarse-grained as ordinary objects (Quine 1985; Lemmon 1967); at the other the radical “multipliers”, who take events to be as fine-grained as facts (Kim 1966; Goldman 1971); and in between several moderate variants (Davidson 1969; Davis 1970; Thalberg 1971; Thomson 1971; Brand 1977; Cleland 1991; Engel 1994; Jones 2013). Other philosophers, however, regard questions of identity to be first and foremost semantic questions—questions about the way we talk and about what we say. No metaphysical theory, it is said, can settle the semantics of ordinary event talk, hence there is no way of determining the truth or falsity of an event identity statement exclusively on the basis of one’s metaphysical views. Which events a statement speaks of depends heavily (more heavily than with ordinary material objects) on local context and unprincipled intuitions (Bennett 1988). If so, then the whole identity issue is undecidable, since one is demanding metaphysical answers to questions that are in large part semantical.
