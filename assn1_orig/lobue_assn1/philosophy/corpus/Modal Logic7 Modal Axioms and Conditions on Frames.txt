 One might assume from this discussion that \(\bK\) is the correct logic when \(\Box\) is read ‘it will always be the case that’. However, there are reasons for thinking that \(\bK\) is too weak. One obvious logical feature of the relation \(R\) (earlier than) is transitivity. If \(wRv (w\) is earlier than \(v)\) and \(vRu (v\) is earlier than \(u)\), then it follows that \(wRu (w\) is earlier than \(u)\). So let us define a new kind of validity that corresponds to this condition on \(R\). Let a 4-model be any model whose frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\) is such that \(R\) is a transitive relation on \(W\). Then an argument is 4-valid iff any 4-model whose valuation assigns \(T\) to the premises at a world also assigns \(T\) to the conclusion at the same world. We use ‘4’ to describe such a transitive model because the logic which is adequate (both sound and complete) for 4-validity is \(\mathbf{K4}\), the logic which results from adding the axiom (4): \(\Box A\rightarrow \Box \Box A\) to \(\bK\). Transitivity is not the only property which we might want to require of the frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\) if \(R\) is to be read ‘earlier than’ and \(W\) is a set of moments. One condition (which is only mildly controversial) is that there is no last moment of time, i.e. that for every world \(w\) there is some world \(v\) such that \(wRv\). This condition on frames is called seriality. Seriality corresponds to the axiom \((D): \Box A\rightarrow \Diamond A\), in the same way that transitivity corresponds to (4). A \(\mathbf{D}\)-model is a \(\bK\)-model with a serial frame. From the concept of a \(\mathbf{D}\)-model the corresponding notion of \(\mathbf{D}\)-validity can be defined just as we did in the case of 4-validity. As you probably guessed, the system that is adequate with respect to \(\mathbf{D}\)-validity is \(\mathbf{KD}\), or \(\bK\) plus \((D)\). Not only that, but the system \(\mathbf{KD4}\) (that is \(\bK\) plus (4) and \((D))\) is adequate with respect to \(\mathbf{D4}\)-validity, where a \(\mathbf{D4}\)-model is one where \(\langle W, R\rangle\) is both serial and transitive. Another property which we might want for the relation ‘earlier than’ is density, the condition which says that between any two times we can always find another. Density would be false if time were atomic, i.e. if there were intervals of time which could not be broken down into any smaller parts. Density corresponds to the axiom \((C4): \Box \Box A\rightarrow \Box A\), the converse of (4), so for example, the system \(\mathbf{KC4}\), which is \(\bK\) plus \((C4)\) is adequate with respect to models where the frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\) is dense, and \(\mathbf{KDC4}\), adequate with respect to models whose frames are serial and dense, and so on. Each of the modal logic axioms we have discussed corresponds to a condition on frames in the same way. The relationship between conditions on frames and corresponding axioms is one of the central topics in the study of modal logics. Once an interpretation of the intensional operator \(\Box\) has been decided on, the appropriate conditions on \(R\) can be determined to fix the corresponding notion of validity. This, in turn, allows us to select the right set of axioms for that logic. For example, consider a deontic logic, where \(\Box\) is read ‘it is obligatory that’. Here the truth of \(\Box A\) does not demand the truth of \(A\) in every possible world, but only in a subset of those worlds where people do what they ought. So we will want to introduce a relation \(R\) for this kind of logic as well, and use the truth clause \((K)\) to evaluate \(\Box A\) at a world. However, in this case, \(R\) is not earlier than. Instead \(wRw'\) holds just in case world \(w'\) is a morally acceptable variant of \(w\), i.e. a world that our actions can bring about which satisfies what is morally correct, or right, or just. Under such a reading, it should be clear that the relevant frames should obey seriality, the condition that requires that each possible world have a morally acceptable variant. The analysis of the properties desired for \(R\) makes it clear that a basic deontic logic can be formulated by adding the axiom \((D)\) and to \(\bK\). Even in modal logic, one may wish to restrict the range of possible worlds which are relevant in determining whether \(\Box A\) is true at a given world. For example, I might say that it is necessary for me to pay my bills, even though I know full well that there is a possible world where I fail to pay them. In ordinary speech, the claim that \(A\) is necessary does not require the truth of \(A\) in all possible worlds, but rather only in a certain class of worlds which I have in mind (for example, worlds where I avoid penalties for failure to pay). In order to provide a generic treatment of necessity, we must say that \(\Box A\) is true in \(w\) iff \(A\) is true in all worlds that are related to \(w\) in the right way. So for an operator \(\Box\) interpreted as necessity, we introduce a corresponding relation \(R\) on the set of possible worlds \(W\), traditionally called the accessibility relation. The accessibility relation \(R\) holds between worlds \(w\) and \(w'\) iff \(w'\) is possible given the facts of \(w\). Under this reading for \(R\), it should be clear that frames for modal logic should be reflexive. It follows that modal logics should be founded on \(M\), the system that results from adding \((M)\) to \(\bK\). Depending on exactly how the accessibility relation is understood, symmetry and transitivity may also be desired. A list of some of the more commonly discussed conditions on frames and their corresponding axioms along with a map showing the relationship between the various modal logics can be found in the next section.
