 The full axiom of choice can be stated as follows: If \(A,B\) are inhabited sets, and \(S\) a subset of \(A \times B\) such that then there exists a choice function \(f : A \rightarrow B\) such that Now, if this is to hold under a constructive interpretation, then for a given \(x \in A\), the value \(f(x)\) of the choice function will depend not only on \(x\) but also on the data proving that \(x\) belongs to \(A.\) In general, we cannot expect to produce a choice function of this sort. However, the BHK interpretation of the hypotheses in the axiom is that there is an algorithm  \(\mathcal{A}\)  which, applied to any given \(x \in A\), produces an element \(y \in B\) such that \((x,y) \in S\). If \(A\) is a completely presented set, one for which no work beyond the construction of each element in the set is required to prove that the element does indeed belong to \(A\), then we might reasonably expect the algorithm  \(\mathcal{A}\) to be a choice function. In  Martin-Löf’s type theory, every set is completely  presented and, in keeping with the BHK interpretation, the axiom  of choice is derivable. On the other hand, in Bishop-style mathematics, completely presented–––or, in his terminology, basic–––sets are rare, one example being \(\bN\); so we might expect that the axiom of choice would not be derivable. In fact, as was shown by Diaconescu [1975] and Goodman & Myhill [1978], and prefigured by Bishop himself in Problem 2 on page 58 of Bishop 1967, the axiom of choice implies the law of excluded middle. Clearly, the Diaconescu-Goodman-Myhill theorem applies only under the assumption that not every set is completely presented. Constructive mathematicians not working in ML typically reject the full axiom of choice but embrace the axiom of countable choice, in which the domain of choice is \(\bN\), and dependent choice. But some prefer to work without even countable choice, on the grounds that to speak of an infinity of choices without giving a rule presents a difficulty that is just as great whether or not the infinity is denumerable. Interestingly, Lebesgue made precisely this point in a letter to Borel (see Moore [2013], page 316): The effect of abandoning even countable choice is the exclusion of many theorems that, as they stand, are proved using sequential, choice-based arguments. But those who advocate avoiding choice would argue that avoiding choice forces you to formulate things better. A particular case of interest is the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra: every complex polynomial has at least one root in the complex plane. Richman [2000] has shown that without countable choice, although we can construct only isolated (possibly multiple) roots, we can construct arbitrarily close approximations to the multiset of roots. Such an approach focusses on finding an approximate linear factorization of the polynomial, rather than on finding separate approximations to each of its roots. For further analysis of the axiom of choice in set theory and type theory see Martin-Löf [2006], and the SEP entries on   category theory, type theory, and  intuitionistic type theory.
