 We have seen the analogy between the operation A \(\rightarrow\) A \(\rightarrow\) o on types and the powerset operation on sets. In set theory, the powerset operation can be iterated transfinitely along the cumulative hierarchy. It is then natural to look for analogous transfinite versions of type theory. One such extension of Church’s simple type theory is obtained by adding universes (Martin-Löf 1970). Adding a universe is a reflection process: we add a type \(U\) whose objects are the types considered so far. For Church’s simple type theory we will have and, furthermore, \(A\) is a type if \(A:U\). We can then consider types such as and functions such as The function id takes as argument a “small” type \(A:U\) and an element \(x\) of type \(A\), and outputs an element of type \(A\). More generally if \(T(A)\) is a type under the assumption \(A:U\), one can form the dependent type That \(M\) is of this type means that \(M A:T(A)\) whenever \(A:U\). We get in this way extensions of type theory whose strength is similar to the one of Zermelo’s set theory (Miquel 2001). More powerful form of universes are considered in (Palmgren 1998). Miquel (2003) presents a version of type theory of strength equivalent to the one of Zermelo-Fraenkel. One very strong form of universe is obtained by adding the axiom \(U:U\). This was suggested by P. Martin-Löf in 1970. J.Y. Girard showed that the resulting type theory is inconsistent as a logical system (Girard 1972). Though it seems at first that one could directly reproduce Russell’s paradox using a set of all sets, such a direct paradox is actually not possible due to the difference between sets and types. Indeed the derivation of a contradiction in such a system is subtle and has been rather indirect (though, as noticed in Miquel 2001, it can now be reduced to Russell’s paradox by representing sets as pointed graphs). J.Y. Girard first obtained his paradox for a weaker system. This paradox was refined later (Coquand 1994 and Hurkens 1995). (The notion of pure type system, introduced in Barendregt 1992, is convenient for getting a sharp formulation of these paradoxes.) Instead of the axiom \(U:U\) one assumes only if \(T(A) : U [A:U]\). Notice the circularity, indeed of the same kind as the one that is rejected by the ramified hierarchy: we define an element of type \(U\) by quantifying over all elements of \(U\). For instance the type will be the type of the polymorphic identity function. Despite this circularity, J.Y. Girard was able to show normalisation for type systems with this form of polymorphism. However, the extension of Church’s simple type theory with polymorphism is inconsistent as a logical system, i.e. all propositions (terms of type o) are provable. J.Y. Girard’s motivation for considering a type system with polymorphism was to extend Gödel’s Dialectica (Gödel 1958) interpretation to second-order arithmetic. He proved normalisation using the reducibility method, that had been introduced by Tait (1967) while analysing Gödel 1958. It is quite remarkable that the circularity inherent in impredicativity does not result in non-normalisable terms. (Girard’s argument was then used to show that cut-elimination terminates in Takeuti’s sequent calculus presented above.) A similar system was introduced independently by J. Reynolds (1974) while analysing the notion of polymorphism in computer science. Martin-Löf’s introduction of a type of all types comes from the identification of the concept of propositions and types, suggested by the work of Curry and Howard. It is worth recalling here his three motivating points: Given (1) and (2) we should have a type of propositions (as in simple type theory), and given (3) this should also be the type of all types. Girard’s paradox shows that one cannot have (1),(2) and (3) simultaneously. Martin-Löf’s choice was to take away (2), restricting type theory to be predicative (and, indeed, the notion of universe appeared first in type theory as a predicative version of the type of all types). The alternative choice of taking away (3) is discussed in Coquand 1986.
