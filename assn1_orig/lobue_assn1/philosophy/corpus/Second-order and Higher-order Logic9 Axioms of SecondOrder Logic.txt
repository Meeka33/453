 Recall our convention: Whenever we use upper case Fraktur letters, such as \(\ma,\mb,\mm,\mn\) etc, to name a structure, we use the upper case Italic versions of those letters, such as \(A,B,M,N\) etc, to name the domain of the structure. The deductive system of second-order logic, presented first explicitly in Hilbert-Ackermann (Hilbert & Ackermann 1938), is based on the obvious extension of axioms and rules of first order logic together with the Comprehension Axiom Schema, defined as follows: Suppose \(\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) is a second-order formula with \(x_1,\ldots, x_n\) among its free individual variables and the second-order variable R is not free in \(\phi\). Then the following formula is an instance of the Comprehension Axiom Schema: There is a similar schema for second-order formulas that define a function but we omit it here. An example of a very simple second-order inference in number theory would be A priori (\ref{CA}) might appear very strong as it stipulates the existence of a relation. However, such an R seems reasonable to accept because it is definable: Our Comprehension Axiom Schema is impredicative in the sense that the bound n-ary relation variables which may potentially occur in the formula \(\phi(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\) have R in their range. In this sense second-order logic is utterly impredicative. The Comprehension Axiom Schema has weaker forms that are less impredicative. In the Arithmetic Comprehension Schema we assume \(\phi(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\) is first order. In the \(\Pi^1_1\)-Comprehension Schema we assume \(\phi(a_1,\ldots, a_n)\) is \(\Pi^1_1\). In mathematical practice these two weaker principles usually suffice, see Simpson (1999 [2009]) and  §14. Hilbert-Ackermann (1938) added to the proof system of second-order logic also two different schemas that they call Axioms of Choice. We are used to thinking of the Axiom of Choice as a set-theoretical principle. But second-order logic has the same situation with choice principles as set theory. It makes perfect sense in second-order logic to ask whether there is a well-order of the domain. The existence of such a well-order does in general not follow from the Comprehension Schema because the well-order may be---and is likely to be---undefinable. So the only way to get a well-order of, say, the real numbers, in second-order logic is to assume some form of second-order Axiom of Choice. The first choice principle is and the second is where the formula \(\varphi'\) is obtained from the formula \(\varphi\) by replacing everywhere \(F(t_1,\ldots, t_k)\) by \(F'(t_1\ldots t_k,x_1,\ldots, x_m)\). The first Axiom of Choice (AC) says intuitively that if a set is non-empty, then there is a function which picks an element \(a_{n+1}\) from the set, using the parameters \(a_1,\ldots,a_{n}\) as arguments. The second Axiom of Choice (AC′) is a kind of second-order choice: We have for all \(a_1,\ldots,a_n\) a function F with the property \(\phi\), so in fact F depends on \(a_1,\ldots, a_n\) and should be denoted \(F_{a_1\ldots a_n}\). What (AC′) says now is that we can collect the functions \(F_{a_1\ldots a_n}\) together to form just one function \(F'\) of higher arity such that Although \(F'\) appears to be definable, this is not the case, as the mapping may be highly undefinable. Naturally, we may also want to assume the Well-ordering Principle which states that there is a binary relation which is a total order on the individuals and satisfies the condition that every non-empty set of individuals has a least element in the order. It is easy to see that this principle implies (AC′). In ZFC there are hundreds of equivalent formulations of the Axiom of Choice or weaker versions of it. Most of the formulations that are equivalent in ZFC are non-equivalent in second-order logic. This is because set theory allows free movement between sets and their power sets, but second-order logic does  not[11].  To obtain similar equivalence proofs as in set theory, one would have to move between second-order logic and third order logic, see Gaßner (1994). The concept of “general model” was introduced by Henkin (1950) in order to obtain a Completeness Theorem for second-order logic. General models are not the intended models of the axioms in the sense that bound relation and function variables do not range in these models over all relations and functions, only over a collection of them. The generally accepted attitude towards them is that they are not what one wants but they are necessary for obtaining a smooth theory. They are like irrational numbers in calculus: it would be ideal if all lengths that we encounter in calculus (or geometry) were commensurable, but that is not how things turned out. Some lengths are incommensurable, and we end up accepting irrational numbers in order to have a smooth general theory of lengths and their proportions. General models can be also compared to transitive models of set theory. One transitive model may say one thing is true, another says just the opposite is true. But together the transitive models help us understand the axioms of set theory. The current methods in the metamathematical investigation of the axioms of set theory, namely inner models and forcing extensions, all use transitive models of set theory in an essential way. Similarly general models of second-order logic help us investigate metamathematical properties of second-order logic and its axioms. Definition 12 A general model is a pair \((\mm,\G)\), where \(\mm\) is a usual L-structure and \(\G\) is a set of subsets, relations (of any arity) and functions (of any arity) on M. In monadic second-order logic \(\G\) is assumed to contain unary predicates only. We can define the concept for second-order \(\phi\) by induction on \(\phi\) by stipulating The difference to the original truth definition of second-order logic is thus that the interpretations of the second-order variables cannot be quite arbitrary, they have to be found in \(\G\). The smaller the \(\G\) is, the weaker the logic. On the other hand, if \(\G^\star\) is the set of all relations and functions on M, then the truth definition for the general model \((\mm,\G^\star)\) is the same as the original truth definition. We call such general models full and indeed identify \((\mm,\G^\star)\) with \(\mm\). The other extreme is that \(\G=\emptyset\). Then we are back in first order logic. To distinguish second-order logic with general models from the original second-order logic, we call the latter full. Definition 13 A general model which satisfies all the axioms of second-order logic, including the Comprehension Axiom Schema and the Axioms of Choice, is called a Henkin model. Note that there is no sentence of second-order logic which says that the model is full. That is, there is no second-order \(\phi\) such that for all general models \((\mm,\G)\) it holds that If we attempt to use \(\forall X\,\exists Y\,\forall x(X(x)\leftrightarrow Y(x))\) as such a \(\phi\), we just obtain the result that \(\phi\) is always true and says that the general model \((\mm,\G)\) is “full” in its own sense of “full”, not in the sense of the metatheory. A natural attempt to get a Henkin model \((\mm,\G)\) would be to let \(\G\) consist of first order definable relations and functions on \(\mm\). However, in this way we get only Arithmetic Comprehension, not the full Comprehension Axiom. An easy way to obtain a Henkin model \((\mm,\G)\) is to take a transitive model N of ZFC such that \(\mm\in N\) and let \(\G\) consist of all relations and functions on M that are elements of N. It follows from \(N\models ZFC\) that \((\mm,\G)\) is a Henkin model. Truth in a general model, namely the proposition “\((\mm,\G)\models_s\phi\)” is absolute relative to ZFC, contrary to the truth definition of (full) second-order logic. In this respect second-order logic with general models resembles first order logic. As we will see, it resembles first order logic in many other respects, too. Second-order logic with general models can be thought of in terms of many sorted logic. Many sorted logic is first order logic with several different sorts of variables. Respectively, relations and functions may be between elements of different sorts. Here “sort” just means that variables of different “sorts” are kept apart by giving them different names. Otherwise the variables are just ordinary first order variables. Structures \(\mm\) of many-sorted logic have a separate domain \(M_s\) for each sort s. We may think of second-order logic as many sorted logic in which the individual variables are of a sort \(\si\), for each n the n-ary relation variables are of a sort \(\sr\), and the n-ary function variables of a sort \(s_n^{\rm fu}\). In addition there is an \(n+1\)-ary relation symbol \(\sA\) between n-tuples of individuals and n-ary relation variables indicating which n-tuples are in a relation and which are not. Finally there is an \(n+1\)-ary function symbol \(\sF\) between n-tuples of individual, individuals, and n-ary function variables indicating what value a function variable gives to each n-tuple. There are obvious first order axioms which guarantee that the many sorted logic just described faithfully mirrors second-order logic with general models.  [12] For more on the reduction of second-order logic to many-sorted logic, we refer to Manzano (1996). For example, the proof theory of second-order logic can be understood via the translation to many sorted logic. For more on the proof theory of second-order logic, see Buss (1998). There is a translation of many sorted logic further to single sorted first order logic due essentially to Herbrand (1930), see also Wang (1952) and Schmidt (1951). This can be used to obtain many of the basic properties of first order logic first for many sorted logic and then further for second-order logic with general models. The most important application of general models is the Completeness Theorem: Theorem 14 (Henkin 1950) A second-order sentence follows from the axioms if and only if it is true in all Henkin models.  [13] Respectively, we obtain the Compactness  Theorem[14]  as well as the downward and the upward versions of the Löwenheim-Skolem  Theorem.[15] One way to think about Henkin models is that they fill the gaps left by full models, just as irrational numbers fill the gaps left by rational numbers. They are needed in order to obtain a smooth theory of second-order logic. They manifest “paradoxical” phenomena that we do not see among full models. For example we obtain non-standard models of number theory, countable models of the axioms of real numbers, etc. The categorical sentences characterizing mathematical structures among full models now suddenly have also other “models”, namely Henkin models, and they come in all infinite cardinalities. If \(\phi\) is a second-order sentence we define Obviously, \(\Mod(\phi)\subseteq \textit{Mod}_H(\phi)\). If \(\phi\) characterizes \(\mm\) up to isomorphism, then \(\mm\in \Mod(\phi) \). In all non-trivial  cases[16]  \(\textit{Mod}_H(\phi)\ne \{\mm\}\). We can think of \(\textit{Mod}_H(\phi)\) as a class of “approximations” of \(\mm\). One of the approximations is the “real” \(\mm\) but by means of deductions in second-order logic we cannot tell which. Because of the inherent weakness of formal systems, going back to Skolem and Gödel, infinite structures are shrouded by Henkin models and cannot be gotten perfectly into focus by deductive means. The Fraenkel-Mostowski method is a construction of Henkin models which was first used in set theory to obtain models where Axiom of Choice fails, and later used in second-order logic to obtain similar models before the method of forcing emerged. The method goes as follows: Suppose \(\ma\) is a structure and H is a group of permutations on A. A subset B of \(A^n\) is called symmetric if there is a finite set \(E\subseteq A\), called a support of B, such that for all \(\pi\in H\) which fix E  pointwise[17], The respective condition for a function \(f:A^n\to A\) is Let \(\G\) be the set of symmetric relations and functions on A. The pair \((\ma,\G)\) is always a Henkin model. Among the early applications of the Fraenkel-Mostowski method were the result of Mostowski (1938) that one cannot prove from the Comprehension Axiom Schema alone the equivalence of two different definitions of finiteness and of Lindenbaum and Mostowski (1938) that Zermelo's axioms for set theory are not enough to prove the Axiom of Choice, or even just that every infinite set is the disjoint union of two infinite sets. The Fraenkel model arises if H is the group of all permutations of an infinite set A. In the Fraenkel model the set A is infinite but Dedekind-finite (i.e., A has no one-one function into a proper subset) and cannot be well-ordered, not even linearly ordered. Moreover, the set A is not the disjoint union of two infinite sets. There is no choice function for two element subsets of A. The Mostowski model arises if \(A=\oQ\) and H is the group of automorphisms of \((\oQ,<)\). In the Mostowski model the set A can be linearly ordered but not well-ordered. The Axiom of Choice holds for (sets of) non-empty finite sets. For more on Fraenkel-Mostowski models as Henkin models for second-order logic, see Gaßner (1994). Recall our convention: Whenever we use upper case Fraktur letters, such as \(\ma,\mb,\mm,\mn\) etc, to name a structure, we use the upper case Italic versions of those letters, such as \(A,B,M,N\) etc, to name the domain of the structure. The axioms of second-order logic are trivially true in a (full) model with just one element. This raises the question how to guarantee that there are more than one element in the domain. Of course, we can add, for every n, an axiom which says that there are more than n elements. There are various ways to say in second-order logic with one axiom that there are infinitely many individuals. These are equivalent in full models but may be non-equivalent in Henkin models. Some are equivalent if the Axiom of Choice is assumed. Let us call a second-order sentence \(\phi\) of the empty vocabulary an Axiom of Infinity if An axiom of infinity can say in second-order logic that a proper subset of the domain has the same cardinality as the entire domain (i.e., that the domain is not Dedekind-finite), or that there is a partial order without a maximal element, or that there is a set with a unary function and a constant which constitute a structure isomorphic to \((\oN,s,0)\), or that the domain is the union of two disjoint sets which have the same cardinality as the domain, and so on. As is the case in set theory without the Axiom of Choice, the different formulations of infiniteness need not be equivalent. In second-order logic the situation is even more diffuse because of the variety of different formulations of the Axiom of Choice. We refer to Asser (1981) for a discussion of the different variants and to Hasenjaeger (1961) for a proof that the various non-equivalent forms of Axioms of Infinity form in a sense a dense set. For a survey of different concepts of finiteness, see de la Cruz (2002).
