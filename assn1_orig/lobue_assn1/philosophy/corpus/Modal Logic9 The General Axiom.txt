 The correspondence between axioms and conditions on frames may seem something of a mystery. A beautiful result of Lemmon and Scott (1977) goes a long way towards explaining those relationships. Their theorem concerned axioms which have the following form: We use the notation ‘\(\Diamond^n\)’ to represent \(n\) diamonds in a row, so, for example, ‘\(\Diamond^3\)’ abbreviates a string of three diamonds: ‘\(\Diamond \Diamond \Diamond\)’. Similarly ‘\(\Box^n\)’ represents a string of \(n\) boxes. When the values of \(h, i, j\), and \(k\) are all 1, we have axiom \((C)\): The axiom \((B)\) results from setting \(h\) and \(i\) to 0, and letting \(j\) and \(k\) be 1: To obtain (4), we may set \(h\) and \(k\) to 0, set \(i\) to 1 and \(j\) to 2: Many (but not all) axioms of modal logic can be obtained by setting the right values for the parameters in \((G)\) Our next task will be to give the condition on frames which corresponds to \((G)\) for a given selection of values for \(h, i, j\), and \(k\). In order to do so, we will need a definition. The composition of two relations \(R\) and \(R'\) is a new relation \(R \circ R'\) which is defined as follows: For example, if \(R\) is the relation of being a brother, and \(R'\) is the relation of being a parent then \(R \circ R'\) is the relation of being an uncle, (because \(w\) is the uncle of \(v\) iff for some person \(u\), both \(w\) is the brother of \(u\) and \(u\) is the parent of \(v)\). A relation may be composed with itself. For example, when \(R\) is the relation of being a parent, then \(R \circ R\) is the relation of being a grandparent, and \(R \circ R \circ R\) is the relation of being a great-grandparent. It will be useful to write ‘\(R^n\)’, for the result of composing \(R\) with itself \(n\) times. So \(R^2\) is \(R \circ R\), and \(R^4\) is \(R \circ R \circ R \circ R\). We will let \(R^1\) be \(R\), and \(R^0\) will be the identity relation, i.e. \(wR^0 v\) iff \(w=v\). We may now state the Scott-Lemmon result. It is that the condition on frames which corresponds exactly to any axiom of the shape \((G)\) is the following. It is interesting to see how the familiar conditions on \(R\) result from setting the values for \(h\), \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) according to the values in the corresponding axiom. For example, consider (5). In this case \(i=0\), and \(h=j=k=1\). So the corresponding condition is We have explained that \(R^0\) is the identity relation. So if \(vR^0 x\) then \(v=x\). But \(\exists x (v=x \amp uRx)\), is equivalent to \(uRv\), and so the Euclidean condition is obtained: In the case of axiom (4), \(h=0, i=1, j=2\) and \(k=0\). So the corresponding condition on frames is Resolving the identities this amounts to: By the definition of \(R^2, vR^2 u\) iff \(\exists x(vRx \amp xRu)\), so this comes to: which by predicate logic, is equivalent to transitivity. The reader may find it a pleasant exercise to see how the corresponding conditions fall out of hijk-Convergence when the values of the parameters \(h\), \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\) are set by other axioms. The Scott-Lemmon results provides a quick method for establishing results about the relationship between axioms and their corresponding frame conditions. Since they showed the adequacy of any logic that extends \(\bK\) with a selection of axioms of the form \((G)\) with respect to models that satisfy the corresponding set of frame conditions, they provided “wholesale” adequacy proofs for the majority of systems in the modal family. Sahlqvist (1975) has discovered important generalizations of the Scott-Lemmon result covering a much wider range of axiom types. The reader should be warned, however, that the neat correspondence between axioms and conditions on frames is atypical. There are condtions on frames that correspond to no axioms, and there are even conditions on frames for which no system is adequate. (For an example see Boolos, 1993, pp. 148ff.)
