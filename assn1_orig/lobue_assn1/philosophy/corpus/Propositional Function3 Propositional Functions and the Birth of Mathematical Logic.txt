 In the work of Giuseppe Peano (1858–1932), we find another important step towards the modern notion of a propositional function. Although his work is not as sophisticated as Frege's (see below), it is important because it is influential particularly on Bertrand Russell. In his ‘Principles of Arithmetic Presented by a New Method’ (1889), Peano introduces propositional connectives in the modern sense (an implication, negation, conjunction, disjunction, and a biconditional) and propositional constants (a verum and a falsum). More important for us is his treatment of quantification. Peano allows propositions to contain variables, that is to say, he utilizes open formulas. He does not give an interpretation of open formulas. He does not tell us what they represent. But they are used in his theory of quantification. Peano only has a universal quantifier. He does not define an existential quantifier in the ‘Principles’. The quantifier is always attached to a conditional or biconditional. Quantified propositions are always of the form A ⊃x,y,… B or A =x,y,… B Peano reads ‘A ⊃x,y,… B’ as saying ‘whatever x,y,…  may be, from the proposition A one deduces B’ and ‘=’ is Peano's biconditional, that he defines in the usual way from the conditional and conjunction. But he provides us with no more interpretation than that. He refers to variables as ‘indeterminate objects’, but does not discuss what this or what a proposition (or propositional function) that contains propositional objects might be.
