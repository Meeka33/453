 We now introduce a deductive system, \(D\), for our languages. As above, we define an argument to be a non-empty collection of sentences in the formal language, one of which is designated to be the conclusion. If there are any other sentences in the argument, they are its  premises.[1]  By convention, we use “\(\Gamma\)”, “\(\Gamma'\)”, “\(\Gamma_1\)”, etc, to range over sets of formulas, and we use the letters “\(\phi\)”, “\(\psi\)”, “\(\theta\)”, uppercase or lowercase, with or without subscripts, to range over single formulas. We write “\(\Gamma, \Gamma'\)” for the union of \(\Gamma\) and \(\Gamma'\), and “\(\Gamma, \phi\)” for the union of \(\Gamma\) with \(\{\phi\}\). We write an argument in the form \(\langle \Gamma, \phi \rangle\), where \(\Gamma\) is a set of sentences, the premises, and \(\phi\) is a single sentence, the conclusion. Remember that \(\Gamma\) may be empty. We write \(\Gamma \vdash \phi\) to indicate that \(\phi\) is deducible from \(\Gamma\), or, in other words, that the argument \(\langle \Gamma, \phi \rangle\) is deducible in \(D\). We may write \(\Gamma \vdash_D \phi\) to emphasize the deductive system \(D\). We write \(\vdash \phi\) or \(\vdash_D \phi\) to indicate that \(\phi\) can be deduced (in \(D)\) from the empty set of premises. The rules in \(D\) are chosen to match logical relations concerning the English analogues of the logical terminology in the language. Again, we define the deducibility relation by recursion. We start with a rule of assumptions: We thus have that \(\{\phi \}\vdash \phi\); each premise follows from itself. We next present two clauses for each connective and quantifier. The clauses indicate how to “introduce” and “eliminate” sentences in which each symbol is the main connective. First, recall that “\(\amp\)” is an analogue of the English connective “and”. Intuitively, one can deduce a sentence in the form \((\theta \amp \psi)\) if one has deduced \(\theta\) and one has deduced \(\psi\). Conversely, one can deduce \(\theta\) from \((\theta \amp \psi)\) and one can deduce \(\psi\) from \((\theta \amp \psi)\): The name “&I” stands for “&-introduction”; “&E” stands for “&-elimination”. Since, the symbol “\(\vee\)” corresponds to the English “or”, \((\theta \vee \psi)\) should be deducible from \(\theta\), and \((\theta \vee \psi)\) should also be deducible from \(\psi\): The elimination rule is a bit more complicated. Suppose that “\(\theta\) or \(\psi\)” is true. Suppose also that \(\phi\) follows from \(\theta\) and that \(\phi\) follows from \(\psi\). One can reason that if \(\theta\) is true, then \(\phi\) is true. If instead \(\psi\) is true, we still have that \(\phi\) is true.  So either way, \(\phi\) must be true. For the next clauses, recall that the symbol, “\(\rightarrow\)”, is  an analogue of the English “if … then … ”  construction. If one knows, or assumes \((\theta \rightarrow \psi)\) and  also knows, or assumes \(\theta\), then one can conclude  \(\psi\). Conversely, if one deduces \(\psi\) from an assumption \(\theta\),  then one can conclude that \((\theta \rightarrow \psi)\). This elimination rule is sometimes called “modus ponens”. In some logic texts, the introduction rule is proved as a “deduction theorem”. Our next clauses are for the negation sign, “\(\neg\)”. The underlying idea is that a sentence \(\psi\) is inconsistent with its negation \(\neg \psi\). They cannot both be true. We call a pair of sentences \(\psi, \neg \psi\) contradictory opposites. If one can deduce such a pair from an assumption \(\theta\), then one can conclude that \(\theta\) is false, or, in other words, one can conclude \(\neg \theta\). By (As), we have that \(\{A,\neg A\}\vdash A\) and \(\{\)A,\(\neg\)A\(\}\vdash \neg A\). So by \(\neg\)I we have that \(\{A\}\vdash \neg \neg A\). However, we do not have the converse yet. Intuitively, \(\neg \neg \theta\) corresponds to “it is not the case that it is not the case that” . One might think that this last is equivalent to \(\theta\), and we have a rule to that effect: The name DNE stands for “double-negation elimination”. There is some controversy over this inference. It is rejected by philosophers and mathematicians who do not hold that each meaningful sentence is either true or not true. Intuitionistic logic does not sanction the inference in question (see, for example Dummett [2000], or the entry on  intuitionistic logic, or  history of intuitionistic logic), but, again, classical logic does. To illustrate the parts of the deductive system \(D\) presented thus far, we show that \(\vdash(A \vee \neg A)\): The principle \((\theta \vee \neg \theta)\) is sometimes called the  law of excluded middle. It is not valid in intuitionistic logic. Let \(\theta, \neg \theta\) be a pair of contradictory opposites, and let \(\psi\) be any sentence at all. By (As) we have \(\{\theta, \neg \theta, \neg \psi \}\vdash \theta\) and \(\{\theta, \neg \theta, \neg \psi \}\vdash \neg \theta\). So by \((\neg\)I), \(\{\theta, \neg \theta \}\vdash \neg \neg \psi\). So, by (DNE) we have \(\{\theta , \neg \theta \}\vdash \psi\) . That is, anything at all follows from a pair of contradictory opposites. Some logicians introduce a rule to codify a similar inference: If \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \neg \theta\), then for any sentence \(\psi, \Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash \psi\) The inference is sometimes called ex falso quodlibet or, more colorfully, explosion. Some call it “\(\neg\)-elimination”, but perhaps this stretches the notion of “elimination” a bit. We do not officially include ex falso quodlibet as a separate rule in \(D\), but as will be shown below (Theorem 10), each instance of it is derivable in our system \(D\). Some logicians object to ex falso quodlibet, on the ground that the sentence \(\psi\) may be irrelevant to any of the premises in \(\Gamma\). Suppose, for example, that one starts with some premises \(\Gamma\) about human nature and facts about certain people, and then deduces both the sentence “Clinton had extra-marital sexual relations” and “Clinton did not have extra-marital sexual relations”. One can perhaps conclude that there is something wrong with the premises \(\Gamma\). But should we be allowed to then deduce anything at all from \(\Gamma\)? Should we be allowed to deduce “The economy is sound”? A small minority of logicians, called dialetheists, hold that some contradictions are actually true. For them, ex falso quodlibet is not truth-preserving. Deductive systems that demur from ex falso quodlibet are called paraconsistent. Most relevant logics are paraconsistent. See the entries on   relevance logic,   paraconsistent logic,  and  dialetheism.  Or see Anderson and Belnap [1975], Anderson, Belnap, and Dunn [1992], and Tennant [1997] for fuller overviews of relevant logic; and Priest [2006],[2006a] for dialetheism. Deep philosophical issues concerning the nature of   logical consequence  are involved. Far be it for an article in a philosophy encyclopedia to avoid philosophical issues, but space considerations preclude a fuller treatment of this issue here. Suffice it to note that the inference ex falso quodlibet is sanctioned in systems of classical logic, the subject of this article. It is essential to establishing the balance between the deductive system and the semantics (see §5 below). The next pieces of \(D\) are the clauses for the quantifiers. Let  \(\theta\) be a formula, \(v\) a variable, and \(t\) a term (i.e., a variable or a constant). Then define  \(\theta(v|t)\) to be the result of substituting \(t\) for each free occurrence of \(v\) in  \(\theta\). So, if  \(\theta\) is \((Qx \amp \exists\)xPxy), then  \(\theta(x|c)\) is \((Qc \amp \exists\)xPxy). The last occurrence of \(x\) is not free. A sentence in the form \(\forall v \theta\) is an analogue of the English “for every \(v, \theta\) holds”. So one should be able to infer \(\theta(v|t)\) from \(\forall v \theta\) for any closed term \(t\). Recall that the only closed terms in our system are constants. The idea here is that if \(\forall v \theta\) is true, then \(\theta\) should hold of \(t\), no matter what \(t\) is. The introduction clause for the universal quantifier is a bit more complicated. Suppose that a sentence \(\theta\) contains a closed term \(t\), and that \(\theta\) has been deduced from a set of premises \(\Gamma\). If the closed term \(t\) does not occur in any member of \(\Gamma\), then \(\theta\) will hold no matter which object \(t\) may denote. That is, \(\forall v \theta\) follows. This rule \((\forall \mathbf{I})\) corresponds to a common inference in mathematics. Suppose that a mathematician says “let \(n\) be a natural number” and goes on to show that \(n\) has a certain property \(P\), without assuming anything about \(n\) (except that it is a natural number). She then reminds the reader that \(n\) is “arbitrary”, and concludes that \(P\) holds for all natural numbers. The condition that the term \(t\) not occur in any premise is what guarantees that it is indeed “arbitrary”. It could be any object, and so anything we conclude about it holds for all objects. The existential quantifier is an analogue of the English expression “there exists”, or perhaps just “there is”. If we have established (or assumed) that a given object \(t\) has a given property, then it follows that there is something that has that property. The elimination rule for \(\exists\) is not quite as simple: This elimination rule also corresponds to a common inference. Suppose that a mathematician assumes or somehow concludes that there is a natural number with a given property \(P\). She then says “let \(n\) be such a natural number, so that \(Pn\)”, and goes on to establish a sentence \(\phi\), which does not mention the number \(n\). If the derivation of \(\phi\) does not invoke anything about \(n\) (other than the assumption that it has the given property \(P)\), then \(n\) could have been any number that has the property \(P\). That is, \(n\) is an arbitrary number with property \(P\) (this is where we invoke constants which “denote” arbitrary objects). It does not matter which number \(n\) is. Since \(\phi\) does not mention \(n\), it follows from the assertion that something has property \(P\). The provisions added to \((\exists\)E) are to guarantee that \(t\) is “arbitrary”. The final items are the rules for the identity sign “=”. The introduction rule is about a simple as can be: This “inference” corresponds to the truism that everything is identical to itself. The elimination rule corresponds to a principle that if \(a\) is identical to \(b\), then anything true of \(a\) is also true of \(b\). The rule \(({=}\mathrm{E})\) indicates a certain restriction in the expressive resources of our language. Suppose, for example, that Harry is identical to Donald (since his mischievous parents gave him two names). According to most people’s intuitions, it would not follow from this and “Dick knows that Harry is wicked” that “Dick knows that Donald is wicked”, for the reason that Dick might not know that Harry is identical to Donald. Contexts like this, in which identicals cannot safely be substituted for each other, are called “opaque”. We assume that our language \(\LKe\) has no opaque contexts. One final clause completes the description of the deductive system \(D\): Again, this clause allows proofs by induction on the rules used to establish an argument. If a property of arguments holds of all instances of (As) and \(({=}\mathrm{I})\), and if the other rules preserve the property, then every argument that is deducible in \(D\) enjoys the property in question. Before moving on to the model theory for \(\LKe\), we pause to note a few features of the deductive system. To illustrate the level of rigor, we begin with a lemma that if a sentence does not contain a particular closed term, we can make small changes to the set of sentences we prove it from without problems. We allow ourselves the liberty here of extending some previous notation: for any terms \(t\) and \(t'\), and any formula \(\theta\), we say that \(\theta(t|t')\) is the result of replacing all free occurrences of \(t\) in \(\theta\) with \(t'\). Lemma 7.  If \(\Gamma_1\) and \(\Gamma_2\) differ only in that wherever \(\Gamma_1\) contains \(\theta\), \(\Gamma_2\) contains \(\theta(t|t')\), then for any sentence \(\phi\) not containing \(t\) or \(t'\), if \(\Gamma_1\vdash\phi\) then \(\Gamma_2\vdash\phi\). Proof: The proof proceeds by induction on the number of steps in the proof of \(\phi\). Crucial to this proof is the fact that \(\theta=\theta(t|t')\) whenever \(\theta\) does not contain \(t\) or \(t'\). When the number of steps in the proof of \(\phi\) is one, this means that the last (and only) rule applied is (As) or (=I). Then, since \(\phi\) does not contain \(t\) or \(t'\), if \(\Gamma_1\vdash\phi\) we simply apply the same rule ((As) or (=I)) to \(\Gamma_2\) to get \(\Gamma_2\vdash\phi\). Assume that there are \(n>1\) steps in the proof of \(\phi\), and that Lemma 7 holds for any proof with less than \(n\) steps. Suppose that the \(n^{th}\) rule applied to \(\Gamma_1\) was (\(\amp I\)). Then \(\phi\) is \(\psi\amp\chi\), and \(\Gamma_1\vdash\phi\amp\chi\). But then we know that previous steps in the proof include \(\Gamma_1\vdash\psi\) and \(\Gamma_1\vdash\chi\), and by induction, we have \(\Gamma_2\vdash\psi\) and \(\Gamma_2\vdash\chi\), since neither \(\psi\) nor \(\chi\) contain \(t\) or \(t'\). So, we simply apply (\(\amp I\)) to \(\Gamma_2\) to get \(\Gamma_2\vdash\psi\amp\chi\) as required. Suppose now that the last step applied in the proof of \(\Gamma_1\vdash\phi\) was (\(\amp E\)). Then, at a previous step in the proof of \(\phi\), we know \(\Gamma_1\vdash\phi\amp\psi\) for some sentence \(\psi\). If \(\psi\) does not contain \(t\), then we simply apply (\(\amp E\)) to \(\Gamma_2\) to obtain the desired result. The only complication is if \(\psi\) contains \(t\). Then we would have that \(\Gamma_2\vdash (\phi\amp\psi)(t|t')\). But, since \((\phi\amp\psi)(t|t')\) is \(\phi(t|t')\amp\psi(t|t')\), and \(\phi(t|t')\) is just \(\phi\), we can just apply (\(\amp E\)) to get \(\Gamma_2\vdash\phi\) as required. The cases for the other rules are similar. Theorem 8. The rule of Weakening. If \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \phi\) and \(\Gamma_1 \subseteq \Gamma_2\), then \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \phi\). Proof: Again, we proceed by induction on the number of rules that were used to arrive at \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \phi\). Suppose that \(n\gt 0\) is a natural number, and that the theorem holds for any argument that was derived using fewer than \(n\) rules. Suppose that \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \phi\) using exactly \(n\) rules. If \(n=1\), then the rule is either (As) or \((=\)I). In these cases, \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \phi\) by the same rule. If the last rule applied was (&I), then \(\phi\) has the form \((\theta \amp \psi)\), and we have \(\Gamma_3 \vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma_4 \vdash \psi\), with \(\Gamma_1 = \Gamma_3, \Gamma_4\).  We apply the induction hypothesis to the deductions of \(\theta\) and \(\psi\), to get \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \psi\).  and then apply (&I) to the result to get \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \phi\).  Most of the other cases are exactly like this. Slight complications arise only in the rules \((\forall\)I) and \((\exists\)E), because there we have to pay attention to the conditions for the rules. Suppose that the last rule applied to get \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \phi\) is \((\forall\)I). So \(\phi\) is a sentence of the form \(\forall v\theta\), and we have \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \theta (v|t)\) and \(t\) does occur in any member of \(\Gamma_1\) or in \(\theta\).  The problem is that \(t\) may occur in a member of \(\Gamma_2\), and so we cannot just invoke the induction hypothesis and apply \((\forall\)I) to the result. So, let \(t'\) be a term not occurring in any sentence in \(\Gamma_2\). Let \(\Gamma'\) be the result of substituting \(t'\) for all \(t\) in \(\Gamma_2\). Then, since \(t\) does not occur in \(\Gamma_1\), \(\Gamma_1\subseteq\Gamma'\). So, the induction hypothesis gives us \(\Gamma'\vdash\theta (v|t)\), and we know that \(\Gamma'\) does not contain \(t\), so we can apply (\(\forall I\)) to get \(\Gamma'\vdash\forall v\theta\). But \(\forall v\theta\) does not contain \(t\) or \(t'\), so \(\Gamma_2\vdash\forall v\theta\) by Lemma 7. Suppose that the last rule applied was \((\exists\)E), we have \(\Gamma_3 \vdash \exists v\theta\) and \(\Gamma_4, \theta (v|t) \vdash \phi\), with \(\Gamma_1\) being \(\Gamma_3, \Gamma_4\), and \(t\) not in \(\phi\), \(\Gamma_4\) or \(\theta\).  If \(t\) does not occur free in \(\Gamma_2\), we apply the induction hypothesis to get \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \exists v\theta\), and then \((\exists\)E) to end up with \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \phi\). If \(t\) does occur free in \(\Gamma_2\), then we follow a similar proceedure to \(\forall I\), using Lemma 7. Theorem 8 allows us to add on premises at will. It follows that  \(\Gamma \vdash \phi\) if and only if there is a subset  \(\Gamma'\subseteq \Gamma\) such that  \(\Gamma'\vdash \phi\). Some systems of relevant  logic do not have weakening, nor does substructural logic (See the  entries on  relevance logic,  substructural logics, and  linear logic). By clause (*), all derivations are established in a finite number of steps.  So we have Theorem 9.  \(\Gamma \vdash \phi\) if and only if there is a finite \(\Gamma'\subseteq \Gamma\) such that \(\Gamma'\vdash \phi\). Theorem 10. The rule of ex falso quodlibet is a “derived rule” of \(D\): if \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \neg \theta\), then \(\Gamma_1,\Gamma_2 \vdash \psi\), for any sentence \(\psi\). Proof: Suppose that \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma_2 \vdash \neg \theta\). Then by Theorem \(8, \Gamma_1,\neg \psi \vdash \theta\), and \(\Gamma_2,\neg \psi \vdash \neg \theta\). So by \((\neg\)I), \(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash \neg \neg \psi\). By (DNE), \(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash \psi\). Theorem 11. The rule of Cut.  If \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \psi\) and \(\Gamma_2, \psi \vdash \theta\), then \(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash \theta\). Proof: Suppose \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \psi\) and \(\Gamma_2, \psi \vdash \theta\).  We proceed by induction on the number of rules used to establish \(\Gamma_2, \psi \vdash \theta\). Suppose that \(n\) is a natural number, and that the theorem holds for any argument that was derived using fewer than \(n\) rules. Suppose that \(\Gamma_2, \psi \vdash \theta\) was derived using exactly \(n\) rules. If the last rule used was \((=\)I), then \(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash \theta\) is also an instance of \((=\)I). If \(\Gamma_2, \psi \vdash \theta\) is an instance of (As), then either \(\theta\) is \(\psi\), or \(\theta\) is a member of \(\Gamma_2\). In the former case, we have \(\Gamma_1 \vdash \theta\) by supposition, and get \(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash \theta\) by Weakening (Theorem 8).  In the latter case, \(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash \theta\) is itself an instance of (As). Suppose that \(\Gamma_2, \psi \vdash \theta\) was obtained using (&E). Then we have \(\Gamma_2, \psi \vdash(\theta \amp \phi)\).  The induction hypothesis gives us \(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash(\theta \amp \phi)\), and (&E) produces \(\Gamma_1, \Gamma_2 \vdash \theta\).  The remaining cases are similar. Theorem 11 allows us to chain together inferences. This fits the practice of establishing theorems and lemmas and then using those theorems and lemmas later, at will. The cut principle is, some think, essential to reasoning. In some logical systems, the cut principle is a deep theorem; in others it is invalid. The system here was designed, in part, to make the proof of Theorem 11 straightforward. If \(\Gamma \vdash_D \theta\), then  we say that the sentence \(\theta\) is a deductive consequence  of the set of sentences \(\Gamma\), and that the argument  \(\langle \Gamma,\theta \rangle\) is deductively valid. A sentence  \(\theta\) is a logical theorem, or a deductive logical  truth,  if \(\vdash_D \theta\). That is,  \(\theta\) is a logical theorem if it is a deductive consequence of the  empty set. A set \(\Gamma\) of sentences is consistent if there  is no sentence \(\theta\) such that  \(\Gamma \vdash_D \theta\) and  \(\Gamma \vdash_D \neg \theta\).  That is, a set is consistent if it does not entail a pair of  contradictory opposite sentencess. Theorem 12. A set \(\Gamma\) is consistent if and only if there is a sentence \(\theta\) such that it is not the case that \(\Gamma \vdash \theta\). Proof: Suppose that \(\Gamma\) is consistent and let \(\theta\) be any sentence. Then either it is not the case that \(\Gamma \vdash \theta\) or it is not the case that \(\Gamma \vdash \neg \theta\).  For the converse, suppose that \(\Gamma\) is inconsistent and let \(\psi\) be any sentence. We have that there is a sentence such that both \(\Gamma \vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma \vdash \neg \theta\). By ex falso quodlibet (Theorem 10), \(\Gamma \vdash \psi\). Define a set \(\Gamma\) of sentences of the language \(\LKe\) to be maximally consistent if \(\Gamma\) is consistent and for every sentence \(\theta\) of \(\LKe\), if \(\theta\) is not in \(\Gamma\), then \(\Gamma,\theta\) is inconsistent. In other words, \(\Gamma\) is maximally consistent if \(\Gamma\) is consistent, and adding any sentence in the language not already in \(\Gamma\) renders it inconsistent. Notice that if \(\Gamma\) is maximally consistent then \(\Gamma \vdash \theta\) if and only if \(\theta\) is in \(\Gamma\). Theorem 13. The Lindenbaum Lemma.  Let \(\Gamma\) be any consistent set of sentences of \(\LKe .\) Then there is a set \(\Gamma'\) of sentences of \(\LKe\) such that \(\Gamma \subseteq \Gamma'\) and \(\Gamma'\) is maximally consistent. Proof: Although this theorem holds in general, we assume here that the set \(K\) of non-logical terminology is either finite or denumerably infinite (i.e., the size of the natural numbers, usually called \(\aleph_0)\).  It follows that there is an enumeration \(\theta_0, \theta_1,\ldots\) of the sentences of \(\LKe\), such that every sentence of \(\LKe\) eventually occurs in the list. Define a sequence of sets of sentences, by recursion, as follows: \(\Gamma_0\) is \(\Gamma\); for each natural number \(n\), if \(\Gamma_n, \theta_n\) is consistent, then let \(\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n, \theta_n\). Otherwise, let \(\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n\). Let \(\Gamma'\) be the union of all of the sets \(\Gamma_n\). Intuitively, the idea is to go through the sentences of \(\LKe\), throwing each one into \(\Gamma'\) if doing so produces a consistent set. Notice that each \(\Gamma_n\) is consistent. Suppose that \(\Gamma'\) is inconsistent. Then there is a sentence \(\theta\) such that \(\Gamma'\vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma'\vdash \neg \theta\). By Theorem 9 and Weakening (Theorem 8), there is finite subset \(\Gamma''\) of \(\Gamma'\) such that \(\Gamma''\vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma''\vdash \neg \theta\).  Because \(\Gamma''\) is finite, there is a natural number \(n\) such that every member of \(\Gamma''\) is in \(\Gamma_n\). So, by Weakening again, \(\Gamma_n \vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma_n \vdash \neg \theta\). So \(\Gamma_n\) is inconsistent, which contradicts the construction. So \(\Gamma'\) is consistent. Now suppose that a sentence \(\theta\) is not in \(\Gamma'\). We have to show that \(\Gamma', \theta\) is inconsistent. The sentence \(\theta\) must occur in the aforementioned list of sentences; say that \(\theta\) is \(\theta_m\).  Since \(\theta_m\) is not in \(\Gamma'\), then it is not in \(\Gamma_{m+1}\). This happens only if \(\Gamma_m, \theta_m\) is inconsistent. So a pair of contradictory opposites can be deduced from \(\Gamma_m,\theta_m\).  By Weakening, a pair of contradictory opposites can be deduced from \(\Gamma', \theta_m\). So \(\Gamma', \theta_m\) is inconsistent. Thus, \(\Gamma'\) is maximally consistent. Notice that this proof uses a principle corresponding to the law of excluded middle. In the construction of \(\Gamma'\), we assumed that, at each stage, either \(\Gamma_n\) is consistent or it is not. Intuitionists, who demur from excluded middle, do not accept the Lindenbaum lemma.
