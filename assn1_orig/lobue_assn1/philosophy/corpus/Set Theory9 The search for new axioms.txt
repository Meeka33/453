 As a result of 50 years of development of the forcing technique, and its applications to many open problems in mathematics, there are now literally thousands of questions, in practically all areas of mathematics, that have been shown independent of ZFC. These include almost all questions about the structure of uncountable sets. One might say that the undecidability phenomenon is pervasive, to the point that the investigation of the uncountable has been rendered nearly impossible in ZFC alone (see however Shelah (1994) for remarkable exceptions). This prompts the question about the truth-value of the statements that are undecided by ZFC. Should one be content with them being undecidable? Does it make sense at all to ask for their truth-value? There are several possible reactions to this. One is the skeptic’s position: the statements that are undecidable in ZFC have no definite answer; and they may even be inherently vague. Another, the common one among mathematicians, is Gödel’s position: the undecidability only shows that the ZFC system is too weak to answer those questions, and therefore one should search for new axioms that once added to ZFC would answer them. The search for new axioms has been known as Gödel’s Program. See Hauser (2006) for a thorough philosophical discussion of the Program, and also the entry on   large cardinals and determinacy  for philosophical considerations on the justification of new axioms for set theory. A central theme of set theory is thus the search and classification of new axioms. These fall currently into two main types: the axioms of large cardinals and the forcing axioms.
