 Modal logic has been useful in clarifying our understanding of central results concerning provability in the foundations of mathematics (Boolos, 1993). Provability logics are systems where the propositional variables \(p, q, r\), etc. range over formulas of some mathematical system, for example Peano’s system \(\mathbf{PA}\) for arithmetic. (The system chosen for mathematics might vary, but assume it is \(\mathbf{PA}\) for this discussion.) Gödel showed that arithmetic has strong expressive powers. Using code numbers for arithmetic sentences, he was able to demonstrate a correspondence between sentences of mathematics and facts about which sentences are and are not provable in \(\mathbf{PA}\). For example, he showed there there is a sentence \(C\) that is true just in case no contradiction is provable in \(\mathbf{PA}\) and there is a sentence \(G\) (the famous Gödel sentence) that is true just in case it is not provable in \(\mathbf{PA}\). In provability logics, \(\Box p\) is interpreted as a formula (of arithmetic) that expresses that what \(p\) denotes is provable in \(\mathbf{PA}\). Using this notation, sentences of provability logic express facts about provability. Suppose that \(\bot\) is a constant of provability logic denoting a contradiction. Then \({\sim}\Box \bot\) says that \(\mathbf{PA}\) is consistent and \(\Box A\rightarrow A\) says that \(\mathbf{PA}\) is sound in the sense that when it proves \(A, A\) is indeed true. Furthermore, the box may be iterated. So, for example, \(\Box{\sim}\Box \bot\) makes the dubious claim that \(\mathbf{PA}\) is able to prove its own consistency, and \({\sim}\Box \bot \rightarrow{\sim}\Box{\sim}\Box \bot\) asserts (correctly as Gödel proved) that if \(\mathbf{PA}\) is consistent then \(\mathbf{PA}\) is unable to prove its own consistency. Although provability logics form a family of related systems, the system \(\mathbf{GL}\) is by far the best known. It results from adding the following axiom to \(\bK\): The axiom (4): \(\Box A\rightarrow \Box \Box A\) is provable in \(\mathbf{GL}\), so \(\mathbf{GL}\) is actually a strengthening of \(\mathbf{K4}\). However, axioms such as \((M): \Box A\rightarrow A\), and even the weaker \((D): \Box A\rightarrow \Diamond A\) are not available (nor desirable) in \(\mathbf{GL}\). In provability logic, provability is not to be treated as a brand of necessity. The reason is that when \(p\) is provable in an arbitrary system \(\mathbf{S}\) for mathematics, it does not follow that \(p\) is true, since \(\mathbf{S}\) may be unsound. Furthermore, if \(p\) is provable in \(\mathbf{S} (\Box p)\) it need not even follow that \({\sim}p\) lacks a proof \(({\sim}\Box{\sim}p = \Diamond p). \mathbf{S}\) might be inconsistent and so prove both \(p\) and \({\sim}p\). Axiom \((GL)\) captures the content of Loeb’s Theorem, an important result in the foundations of arithmetic. \(\Box A\rightarrow A\) says that \(\mathbf{PA}\) is sound for \(A\), i.e. that if \(A\) were proven, A would be true. (Such a claim might not be secure for an arbitrarily selected system \(\mathbf{S}\), since A might be provable in \(\mathbf{S}\) and false.) \((GL)\) claims that if \(\mathbf{PA}\) manages to prove the sentence that claims soundness for a given sentence \(A\), then \(A\) is already provable in \(\mathbf{PA}\). Loeb’s Theorem reports a kind of modesty on \(\mathbf{PA}\)’s part (Boolos, 1993, p. 55). \(\mathbf{PA}\) never insists (proves) that a proof of \(A\) entails \(A\)’s truth, unless it already has a proof of \(A\) to back up that claim. It has been shown that \(\mathbf{GL}\) is adequate for provability in the following sense. Let a sentence of \(\mathbf{GL}\) be always provable exactly when the sentence of arithmetic it denotes is provable no matter how its variables are assigned values to sentences of \(\mathbf{PA}\). Then the provable sentences of \(\mathbf{GL}\) are exactly the sentences that are always provable. This adequacy result has been extremely useful, since general questions concerning provability in \(\mathbf{PA}\) can be transformed into easier questions about what can be demonstrated in \(\mathbf{GL}\). \(\mathbf{GL}\) can also be outfitted with a possible world semantics for which it is sound and complete. A corresponding condition on frames for \(\mathbf{GL}\)-validity is that the frame be transitive, finite and irreflexive.
