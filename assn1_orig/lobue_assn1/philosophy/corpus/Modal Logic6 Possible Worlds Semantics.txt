 The purpose of logic is to characterize the difference between valid and invalid arguments. A logical system for a language is a set of axioms and rules designed to prove exactly the valid arguments statable in the language. Creating such a logic may be a difficult task. The logician must make sure that the system is sound, i.e. that every argument proven using the rules and axioms is in fact valid. Furthermore, the system should be complete, meaning that every valid argument has a proof in the system. Demonstrating soundness and completeness of formal systems is a logician’s central concern. Such a demonstration cannot get underway until the concept of validity is defined rigorously. Formal semantics for a logic provides a definition of validity by characterizing the truth behavior of the sentences of the system. In propositional logic, validity can be defined using truth tables. A valid argument is simply one where every truth table row that makes its premises true also makes its conclusion true. However truth tables cannot be used to provide an account of validity in modal logics because there are no truth tables for expressions such as ‘it is necessary that’, ‘it is obligatory that’, and the like. (The problem is that the truth value of \(A\) does not determine the truth value for \(\Box A\). For example, when \(A\) is ‘Dogs are dogs’, \(\Box A\) is true, but when \(A\) is ‘Dogs are pets’, \(\Box A\) is false.) Nevertheless, semantics for modal logics can be defined by introducing possible worlds. We will illustrate possible worlds semantics for a logic of necessity containing the symbols \({\sim}, \rightarrow\), and \(\Box\). Then we will explain how the same strategy may be adapted to other logics in the modal family. In propositional logic, a valuation of the atomic sentences (or row of a truth table) assigns a truth value \((T\) or \(F)\) to each propositional variable \(p\). Then the truth values of the complex sentences are calculated with truth tables. In modal semantics, a set \(W\) of possible worlds is introduced. A valuation then gives a truth value to each propositional variable for each of the possible worlds in \(W\). This means that value assigned to \(p\) for world \(w\) may differ from the value assigned to \(p\) for another world \(w'\). The truth value of the atomic sentence \(p\) at world \(w\) given by the valuation \(v\) may be written \(v(p, w)\). Given this notation, the truth values \((T\) for true, \(F\) for false) of complex sentences of modal logic for a given valuation \(v\) (and member \(w\) of the set of worlds \(W)\) may be defined by the following truth clauses. (‘iff’ abbreviates ‘if and only if’.) Clauses \(({\sim})\) and \((\rightarrow)\) simply describe the standard truth table behavior for negation and material implication respectively. According to (5), \(\Box A\) is true (at a world \(w)\) exactly when \(A\) is true in all possible worlds. Given the definition of \(\Diamond\), (namely, \(\Diamond A = {\sim}\Box{\sim}A)\) the truth condition (5) insures that \(\Diamond A\) is true just in case \(A\) is true in some possible world. Since the truth clauses for \(\Box\) and \(\Diamond\) involve the quantifiers ‘all’ and ‘some’ (respectively), the parallels in logical behavior between \(\Box\) and \(\forall x\), and between \(\Diamond\) and \(\exists x\) noted in section 2 will be expected. Clauses \(({\sim}), (\rightarrow)\), and (5) allow us to calculate the truth value of any sentence at any world on a given valuation. A definition of validity is now just around the corner. An argument is 5-valid for a given set W (of possible worlds) if and only if every valuation of the atomic sentences that assigns the premises \(T\) at a world in \(W\) also assigns the conclusion \(T\) at the same world. An argument is said to be 5-valid iff it is valid for every non empty set \(W\) of possible worlds. It has been shown that \(\mathbf{S5}\) is sound and complete for 5-validity (hence our use of the symbol ‘5’). The 5-valid arguments are exactly the arguments provable in \(\mathbf{S5}\). This result suggests that \(\mathbf{S5}\) is the correct way to formulate a logic of necessity. However, \(\mathbf{S5}\) is not a reasonable logic for all members of the modal family. In deontic logic, temporal logic, and others, the analog of the truth condition (5) is clearly not appropriate; furthermore there are even conceptions of necessity where (5) should be rejected as well. The point is easiest to see in the case of temporal logic. Here, the members of \(W\) are moments of time, or worlds “frozen”, as it were, at an instant. For simplicity let us consider a future temporal logic, a logic where \(\Box A\) reads: ‘it will always be the case that’. (We formulate the system using \(\Box\) rather than the traditional \(G\) so that the connections with other modal logics will be easier to appreciate.) The correct clause for \(\Box\) should say that \(\Box A\) is true at time \(w\) iff \(A\) is true at all times in the future of \(w\). To restrict attention to the future, the relation \(R\) (for ‘earlier than’) needs to be introduced. Then the correct clause can be formulated as follows. This says that \(\Box A\) is true at \(w\) just in case \(A\) is true at all times after \(w\). Validity for this brand of temporal logic can now be defined. A frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\) is a pair consisting of a non-empty set \(W\) (of worlds) and a binary relation \(R\) on \(W\). A model \(\langle F, v\rangle\) consists of a frame \(F\), and a valuation \(v\) that assigns truth values to each atomic sentence at each world in \(W\). Given a model, the values of all complex sentences can be determined using \(({\sim}), (\rightarrow)\), and \((K)\). An argument is \(\bK\)-valid just in case any model whose valuation assigns the premises \(T\) at a world also assigns the conclusion \(T\) at the same world. As the reader may have guessed from our use of ‘\(\bK\)’, it has been shown that the simplest modal logic \(\bK\) is both sound and complete for \(\bK\)-validity.
