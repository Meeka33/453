 The desire to retain the possibility of a computational interpretation is one motivation for using the constructive reinterpretations of the logical connectives and quantifiers that we gave above; but it is not exactly the motivation of the pioneers of constructivism in mathematics. In this section we look at some of the different approaches to constructivism in mathematics over the past 130 years. In the late nineteenth century, certain individuals—most notably Kronecker and Poincaré—had expressed doubts about, or even disapproval of, the idealistic, nonconstructive methods used by some of their contemporaries; but it is in the polemical writings of  L.E.J. Brouwer  (1881–1966), beginning with his Amsterdam doctoral thesis, Brouwer [1907], and continuing over the next forty-seven years, that the foundations of a precise, systematic approach to constructive mathematics were laid. In Brouwer’s philosophy, known as intuitionism, mathematics is a free creation of the human mind, and an object exists if and only if it can be (mentally) constructed. If one takes that philosophical stance, then one is inexorably drawn to the foregoing constructive interpretation of the logical connectives and quantifiers: for how could a proof of the impossibility of the non-existence of a certain object \(x\) describe a mental construction of \(x\)? Brouwer was not the clearest expositor of his ideas, as is shown by the following quotation: A modern version of Brouwer’s view was given by Errett Bishop (Bishop [1967], p. 2): However obscure Brouwer’s writings could be, one thing was always clear: for him, mathematics took precedence over logic. One might say, as Hermann Weyl did in the following passage, that Brouwer saw classical mathematics as flawed precisely in its use of classical logic without reference to the underlying mathematics: In particular, this misuse of logic led to nonconstructive existence proofs which, in Weyl’s words, “inform the world that a treasure exists without disclosing its location”. In order to describe the logic used by the intuitionist mathematician, it was necessary first to analyse the mathematical processes of the mind, from which analysis the logic could be extracted. In 1930, Brouwer’s most famous pupil, Arend Heyting, published a set of formal axioms which so clearly characterise the logic used by the intuitionist that they have become universally known as the axioms for  intuitionistic logic  (Heyting [1930]). These axioms captured the informal BHK-interpretation of the connectives and quantifiers that we gave earlier. Intuitionistic mathematics diverges from other types of constructive mathematics in its interpretation of the term “sequence”. Normally, a sequence in constructive mathematics is given by a rule which determines, in advance, how to construct each of its terms; such a sequence may be said to be lawlike or predeterminate. Brouwer generalised this notion of a sequence to include the possibility of constructing the terms one-by-one, the choice of each term being made freely, or subject only to certain restrictions stipulated in advance. Most manipulations of sequences do not require that they be predeterminate, and can be performed on these more general free choice sequences. Thus, for the intuitionist, a real number \(\bx = (x_1 ,x_2,\ldots)\)—essentially, a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers—need not be given by a rule: its terms \(x_1 ,x_2,\ldots\), are simply rational numbers, successively constructed, subject only to some kind of Cauchy restriction such as the following one used by Bishop [1967]: Once free choice sequences are admitted into mathematics, so, perhaps to one’s initial surprise, are certain strong choice principles. Let \(P\) be a subset of \(\bN^{\bN} \times \bN\) (where \(\bN\) denotes the set of natural numbers and, for sets \(A\) and \(B, B^A\) denotes the set of mappings from \(A\) into \(B)\), and suppose that for each \(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\) there exists \(n \in \bN\) such that \((\ba,n) \in P\). From a constructive point of view, this means that we have a procedure, applicable to sequences, that computes \(n\) for any given \(\ba\). According to Brouwer, the construction of an element of \(\bN^{\bN}\) is forever incomplete: a generic sequence \(\ba\) is purely extensional, in the sense that at any given moment we can know nothing about \(\ba\) other than a finite set of its terms. It follows that our procedure must be able to calculate, from some finite initial sequence \((a_0 ,\ldots ,a_N)\) of terms of \(\ba\), a natural number \(n\) such that \(P(\ba,n)\). If \(\bb \in \bN^{\bN}\) is any sequence such that \(b_{k} = a_{k}\) for \(0 \le k \le N\), then our procedure must return the same \(n\) for \(\bb\) as it does for \(\ba\). This means that \(n\) is a continuous function of \(\ba\) with respect to the topology on \(\bN^{\bN}\) given by the metric We are therefore led to the following principle of continuous choice, which we divide into a continuity part and a choice part. CC1 : Any function from \(\bN^{\bN}\) to \(\bN\) is continuous. CC2 : If \(P \subseteq \bN^{\bN} \times \bN\), and for each \(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\) there exists \(n \in \bN\) such that \((\ba,n) \in P\), then there is a function \(f : \bN^{\bN} \rightarrow \bN\) such that \((\ba,f(\ba)) \in P\) for all \(\ba \in \bN^{\bN}\). If \(P\) and \(f\) are as in CC2, then we say that \(f\) is a choice function for \(P\). The omniscience principles LPO and LLPO are demonstrably false under the hypotheses CC1–2; but MP is consistent with it. Among the remarkable consequences of CC1–2 are the following. exists. Then there exists \(c \gt 0\) such that \(\lVert u_n (x)\rVert \le c\) for all \(n\in \bN\) and all unit vectors \(x\) of \(X\) (Uniform boundedness principle). Each of these statements appears to contradict known classical theorems. However, the comparison with classical mathematics should not be made superficially: in order to understand that there is no real contradiction here, we must appreciate that the meaning of such terms as “function” and even “real number” in intuitionistic mathematics is quite different from that in the classical setting. (In practice, intuitionistic mathematics cannot be compared, readily and directly, with classical mathematics.) Brouwer’s introspection over the nature of functions and the continuum led him to a second principle, which, unlike that of continuous choice, is classically valid. This principle requires a little more background for its explanation. For any set \(S\) we denote by \(S^*\) the set of all finite sequences of elements of \(S\), including the empty sequence \((\ )\). If \(\alpha = (a_1 ,\ldots ,a_n)\) is in \(S^*\), then \(n\) is called the length of \(\alpha\) and is denoted by \(\abs{\alpha}\). If \(m \in \bN\), and \(\alpha\) is a finite or infinite sequence in \(S\) of length at least \(m\), then we denote by \(\bar{\alpha}(m)\) the finite sequence consisting of the first \(m\) terms of \(\alpha\).  Note that \(\bar{\alpha}(0) = (\ )\) and \(\abs{\bar{\alpha}(0)}\) = 0 . If \(\alpha \in S^*\) and \(\beta = \bar{\alpha}(m)\) for some \(m\), we say that \(\alpha\) is an extension of \(\beta\), and that \(\beta\) is a restriction of \(\alpha\). A subset \(\sigma\) of \(S\) is said to be detachable (from \(S)\) if A detachable subset \(\sigma\) of \(\bN^*\) is called a fan if is finite or empty, where \(\alpha^* n\) denotes the finite sequence obtained by adjoining the natural number \(n\) to the terms of \(\alpha\). A path in a fan \(\sigma\) is a sequence \(\alpha\), finite or infinite, such that \(\bar{\alpha}(n) \in \sigma\) for each applicable \(n\). We say that a path \(\alpha\) is blocked by a subset \(B\) if some restriction of \(\alpha\) is in \(B\); if no restriction of \(\alpha\) is in \(B\), we say that \(\alpha\)  misses \(B\). A subset \(B\) of a fan \(\sigma\) is called a bar for \(\sigma\) if each infinite path of \(\sigma\) is blocked by \(B\); a bar \(B\) for \(\sigma\) is uniform if there exists \(n \in \bN\) such that each path of length \(n\) is blocked by \(B\). At last we can state Brouwer’s next principle of intuitionism, the fan theorem for detachable bars (FT\(_D\)): Every detachable bar of a fan is uniform. In its classical contrapositive form, FT\(_D\) is known as König’s Lemma: if for every \(n\) there exists a path of length \(n\) that misses \(B\), then there exists an infinite path that misses \(B\) (see Dummett 1977 [2000], 49–53). (Of course, classically the condition of detachability is superfluous.) It is simple to construct a Brouwerian counterexample to König’s Lemma. Brouwer actually posited the fan theorem without the restriction of detachability of the bar. Attempts to prove that more general fan theorem constructively rely on an analysis of how we could know that a subset is a bar, and led Brouwer to a notion of bar induction; this is discussed in Section 3.6 of the entry  on intuitionism in the philosophy of mathematics;  another good reference for bar induction is van Atten (2004).  We shall return to fan theorems in Section 4. Of the many applications of Brouwer’s principles, the most famous is his uniform continuity theorem (which follows from the pointwise continuity consequences of CC1-2 together a form of fan theorem more general than FT\(_D)\): The reader is warned once again to interpret this carefully within Brouwer’s intuitionistic framework, and not to jump to the erroneous conclusion that intuitionism contradicts classical mathematics. It is more sensible to regard the two types of mathematics as incomparable. For further discussion, see the entry on  intuitionistic logic. Unfortunately — and perhaps inevitably, in the face of opposition from mathematicians of such stature as Hilbert — Brouwer’s intuitionist school of mathematics and philosophy became more and more involved in what, at least to classical mathematicians, appeared to be quasi-mystical speculation about the nature of constructive thought, to the detriment of the practice of constructive mathematics itself. This unfortunate polarisation between the Brouwerians and the Hilbertians culminated in the notorious Grundlagenstreit of the 1920s, details of which can be found in the Brouwer biographies by van Dalen [1999, 2005] and van Stigt [1990]. In the late 1940s, the Russian mathematician A.A. Markov began the development of an alternative form of constructive mathematics (RUSS), which is, essentially,  recursive function  theory with intuitionistic logic (Markov [1954], Kushner [1985]). In this variety the objects are defined by means of Gödel-numberings, and the procedures are all recursive; the main distinction between RUSS and the classical recursive analysis developed after the work of Turing, Church, and others in 1936 clarified the nature of computable processes is that the logic used in RUSS is intuitionistic. One obstacle faced by the mathematician attempting to come to grips with RUSS is that, being expressed in the language of recursion theory, it is not easily readable; indeed, on opening a page of Kushner’s excellent lectures [1985], one might be forgiven for wondering whether this is analysis or logic. (This remark should be tempered with reference to the two relatively readable books on classical recursive analysis by Aberth [1980, 2001].) Fortunately, one can get to the heart of RUSS by an axiomatic approach due to Richman [1983] (see also Chapter 3 of Bridges & Richman [1987]). First, we define a set \(S\) to be countable if there is a mapping from a detachable subset of \(\bN\) onto \(S\). With intuitionistic logic we cannot prove that every subset of \(\bN\) is detachable (the reader is invited to provide a Brouwerian example to demonstrate this). Countable subsets of \(\bN\) in Richman’s axiomatic approach are the counterparts of recursively enumerable sets in the normal development of RUSS. By a partial function on \(\bN\) we mean a mapping whose domain is a subset of \(\bN\); if the domain is \(\bN\) itself, then we call the function a total partial function on \(\bN\). Richman’s approach to RUSS is based on intuitionistic logic and a single axiom of computable partial functions (CPF): There is an enumeration \(\phi_0 ,\phi_1,\ldots\) of the set of all partial functions from \(\bN\) to \(\bN\) with countable domains. It is remarkable what can be deduced cleanly and quickly using this principle. For example, we can prove the following result, which almost immediately shows that LLPO, and hence LPO, are false in the recursive setting. Of more interest, however, are results such as the following within RUSS. From a classical viewpoint, these results fit into place when one realises that words such as “function” and “real number” should be interpreted as “recursive function” and “recursive real number” respectively. Note that the second of the above four recursive theorems is a strong recursive counterexample to the open-cover compactness property of the (recursive) real line; and the fourth is a recursive counterexample to the classical theorem that every uniformly continuous mapping of a compact set into \(\bR\) attains its infimum. Progress in all varieties of constructive mathematics was relatively slow throughout the next decade and a half. What was needed to raise the profile of constructivism in mathematics was a top-ranking classical mathematician to show that a thoroughgoing constructive development of deep analysis was possible without a commitment to Brouwer’s non-classical principles or to the machinery of recursive function theory. This need was fulfilled in 1967, with the appearance of Errett Bishop’s monograph Foundations of Constructive Analysis [1967], the product of an astonishing couple of years in which, working in the informal but rigorous style used by normal analysts, Bishop provided a constructive development of a large part of twentieth-century analysis, including the Stone-Weierstrass Theorem, the Hahn-Banach and separation theorems, the spectral theorem for self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, the Lebesgue convergence theorems for abstract integrals, Haar measure and the abstract Fourier transform, ergodic theorems, and the elements of Banach algebra theory. (See also Bishop & Bridges [1985].) Thus, at a stroke, he gave the lie to the commonly-held view expressed so forcefully by Hilbert: Not only did Bishop’s mathematics BISH have the advantage of readability — if you open Bishop’s book at any page, what you see is clearly recognisable as analysis, even if, from time to time, his moves in the course of a proof may appear strange to one schooled in the use of the law of excluded middle — but, unlike intuitionistic or recursive mathematics, it admits many different interpretations. Intuitionistic mathematics, recursive constructive mathematics, and even classical mathematics all provide models of BISH. In fact, the results and proofs in BISH can be interpreted, with at most minor amendments, in any reasonable model of computable mathematics, such as, for example, Weihrauch’s Type Two Effectivity Theory (Weihrauch [2000]; Bauer [2005]). How is this multiple interpretability achieved? At least in part by Bishop’s refusal to pin down his primitive notion of “algorithm” or, in his words, “finite routine”. This refusal has led to the criticism that his approach lacks the precision that a logician would normally expect of a foundational system. However, this criticism can be overcome by looking more closely at what practitioners of BISH actually do when they prove theorems: in practice, they are doing mathematics with intuitionistic logic. Experience shows that the restriction to intuitionistic logic always forces mathematicians to work in a manner that, at least informally, can be described as algorithmic; so algorithmic mathematics appears to be equivalent to mathematics that uses only intuitionistic logic. If that is the case, then we can practice constructive mathematics using intuitionistic logic on any reasonably defined mathematical objects, not just some class of “constructive objects”. This view, more or less, appears to have first been put forward by Richman [1990, 1996]. Taking the logic as the primary characteristic of constructive mathematics, it does not reflect the primacy of mathematics over logic that was part of the belief of Brouwer, Heyting, Markov, Bishop, and other pioneers of constructivism. On the other hand, it does capture the essence of constructive mathematics in practice. Thus one might distinguish between the ontological constructivism of Brouwer and others who are led to constructive mathematics through a belief that mathematical objects are mental creations, and the epistemological constructivism of Richman and those who see constructive mathematics as characterised by its methodology, based on the use of intuitionistic logic. Of course, the former approach to constructivism inevitably leads to the latter; and the latter is certainly not inconsistent with a Brouwerian ontology. To do actual mathematics we need more than just intutionistic logic. For Bishop, the building blocks of mathematics were the positive integers (see the quote from Bishop [1967] in Section 3.1 above). Among the early formal systems for BISH were Myhill’s [1975] axiomatic foundation based on primitive notions of number, set, and function; Feferman’s [1975] system for explicit mathematics; and Friedman’s [1977] intuitionistic ZF set theory. The two most favoured formal underpinnings of BISH at this stage are the CZF set theory of Aczel and Rathjen [2000], and the  intuitionistic type theory of Martin-Löf [1975, 1984]. Before ending our tour of varieties of modern constructive mathematics, we visit a fourth variety, based on Per Martin-Löf’s intuitionistic type theory (ML).  Martin-Löf published his Notes on Constructive Mathematics [1968], based on lectures he had given in Europe in 1966–68; so his involvement with constructivism in mathematics goes back at least to the period of Bishop’s writing of Foundations of Constructive Analysis. Martin-Löf’s book is in the spirit of RUSS, rather than BISH; indeed, its author did not have access to Bishop’s book until his own manuscript was finished. Martin-Löf later turned his attention to his theory of types as a foundation for Bishop-style constructive mathematics. Here, in his own words, is an informal explanation of the ideas underlying ML: In particular, in this system every proposition can be represented as a type: namely, the type of proofs of the proposition. Conversely, each type determines a proposition: namely, the proposition that the type in question is inhabited. So when we think of a certain type \(T\) as a proposition, we interpret the formula as “\(x\) is a proof of the proposition \(T\)”. Martin-Löf goes on to construct new types, such as Cartesian products and disjoint unions, from old. For example, the Cartesian product is the type of functions that take an arbitrary object \(x\) of type \(A\) into an object of type \(B(x)\). In the propositions-as-proofs interpretation, where \(B(x)\) represents a proposition, the above Cartesian product corresponds to the universal proposition Martin-Löf distinguishes carefully between proofs and derivations: a proof object is a witness to the fact that some proposition has been proved; whereas a derivation is the record of the construction of a proof object. Also, he exercises two basic forms (one dare not say “types” here) of judgement. The first is a relation between proof objects and propositions, the second a property of some propositions. In the first case, the judgement is either one that a proof object \(a\) is a witness to a proposition \(A\), or else one that two proof objects \(a\) and \(b\) are equal and both witness that \(A\) has been proved. The first case of the second form of judgement states that a proposition \(A\) is well-formed, and the second records that two propositions \(A\) and \(B\) are equal. There is a careful, and highly detailed, set of rules for formalising ML. We will not go into those here, but refer the reader to other sources such as Sambin & Smith [1998]. When actually doing constructive mathematics in type theory, one often needs to equip completely presented sets (types) with an equivalence relation, the combination being known as a setoid. Mappings are then functions that respect those equivalence relations. This is in close agreement with the way Bishop presented his informal theory of sets. The dependent types of Martin-Löf are useful for constructing subsets. For instance, the real numbers can be constructed using the \(\Sigma\)-type (see Martin-Löf [1984]): An element of this type \(B\) is thereby a pair consisting of a convergent sequence \(\bx\) of rationals and a proof \(p\) that it is convergent. A suitable equivalence relation \({\sim}\) on \(R\) is defined by taking \((x,p)\sim(y,q)\) to mean The resulting setoid of real numbers is \(\bR = (R,{\sim})\). We can readily prove that and then, using the type-theoretic axiom of choice (see Section 4 below), find a function \(f : \bR\rightarrow \bZ\) such that \(f(x) \lt x \lt f(x)+2\). However, there is no reason to believe that the function \(f\) respects the equivalence relations—that is, that \(f(x) = f(y)\) holds if \(x \sim y\). Every constructive proof embodies an algorithm that, in principle, can be extracted and recast as a computer program; moreover, the constructive proof is itself a verification that the algorithm is correct — that is, meets its specification. One major advantage of Martin-Löf’s formal approach to constructive mathematics is that it greatly facilitates the extraction of programs from proofs. This has led to serious work on the implementation of constructive mathematics in various locations (see Martin-Löf [1980], Constable [1986], Hayashi & Nakano [1988], Schwichtenberg [2009]). Some recent implementations of type theory for proof extraction are Coq and Agda (see the links in Other Internet Resources).
