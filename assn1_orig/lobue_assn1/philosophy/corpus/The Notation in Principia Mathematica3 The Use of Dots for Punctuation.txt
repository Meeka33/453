 An immediate obstacle to reading PM is the unfamiliar use of dots for punctuation, instead of the more common parentheses and brackets. The system is precise, and can be learned with just a little practice. The use of dots for punctuation is not unique to PM. Originating with Peano, it was later used in works by Alonzo Church, W.V.O. Quine, and others, but it has now largely disappeared. (The use of dots of some historical interest, as Alan Turing made a study of the use of dots from a computational point of view in 1942, presumably in his spare time after a day's work at Bletchley Park breaking the codes of the Enigma Machine.) The best way to learn to use it is to look at a few samples which are translated to formulae using parentheses, and thus to get the feel for it. What follows is an explanation as presented in PM, pages 9–10, followed by a number of examples which illustrate each of its clauses: Consider the following series of extended examples, in which we examine propositions in PM and then discuss how to translate them step by step into modern notation. (Symbols below are sometimes used as names for themselves, thus avoiding some otherwise needed quotation marks. Russell is often accused of confusing use and mention, so there may well be some danger in this practice.) This is the second assertion of “star” 1. It is in fact an axiom or “Primitive Proposition” as indicated by the ’\(\Pp\)’. That this is an assertion (axiom or theorem) and not a definition is indicated by the use of “\(\vdash\)”. (By contrast, a definition would omit the assertion sign but conclude with a “\(\Df\)” sign.) Now the first step in the process of translating ∗1·2 into modern notation is to note the colon. Recall, from the above quoted passage, that “a larger number of dots indicates an outside bracket, a smaller number indicates an inside bracket”. Thus, the colon here (which consists of a larger number of dots than the single dots occurring on the line in ∗1·2) represents an outside bracket. So, the first step is to translate ∗1·2 to: So the brackets “[” and “]” represent the colon in ∗1·2. The scope of the colon thus extends past any smaller number of dots (i.e., one dot) to the end of the formula. Since formulas are read from left to right the expression “past” means “to the right of”. Next, the dots around the “\(\supset\)” are represented in modern notation by the parenthesis around the antecedent and consequent. Recall, in the above passage, we find “… dots only work away from the adjacent sign of disjunction, implication, or equivalence …”. Thus, the next step in the translation process is to move to the formula:   \[ \vdash [(p \lor p) \supset(p)] \] Finally, standard modern conventions allow us to delete the outer brackets and the parentheses around single letters, yielding: Our next example involves conjunction, which is indicated by simple juxtaposition of atomic sentences, or with a dot when a substitution instance might be considered, as in the definition of conjunction in the following: Here we have a case in which dots occur indicate both a “logical product” (i.e., conjunction) and delimiting brackets. As a first step in translating ∗3·01 into modern notation, we replace the first dot by an ampersand (and its corresponding scope delimiters) and replace “\(\ldot {=} \ldot\)” by “\(=_{df}\)”, to yield: The above step clearly illustrates how a “dot indicating a logical product has a scope which works both backwards and forwards”. Note that the first dot in ∗3·01, i.e., between the \(p\) and \(q\), is really optional, given the above quotation from PM. However, since we may sometimes want to substitute entire formulas for \(p\) and \(q\), the dot indicates the extent of the substituted formulas. Thus, we might have, as a substitution instance: \(r \lor s \sdot q \supset s\) (in PM notation) or \((r \lor s) \amp(q \supset s)\) (in contemporary symbols). Finally, our modern conventions allow us to eliminate the outer parentheses from the definiendum and the brackets “[” and “]” from the definiens, yielding: Notice that the scope of the negation sign “\(\osim \)” in ∗3·01 is not indicated with dots, even in the PM system, but rather requires parentheses. If we apply the rule “dots only work away from the adjacent sign of disjunction, implication, or equivalence, or forward from the adjacent symbol of one of the other kinds enumerated in Group II” (where Group II includes “\((\exists x)\)”), then the modern equivalent would be:   \[ \osim (x)\phi x =_{df} (\exists x)\osim \phi x \]   or   \[ \osim \forall x\phi x =_{df} \exists x\osim \phi x \] The ranking of connectives in terms of relative “force”, or scope, is a standard convention in contemporary logic. If there are no explicit parentheses to indicate the scope of a connective those which have precedence in the ranking are presumed to be the principal connective, and so on for subformulas. Thus, instead formulating the following DeMorgan’s law as the cumbersome: we nowadays write it as: This simpler formulation is natural because \(\equiv\) takes precedence over (has wider “scope” than) \(\lor\) and &, and the latter take precedence over \(\osim \). Indeed parentheses are often unneeded around \(\equiv\), given a further convention on which \(\equiv\) takes precedence over \(\supset\). Thus, the formula \(p \supset q \equiv\osim p\lor q\) becomes unambiguous. We might represent these conventions by listing the connectives in groups with those with widest scope at the top: For Whitehead and Russell, however, the symbols \(\supset\), \(\equiv\), \(\lor\) and \(\ldots =\ldots \Df\), in Group I, are of equal force. Group II consists of the variable binding expressions, quantifiers and scope indicators for definite descriptions, and Group III consists of conjunctions. Negation is below all of these. So the ranking in PM would be: This is what Whitehead and Russell seem to mean when they say “Group I is of greater force than Group II, and Group II than Group III.” Consider the following: This theorem illustrates how to read multiple uses of the same number of dots within one formula. Grouping “associates to the left” both for dots and for a series of disjunctions, following the convention of reading from left to right and the definition: So, in ∗3·12, the first two dots around the \(\lor\) simply “work away” from the connective. The second “extends” until it meets with the next of the same number (the third single dot). That third dot, and the fourth “work away” from the second \(\lor\), and the final dot indicates a conjunction with narrowest scope. The result, formulated with all possible punctuation for maximum explicitness, is: If we employ all the standard conventions for dropping parentheses, this becomes: This illustrates the passage in the above quotation which says “The scope of the bracket indicated by any collection of dots extends backwards or forwards beyond any smaller number of dots, or any equal number from a group of less force, until we reach either the end of the asserted proposition or a greater number of dots or an equal number belonging to a group of equal or superior force.” Before we look at a wider range of examples, a detailed example involving quantified variables will prove to be instructive. Whitehead and Russell follow Peano’s practice of expressing universally quantified conditionals (such as “All \(\phi\)s are \(\psi\)s”) with the bound variable subscripted under the conditional sign. Similarly with universally quantified biconditionals (“All and only \(\phi\)s are \(\psi\)s”). That is, the expressions “\(\phi x \supset_x \psi x\)” and “\(\phi x \equiv_x \psi x\)” are defined as follows: and correspond to the following more modern formulas, respectively: As an exercise the reader might be inclined to formulate a rigorous algorithm for converting PM into a particular contemporary symbolism (with conventions for dropping parentheses), but the best way to learn the system is to look over a few more examples of translations, and then simply begin to read formulae directly. In the examples below, each formula number is followed first by Principia notation and then its modern translation. Notice that in ∗1·5 parentheses are used for punctuation in addition to dots. (Primitive Propositions ∗1·2, ∗1·3, ∗1·4, ∗1·5, and ∗1·6 together constitute the axioms for propositional logic in PM. ) Proposition ∗1·5 was shown to be redundant by Paul Bernays in 1926. It can be derived from appropriate instances of the others and the rule of modus ponens.
