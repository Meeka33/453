 The second-order theory of even the empty vocabulary is undecidable, as we noted in  §5.1.  In contrast, monadic second-order logic gives rise to many important decidability results. Let us first observe that (not only in the empty vocabulary but also) in a monadic vocabulary, i.e., one consisting of monadic predicates only, monadic second-order logic is certainly decidable as proved already in 1915 by Löwenheim (1915) in one of the earliest papers on the mathematical aspects of formal logic. Löwenheim’s result can be proved easily by quantifier elimination, or alternatively by the more recent method of Ehrenfeucht-Fraïssé-games (see  §3).  However, monadic third (and higher) order logic in monadic vocabulary, with quantifiers over not only subsets and also over sets of subsets of the domain, is undecidable (Tharp 1973). We now focus on vocabularies which are not merely monadic. Compared to a monadic vocabulary, the other extreme can be described as follows: Let P be a ternary predicate (a “pairing function”) on a non-empty set S. Suppose that for every \(x,y\in S\) there is \(z\in S\) with \((x, y, z) \in P\) and for every \(z\in S\) there is at most one pair \((x, y)\) with \((x, y, z) \in P\). Then the true (full) second-order theory of S is interpretable in the monadic theory of \((S, P)\) (Gurevich 1985). In other words, in a context where a pairing function is present, as in set theory and number theory, no special advantage arises from limiting second-order logic to its monadic fragment. The next step from a vocabulary consisting of only monadic predicates is a vocabulary with exactly one unary function. To describe some highly non-trivial results in this case we introduce the following concept, which has independent interest: The spectrum of a first or second-order sentence is the set of cardinalities of its finite models. Spectra were introduced by Scholz, see Durand, Jones, Makowsky, and More (2012) for a history. A spectrum is of course always recursive. In fact, a set of natural numbers is a spectrum of a first order sentence iff it is in NEXPTIME, that is, recognizable by a nondeterministic Turing machine in exponential time (Jones & Selman 1974). In the case of sentences with just one unary function symbol there is a surprising characterization. Let us call a set S of natural numbers eventually periodic if there are natural numbers N and p with \(p > 0\) such that for every n with \(n > N\), we have \(n \in S\) iff \(n +p \in S\). Theorem 10 (Durand, Fagin, & Loescher 1998; Shelah 2004) Suppose the vocabulary has just one unary function. Then a set of natural numbers is the spectrum of a monadic second-order sentence if and only if it is the spectrum of a first order sentence if and only if it is eventually periodic. In graphs monadic second-order logic can still express most interesting properties. For example, the connectivity of the graph (here E is the edge relation) can be expressed by the sentence and the 3-colorability of the graph by the sentence There is a wealth of decidability results of monadic second-order logic on linear orders, trees and graphs. Theorem 11 (Büchi 1962; Elgot 1961; Rabin 1968) The monadic second-order theory of \((\oN,s)\), i.e., the successor function on \(\oN\) and of the full infinite binary tree, i.e., two successor functions on \(\oN\), are both decidable. The proof goes via a reduction to automata. An automaton is a restricted form of a Turing machine. In an automaton the machine never writes on the tape, so the tape just contains the input (Rabin & Scott 1959). However, the computation may be infinite. The input is considered accepted in the case of an infinite computation if an accepting state is reached infinitely many times. (There are also more complicated criteria of acceptance). With monadic second-order logic we can guess an accepting computation of the automaton. It is possible but more difficult to show that an automaton can check the truth of a monadic second-order sentence. The monadic second-order theory of ordinals \((\alpha,<)\) have been studied extensively from the point of view of decidability. For example, the monadic second-order theory of all countable ordinals, the theory of \(\omega_1\), and the theory of all ordinals \(<\omega_2\) are decidable (Büchi 1973), but ZFC cannot decide whether the monadic second-order theory of \(\omega_2\) is decidable (Gurevich, Magidor, & Shelah 1983).
