 Wittgenstein was a keen student of Frege’s work, directed to further his studies under Bertrand Russell by Frege himself in the course of a visit he made to see Frege in Jena. One might, then, think him inoculated against formalism. But definite formalistic elements surface in Wittgenstein’s Tractatus. True, the Tractatus is a notoriously difficult work to interpret. Even the question as to whether the main portion of the book, essentially all of it other than the ‘frame’ of the preface and the end, is to be taken as a serious attempt to present a metaphysics is controversial. If we leave that hermeneutic controversy aside, and consider the metaphysics which is offered to us, the formalistic aspects one finds are twofold. Firstly, mathematical sentences are said to express ‘pseudo-propositions’, and so are devoid of truth value (only contingent propositions have a truth value). Secondly, mathematics is described as a ‘calculus’ which is not to be used to represent the world as it is in itself but whose value is entirely instrumental. To be sure, the most explicit statement of this is not in the Tractatus but in comments Wittgenstein wrote on Ramsey’s copy of it: In the Tractatus proper we do get the idea that mathematical propositions are mere instruments (all of mathematics, not just an ‘ideal’ fragment, as in Hilbert): This idea is prefaced by the statements: Care must be taken, however. Wittgenstein distinguishes utterances which are sinnlos, which lack sense (including logical tautologies and contradictions here) from those which are unsinnig, nonsensical; it is not clear into which class mathematical utterances fall. One might well think that the game formalist should treat mathematical utterances, on that view just strings of meaningless marks, as unsinnig, not just sinnlos. One clear difference from game formalism however is this: for Wittgenstein mathematics should not be conceived of as a calculus separate from other uses of language. Rather he attempts to show that parts of arithmetic, at least, can be seen as grounded in non-mathematical uses of language. Frege by contrast, whilst arguing that a proper account of arithmetic (and analysis) should show how its generality enables one to give a uniform account of multifarious different applications (cf. Dummett, 1991 Chapter 20) also argued strongly for the view that mathematical utterances have a meaning independent of, in conceptually prior to, their use in applications. Wittgenstein attempts no theory of mathematics in the Tractatus beyond arithmetic, a rather narrow fragment of arithmetic at that. The theory clearly shares the anti-platonism of the game formalist. There are no numbers, arithmetic is to be construed as a calculus in which one manipulates exponents or indices of operators. What is an operator? Wittgenstein distinguishes operator terms from function terms but commentators have struggled to explain what the distinction comes to. It is clear that Wittgenstein held that two occurrences of a function term \(f\) applied to different strings \(t\) and \(u\) have different meanings, where by ‘meaning’ Wittgenstein means referent, something like Frege’s Bedeutung. Thus ‘\(f\)’ in “\(f(t)\)” does not refer to the same entity as the outermost \(f\) in “\(f(f(t)\)”; this is supposed to be the basis of the solution to Russell’s paradox (¶3.333). In particular ‘the father of’ in “the father of John”, means something different there compared to its outermost occurrence in “the father of the father of John”. There can be no genuine iterated application of functions in other words, a cure for Russell’s paradox that many will find about as bad as the disease. Operators, however, are to be distinguished from functions in at least that aspect: genuine iteration of operators—the sentential operators of propositional logic are a prime example—is possible without supposing a change of sense or reference from one token to the other. What is their meaning or referent then? Wittgenstein denies they have any referents, this is a generalisation of his claim that the logical constants are not representatives. Peter Hylton (1997: 96–98) argues that Wittgenstein in the Tractatus has Russellian propositional functions in mind when he talks of ‘functions’ and is at pains to distinguish operators from these “substantial” entities. Russellian propositional functions are not the same as ordinary mathematical functions, the model for Frege’s notion of function. Rather they are structured entities, structurally related to the propositions which are their values— gappy states of affairs might be one way to think of them. Operators, by contrast, do not stand for any such entity, they are not parts nor any sort of ingredients of propositions, they “leave no trace” in them. Sentential operators are conceived as mapping not signs, nor inscriptions, to other signs and ascriptions but rather propositions, (in Wittgenstein’s rather course-grained sense of the term) to propositions. On Wittgenstein’s account of proposition, repeated application of an operation such as negation \(\ldots p, {\sim}p, {\sim}{\sim}p\ldots\) may take one back to an earlier point. Nonetheless Wittgenstein attempts to explicate arithmetic in terms of sentential operators applied to non-mathematical language. (One can see intimations here of Church’s later rigorous working out of a similar idea in his treatment of numbers in the lambda calculus as functions which repeatedly apply input functions.) In slogan form, numbers are exponents of operations (ibid., ¶6.021). Thus where \(\Omega\) is schematic for an operator and \(\Omega p\) (or \(\Omega(p))\) for its application to a proposition, then we can view the series as the starting point for a ‘definition’ of numbers, to be had by rewriting it as Here, then, we have infinitely many schematic rewrite rules. Indices such as ‘\(^{0+1+1+1+1}\)’ can be abbreviated by numerals in the obvious fashion, with ‘\(^{0+1+1+1+1}\)’ being abbreviated ‘4’ and so on. Wittgenstein’s examples show (though he did not explicitly state this) that addition of two number/exponents \(\Omega^{n}p + \Omega^{m}p\) (likewise \(\Omega^{n+m}p)\) is given by the rule: telling us we may replace the expression on the left in a formula by the one on the right. This is what underlies the ‘correctness’ of identities such \(n + m = r\) except that for Wittgenstein no such identity expresses a truth. On his account, the identity sign disappears in a full analysis of language, wherein sameness and distinction are shown by sameness and distinctness of names, no two of which refer, in fully analysed language, to the same object (this view gives grounds for interpreting mathematical utterances in the Tractatus as unsinnig). Wittgenstein himself did not trouble to show that abandonment of an identity sign would not cripple the expressive power of language but others such as Hintikka (1956) and Wehmeier (2004) have done so. What is left in the underlying language, with identity excised, are substitution rules (Tractatus ¶ 6.23). These have to be interpreted in a general, and schematic, fashion. Thus when we plug in \({\sim}\) for \(\Omega\), we find that (Wittgenstein had no intuitionist scruples here) a double application \({\sim}{\sim}p\) takes us back to (has the same sense as) \(p\). But this does not ground the truth of \(2 = 0\), since for many other operations \(\Omega \Omega p\) is not equivalent to \(p\). On the other hand Wittgenstein implicitly assumes suitable rules for the interaction of brackets with operators, in particular, generalised associativity. (In fact, he uses a mix of brackets and the notation \(\Omega 'p\) to express \(\Omega(p)\).) Since an equation \(\Omega^{n}p=\Omega^{m}p\) is, in its underlying logical form, not a universal generalisation \(\forall n,m(\Omega^{n}p = \Omega^{m}p)\) but a purely schematic generalisation, there is no form \(\exists n,m(\Omega^{n}p \ne \Omega^{m}p)\) with which we can express inequality, even if we can make sense of ‘\(\ne\)’. Nor can we express the inequality \(n \ne m\) schematically as the holding of the inequivalence of \(\Omega^n p\) from \(\Omega^m p\) for every choice for \(\Omega\).  Otherwise \(2 \ne 0\) would fail since \({\sim}{\sim}p\) is equivalent to \(p\). The Tractarian theory cannot handle inequalities. So much for addition and the limitations of its account of that operation. What of multiplication? Wittgenstein does define it, at ¶6.241, by: but to grasp this as a general principle we need to know how to interpret the notation \((\Omega^n)^m\). In more conventional mathematics, one might simply define \((x^n)^m\) as \(x^{n\times m}\) but clearly this (or rather the equivalent for the interaction of exponents of operators) would introduce a circularity into Wittgenstein’s account. Alternatively one could appeal to a recursive theory of exponents – \(a^{m\times 0}= a, a^{m\times(n+1)} = a^m + a^{m\times n}\). Since the principle of induction needed to show that the recursion is coherent features nowhere in Wittgenstein’s system, these rules would presumably have to be taken as primitive. Overall, then, Wittgenstein in the Tractatus gives us no account of mathematics in general other than for a fragment of arithmetic, basically positive identities involving only addition. And there he denies that the sentences express propositions with truth values. Of course the book was written under extraordinarily difficult circumstances. Perhaps his account could have been developed further and more plausibly, despite the difficulties noticed above—but for some scepticism on that front, see Landini, 2007. Certainly Wittgenstein made no attempt to do so whilst engaged with F.P. Ramsey and the Vienna Circle in the 1920s. If Wittgenstein’s standpoint was not capable of much further development, we have the choice of either abandoning all of mathematics except, at most, a fragment of the arithmetic of addition; or else of rejecting the Tractarian account. One does not need to be slavishly uncritical of contemporary mathematics to see what the reasonable option is here. Admittedly, rejecting the Tractatus account is also the option Wittgenstein himself seems to adopt at the end of the book; here then we enter the issue of what the point is of taking us through such a bizarre and unconvincing theory in order to throw it away at the end. (For a more positive appraisal of Wittgenstein’s Tractarian position, see Floyd (2002). Wittgenstein’s later work on philosophy of mathematics, such as the Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics 1956/1978), for a long time attracted even less approval than the Tractarian account, though recently philosophers such as Juliet Floyd and Hilary Putnam have come to its defence as an interesting and informed account of mathematics (Floyd/Putnam, 2000). Its themes include the rejection of the actual infinite (indeed the tendency in his writings is strongly finitist); the denial that undecidable sentences are meaningful; a rejection of Cantor’s powerset proof; the idea that proof discovery changes the very meaning of the terms involved; and other very radical ideas. Among them we find a continued adherence to formalist motifs: Another persistent theme in Wittgenstein’s thought is that the meaning of mathematics resides entirely in its utility in non-mathematical applications. But there is no systematic theory of how this applicability comes about, no proof of a conservative extension theorem, for example, showing how application of mathematical calculi to empirical premisses will never lead us to derive an empirical conclusion which does not follow from those premisses. And there is no resolution of the problem of the metatheory. On the other hand, we should observe that these notes of Wittgenstein on the philosophy of mathematics were not published by him, but by others after his death.
