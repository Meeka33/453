 In the 1970s, Harvey Friedman initiated a research programme of reverse mathematics, aiming to classify mathematical theorems according to their equivalence to one of a small number of set-theoretic principles (Friedman 1975). This classification reveals interesting, sometimes remarkable, differences in proof-theoretic complexity. For example, although the Ascoli-Arzelà theorem is used in the standard proof of Peano’s existence theorem for solutions of ordinary differential equations (Hurewicz [1958], page 10), a reverse-mathematical analysis shows that the former is equivalent to a strictly stronger set-theoretic principle than the one equivalent to Peano’s theorem (Simpson [1984], Theorems 3.9 and 4.2). The standard treatise on classical reverse mathematics is (Simpson [1999/2009]). Around the turn of this century, Veldman (see Other Internet Resources), in the Netherlands, and Ishihara [2005, 2006], in Japan, independently initiated a programme of constructive reverse mathematics (CRM), based on intuitionistic, rather than classical, logic. (Note, though, that the first published work in the modern era of CRM is probably that of Julian and Richman [1984], which was twenty years ahead of its time.) In this section of the article, we describe a less formal approach to CRM, in the style and framework of BISH. The aim of that CRM program is to classify the theorems in the three standard models—CLASS, INT, and RUSS—according to which principles we must, and need only, add to BISH in order to prove them. We stress that we restrict ourselves here to informal CRM, in which we take for granted the principles of function- and set-construction described in the first chapters of Bishop [1967] or Bishop & Bridges [1985], and we work in the informal, though rigorous, style of the practising analyst, algebraist, topologist, … . In practice, CRM splits naturally into two parts. In the first of these, we consider a theorem \(T\) of INT or RUSS, and try to find some principle, valid in that model and other than \(T\) itself, whose addition to BISH is necessary and sufficient for a constructive proof of \(T\). In the second part of CRM we deal with a theorem \(T\) of CLASS that we suspect is nonconstructive, and we try to prove that \(T\) is equivalent, over BISH, to one of a number of known essentially-nonconstructive principles, such as MP, LLPO, LPO, or LEM. For an example of this part of CRM, we mention our earlier proof that the classical least-upper-bound principle implies, and hence is equivalent to, LEM. Incidentally, there is a strong argument for Brouwer [1921] being the first to deal with reverse-mathematical ideas: his Brouwerian counterexamples (see the one using the Goldbach conjecture, in Section 1 above) lie squarely in the second part of CRM. Even if Brouwer did not state those examples as logical equivalences, but as implications of the type it is hard to believe that he was unaware that the right-hand-side implied the left in such cases. To illustrate the first part of CRM, we now concentrate on theorems of the type where FT\(_?\) is some form of Brouwer’s fan theorem, and \(T\) is a theorem of INT. To do so, we need to distinguish between certain types of bar for the complete binary fan \(2^*\) (the set of all finite sequences in \(\{0,1\})\). Let \(\alpha \equiv (\alpha_1 ,\alpha_2, \ldots)\) be a finite or infinite binary sequence. The concatenation of \(\alpha\) with another string \(\beta\) is For \(b\) in \(\{0,1\}\) we write \(\alpha^{\frown}b\) rather than \(\alpha^{\frown}(b)\).  By a \(\mathsf{c}\)-subset of \(2^*\) we mean a subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) such that for some detachable subset \(D\) of \(2^*\). Every detachable subset of \(2^*\) is a \(\mathsf{c}\)-subset. On the other hand, by a \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-subset of \(2^*\) we mean a subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) with the following property: there exists a detachable subset \(S\) of \(2^* \times \bN\) such that and Every \(\mathsf{c}\)-subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) is a \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-subset: simply take \(S = D \times \bN\), where \(D\) is a detachable subset of \(2^*\) such that (1) holds. If \(?\) denotes a property of subsets of \(2^*\), then Brouwer’s fan theorem for \(?\)-bars tells us that every bar with the property \(?\) is a uniform bar. We are particularly interested in the fan theorem for detachable bars (already discussed in Section 3.1): FT\(_D\): Every detachable bar of the complete binary fan is uniform; the fan theorem for \(\mathsf{c}\)-bars (that is, bars that are \(\mathsf{c}\)-subsets): FT\(_{\mathsf{c}}\): Every c-bar of the complete binary fan is uniform; the fan theorem for \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-bars (that is, bars that are \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-subsets): FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1}\): Every \(\Pi^{0}_1\)-bar of the complete binary fan is uniform; and the full fan theorem: FT: Every bar of the complete binary fan is uniform. Note that, relative to BISH, FT \(\Rightarrow\) FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1} \Rightarrow\) FT\(_c \Rightarrow\) FT\(_D\). Lubarsky and Diener [2014] have shown that these implications are strict. Typically, we want to prove that FT\(_?\) is equivalent, over BISH, to the proposition that, for every set \(S\) of an appropriate sort, some pointwise property of the form actually holds uniformly in the form Our strategy for attacking this problem is two-fold. First, given a set \(S\) of the appropriate sort, we construct a ?-subset \(N\) of \(2^*\) such that This, though, is only half of the solution. To prove that the implication from (3) to (2) implies FT\(_?\), we consider a ?-subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) and construct a corresponding set \(S\) such that The canonical example of such results is that of Julian and Richman [1984], in which \(S\) is the set of values of a given uniformly continuous mapping \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR, T\) is the set of positive real numbers, and The pointwise property we consider is its uniform version being The Julian-Richman results are as follows. Theorem 1:  Let \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR\) be uniformly continuous. Then there exists a detachable subset \(B\) of \(2^*\) such that Theorem 2:  Let \(B\) be a detachable subset of \(2^*\). Then there exists a uniformly continuous \(f : [0,1] \rightarrow \bR\) such that The proofs of these two theorems are subtle and tricky; see Julian & Richman [1984]. The two Julian-Richman theorems together reveal that, relative to BISH, the fan theorem FT\(_D\) is equivalent to the positivity principle, POS: Each positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \([0,1]\) has a positive infimum. It follows that POS is derivable in INT, in which the full fan theorem, not just FT\(_D\), is a standard principle. The situation is quiet the opposite in RUSS, where there exist both a detachable bar of \(2^*\) that is not uniform and a positive-valued, uniformly continuous function on \([0,1]\) that has infimum equal to 0; see Chapters 5 and 6 of Bridges & Richman [1987]. Berger and Ishihara [2005] have taken a different, indirect route to establishing the equivalence of POS and FT\(_c\). They establish a chain of equivalences between POS, FT\(_c\), and four principles of the type “if there is at most one object with property \(P\), then there is one such object”. The four unique-existence principles are: CIN!:   Each descending sequence of inhabited closed located subsets of a compact metric space with at most one common point has inhabited intersection (Cantor’s intersection theorem with uniqueness.) Note that a subset \(S\) of a metric space \((X,\rho)\) is located if for each \(x\) in \(X\) the infimum distance from \(x\) to \(S\) exists. MIN!:   Each uniformly continuous, real-valued function on a compact metric space with at most one minimum point has a minimum point. WKL!  Each infinite tree with at most one infinite branch has an infinite branch (the weak König lemma with uniqueness). FIX!:   Each uniformly continuous function from a compact metric space into itself with at most one fixed point and with approximate fixed points has a fixed point. In, for example, the last of these, we say that a map \(f\) of a metric space \((X,\varrho)\) into itself A major open problem in CRM is that of finding a form of the fan theorem that is equivalent, over BISH, to the uniform continuity theorem for \([0,1]\), UCT\(_{[0,1]}\): Every pointwise continuous mapping of \([0,1]\) into \(\bR\) is uniformly continuous, the proposition for which Brouwer originally developed his proof of the fan theorem. (Note that UCT\(_{[0,1]}\) is equivalent, relative to BISH, to the general uniform continuity theorem for metric spaces: Every pointwise continuous mapping of a complete, totally bounded metric space into a metric space is uniformly continuous. See, for example, Loeb [2005].) It follows from results of Berger [2006] that BISH \(\vdash\) UCT\(_{[0,1]}\Rightarrow\) FT\(_c\). Also, Diener and Loeb (2008) have proved that BISH \(\vdash\) FT\(_{\Pi^{0}_1} \Rightarrow\) UCT\(_{[0,1]}\). However, we do not know if either of these implications can be replaced by a bi-implication. Perhaps UCT\(_{[0,1]}\), and hence the full uniform continuity theorem for compact metric spaces, is equivalent, relative to BISH, to some natural, but as yet unidentified, version of the fan theorem. For additional material on the fan theorem in constructive reverse mathematics, see, for example, Berger & Bridges [2007]; Diener [2008, 2012]; Diener & Loeb [2009]; and Diener & Lubarsky [2014]. In Dent [2013], there is a clear, though complex, diagram illustrating the interconnections between fan theorems, continuity, and omniscience principles (see Other Internet Resources).
