 Every mathematical object may be viewed as a set. For example, the natural numbers are identified with the finite ordinals, so \(\mathbb{N}=\omega\). The set of integers \(\mathbb{Z}\) may be defined as the set of equivalence classes of pairs of natural numbers under the equivalence relation \((n, m)\equiv (n',m')\) if and only if \(n+m'=m+n'\). By identifying every natural number \(n\) with the equivalence class of the pair \((n,0)\), one may extend naturally the operations of sum and product of natural numbers to \(\mathbb{Z}\) (see Enderton (1977) for details, and Levy (1979) for a different construction). Further, one may define the rationals \(\mathbb{Q}\) as the set of equivalence classes of pairs \((n,m)\) of integers, where \(m\ne 0\), under the equivalence relation \((n,m)\equiv (n',m')\) if and only if \(n\cdot m'=m\cdot n'\). Again, the operations \(+\) and \(\cdot\) on \(\mathbb{Z}\) may be extended naturally to \(\mathbb{Q}\). Moreover, the ordering \(\leq_{\mathbb{Q}}\) on the rationals is given by: \(r \leq_{\mathbb{Q}} s\) if and only if there exists \(t\in \mathbb{Q}\) such that \(s=r+t\). The real numbers may be defined as Dedekind cuts of \(\mathbb{Q}\), namely, a real number is given by a pair \((A,B)\) of non-empty disjoint sets such that \(A\cup B=\mathbb{Q}\), and \(a\leq_{\mathbb{Q}}b\) for every \(a\in A\) and \(b\in B\). One can then extend again the operations of \(+\) and \(\cdot\) on \(\mathbb{Q}\), as well as the ordering \(\leq_{\mathbb{Q}}\), to the set of real numbers \(\mathbb{R}\). Let us emphasize that it is not claimed that, e.g., real numbers are Dedekind cuts of rationals, as they could also be defined using Cauchy sequences, or in other different ways. What is important, from a foundational point of view, is that the set-theoretic version of \(\mathbb{R}\), together with the usual algebraic operations, satisfies the categorical axioms that the real numbers satisfy, namely those of a complete ordered field. The metaphysical question of what the real numbers really are is irrelevant here. Algebraic structures can also be viewed as sets, as any \(n\)-ary relation on the elements of a set \(A\) can be viewed as a set of \(n\)-tuples \((a_1,\ldots ,a_n)\) of elements of \(A\). And any \(n\)-ary function \(f\) on \(A\), with values on some set \(B\), can be seen as the set of \(n+1\)-tuples \(((a_1,\ldots ,a_n),b)\) such that \(b\) is the value of \(f\) on \((a_1,\ldots ,a_m)\). Thus, for example, a group is just a triple \((A, +, 0)\), where \(A\) is a non-empty set, \(+\) is a binary function on \(A\) that is associative, \(0\) is an element of \(A\) such that \(a+0=0+a=a\), for all \(a\in A\), and for every \(a\in A\) there is an element of \(A\), denoted by \(-a\), such that \(a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0\). Also, a topological space is just a set \(X\) together with a topology \(\tau\) on it, i.e., \(\tau\) is a subset of \(\mathcal{P}(X)\) containing \(X\) and \({\varnothing}\), and closed under arbitrary unions and finite intersections. Any mathematical object whatsoever can always be viewed as a set, or a proper class. The properties of the object can then be expressed in the language of set theory. Any mathematical statement can be formalized into the language of set theory, and any mathematical theorem can be derived, using the calculus of first-order logic, from the axioms of ZFC, or from some extension of ZFC. It is in this sense that set theory provides a foundation for mathematics. The foundational role of set theory for mathematics, while significant, is by no means the only justification for its study. The ideas and techniques developed within set theory, such as infinite combinatorics, forcing, or the theory of large cardinals, have turned it into a deep and fascinating mathematical theory, worthy of study by itself, and with important applications to practically all areas of mathematics. The remarkable fact that virtually all of mathematics can be formalized within ZFC, makes possible a mathematical study of mathematics itself. Thus, any questions about the existence of some mathematical object, or the provability of a conjecture or hypothesis can be given a mathematically precise formulation. This makes metamathematics possible, namely the mathematical study of mathematics itself. So, the question about the provability or unprovability of any given mathematical statement becomes a sensible mathematical question. When faced with an open mathematical problem or conjecture, it makes sense to ask for its provability or unprovability in the ZFC formal system. Unfortunately, the answer may be neither, because ZFC, if consistent, is incomplete. Gödel’s completeness theorem for first-order logic implies that ZFC is consistent—i.e., no contradiction can be derived from it—if and only if it has a model. A model of ZFC is a pair \((M,E)\), where \(M\) is a non-empty set and \(E\) is a binary relation on \(M\) such that all the axioms of ZFC are true when interpreted in \((M,E)\), i.e., when the variables that appear in the axioms range over elements of \(M\), and \(\in\) is interpreted as \(E\). Thus, if \(\varphi\) is a sentence of the language of set theory and one can find a model of ZFC in which \(\varphi\) holds, then its negation \(\neg \varphi\) cannot be proved in ZFC. Hence, if one can find a model of \(\varphi\) and also a model of \(\neg \varphi\), then \(\varphi\) is neither provable nor disprovable in ZFC, in which case we say that \(\varphi\) is undecidable in, or independent of, ZFC. In 1931, Gödel announced his striking incompleteness theorems, which assert that any reasonable formal system for mathematics is necessarily incomplete. In particular, if ZFC is consistent, then there are undecidable propositions in ZFC. Moreover, Gödel’s second incompleteness theorem implies that the formal (arithmetical) statement \(CON(ZFC)\), which asserts that ZFC is consistent, while true, cannot be proved in ZFC. And neither can its negation. Thus, \(CON(ZFC)\) is undecidable in ZFC. If ZFC is consistent, then it cannot prove the existence of a model of ZFC, for otherwise ZFC would prove its own consistency. Thus, a proof of consistency or of undecidability of a given sentence \(\varphi\) is always a relative consistency proof. That is, one assumes that ZFC is consistent, hence it has a model, and then one constructs another model of ZFC where the sentence \(\varphi\) is true. We shall see several examples in the next sections.
