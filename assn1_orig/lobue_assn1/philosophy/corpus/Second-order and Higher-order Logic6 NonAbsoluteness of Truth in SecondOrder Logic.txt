 Absoluteness is one of the most important concepts of logic. It was used already in 1939 by Gödel in his analysis of the hierarchy of constructible sets (1939 [1990: 46]) towards proving the consistency of the Continuum Hypothesis. It is briefly mentioned by Gödel three years earlier in connection with the notion of computability (1936 [1986: 397]). Intuitively speaking, a concept is absolute if its meaning is independent of the formalism used, or in other words, if its meaning in the formal sense is the same as its meaning in the “real world”. This may sound very vague and inexact. However, absoluteness has a perfectly exact technical definition in set theory. Recall that a set a is called transitive if every element of an element of a is an element of a. A transitive model is a model \((M,\in)\) such that M is transitive. By the Mostowski Collapsing Lemma (Mostowski 1949) every well-founded model \((M,E)\) of the Axiom of Extensionality is isomorphic to a transitive model. A basic property of transitive models \((M,\in)\) is that if \(a,b\in M\), then \(M\models a\subseteq b\) if and only if \(a\subseteq b\). (If all elements of a that are in M are in b then all elements of a are in b, as by transitivity of M, elements of a are necessarily elements of M.) We could express this by saying that the formula \(x\subseteq y\) is absolute in transitive models. More generally, we say that a formula \(\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) of the first order language of set theory is absolute relative to ZFC if there is a finite \(T\subseteq \ZFC\) such that for all transitive models \((M,\in)\) of T and all \(a_1,\ldots,a_n\in M\) we have This definition of absoluteness is equivalent to the following more syntactic condition (Feferman & Kreisel 1966): there are a \(\Sigma_1\)-formula \(\exists y\,\psi(y,x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) and a \(\Pi_1\)-formula \(\forall y\,\theta(y,x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) such that and In such a case we say that \(\phi(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\) is \(\Delta_1^{\text{ZFC}}\). For first order logic it can be proved that “\(\mm\models_s\phi\)” is an absolute property of \(\mm\), s and \(\phi\) relative to ZFC. In fact, this is true even if ZFC is replaced by the weaker Kripke-Platek set theory KP (see Barwise 1972a). The usual Tarski Truth Definition of first order logic can be written in \(\Delta_1^{\text{ZFC}}\) form. For second-order logic the propositions “\(\phi\) is a second-order formula”, “\(\mm\) is an L-structure” and “s is an assignment” are all absolute relative to ZFC as well, but “\(\mm\models_s\phi\)” is not, as we shall now see. This is a crucial property of second-order logic. One may consider it a weakness, if one thinks of absoluteness as a desirable property, or a strength, if one takes non-absoluteness as a sign of expressive power. Whether a weakness or not, it is an important feature of second-order logic and a dominating topic in discussions about it. Second-order logic is, however, not the only non-absolute logic. For example, \(L(Q_1)\) (see the entry on  generalized quantifiers)  and \(L_{\omega_1\omega_1}\) (see then entry on  infinitary languages)  are non-absolute, while \(L(Q_0)\) and \(L_{\omega_1\omega}\) are absolute. The reason why \(L(Q_0)\) is absolute is essentially that the property of a set being infinite is absolute in transitive models of ZFC. Although the set of sentences of \(L_{\omega_1\omega}\) may vary from one transitive model of ZFC to another, the truth of a sentence of \(L_{\omega_1\omega}\) in a model is absolute in transitive models of ZFC essentially because the truth has a simple inductive definition which only refers to subformulas of the sentence and elements of the model. Recall the definition of the sentence \(\theta_{\textrm{EC}}(P,R)\) in  §5.3,  which says that the interpretations of the predicates P and R have the same cardinality. Cardinality is not an absolute property. Two sets (even two ordinals) can be of different cardinality in one transitive model of ZFC and of the same cardinality in a transitive extension. It is easy to see that “\(\mm\models_s\theta_{\textrm{EC}}(P,R)\)” is not absolute relative to ZFC. Essentially, the reason is that two sets have the same cardinality if there is a bijection between them. In a small transitive set it may happen that the sets are there but the bijection manifesting their equicardinality is not. The bijection may be one obtained by the method of forcing. Or the lack of the bijection may be the result of applying the Downward Löwenheim-Skolem  Theorem[6]. A more serious case of non-absoluteness is the sentence \(\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\) of  §5.3.  The sentence \(\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\) of the empty vocabulary has a model if and only if the Continuum Hypothesis is true. If \(T\subseteq \ZFC\) is finite, then there are countable transitive models \(M\subseteq M'\) such that one, say M, satisfies CH and the other, in this case \(M'\), does not (by Cohen 1966). In M the sentence \(\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\) has a model \(\ma\), that is, \(M\models \textrm{“}\ma\models\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\textrm{”}\). In \(M'\) the same sentence has no models, in particular \(M'\not\models \textrm{“}\ma\models\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\textrm{”}\). Thus the property of a model satisfying a second-order sentence is not absolute relative to ZFC. Even the property of a second-order sentence having a model is not absolute relative to ZFC, because in M the sentence \(\theta_{\textrm{CH}}\) has a model but in \(M'\) not. For first order logic the property of a sentence of having a model is co-re and therefore arithmetical. Arithmetical properties are always absolute relative to ZFC. The situation is similar if the Continuum Hypothesis is replaced by the Axiom of Choice (see  §5.4). The CH and the AC are central questions of set theory and subjects of continuing debate. While the AC is mostly accepted as an axiom, and is part of the ZFC axiom system, the CH is widely considered an open problem. There are even suggestions (e.g., Feferman 1999) that it cannot be solved by any axiom system with the kind of general acceptance that ZFC has. The formalist position in the foundations of mathematics goes further and maintains that the question, what the truth value of CH is, is meaningless. Both CH and its negation are consistent with ZFC, assuming ZFC itself is consistent. According to the formalist position the status of CH has been solved with this. The semantics of second-order logic depending on these hard questions of set theory puts second-order logic into the same “basket” with set theory. Criticism of set theory becomes criticism of second-order logic and vice versa. Another indication of the dependence of second-order logic on set theory as the metatheory is the result of Barwise to the effect that the existence of the Hanf number of second-order logic is not provable in set theory without a highly complex use of the Replacement Axiom (for details, see Barwise 1972b).
