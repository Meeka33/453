 In the late 1920s Alfred Tarski embarked on a project to give rigorous definitions for notions useful in scientific methodology. In 1933 he published (in Polish) his analysis of the notion of a true sentence. This long paper undertook two tasks: first to say what should count as a satisfactory definition of ‘true sentence’ for a given formal language, and second to show that there do exist satisfactory definitions of ‘true sentence’ for a range of formal languages. We begin with the first task; Section 2 will consider the second. We say that a language is fully interpreted if all its sentences have meanings that make them either true or false. All the languages that Tarski considered in the 1933 paper were fully interpreted, with one exception described in Section 2.2 below. This was the main difference between the 1933 definition and the later model-theoretic definition of 1956, which we shall examine in Section 3. Tarski described several conditions that a satisfactory definition of truth should meet. If the language under discussion (the object language) is \(L\), then the definition should be given in another language known as the metalanguage, call it \(M\). The metalanguage should contain a copy of the object language (so that anything one can say in \(L\) can be said in \(M\) too), and \(M\) should also be able to talk about the sentences of \(L\) and their syntax. Finally Tarski allowed \(M\) to contain notions from set theory, and a 1-ary predicate symbol True with the intended reading ‘is a true sentence of \(L\)’. The main purpose of the metalanguage was to formalise what was being said about the object language, and so Tarski also required that the metalanguage should carry with it a set of axioms expressing everything that one needs to assume for purposes of defining and justifying the truth definition. The truth definition itself was to be a definition of True in terms of the other expressions of the metalanguage. So the definition was to be in terms of syntax, set theory and the notions expressible in \(L\), but not semantic notions like ‘denote’ or ‘mean’ (unless the object language happened to contain these notions). Tarski assumed, in the manner of his time, that the object language \(L\) and the metalanguage \(M\) would be languages of some kind of higher order logic. Today it is more usual to take some kind of informal set theory as one’s metalanguage; this would affect a few details of Tarski’s paper but not its main thrust. Also today it is usual to define syntax in set-theoretic terms, so that for example a string of letters becomes a sequence. In fact one must use a set-theoretic syntax if one wants to work with an object language that has uncountably many symbols, as model theorists have done freely for over half a century now. The definition of True should be ‘formally correct’. This means that it should be a sentence of the form For all \(x\), True\((x)\) if and only if \(\phi(x)\), where True never occurs in \(\phi\); or failing this, that the definition should be provably equivalent to a sentence of this form. The equivalence must be provable using axioms of the metalanguage that don’t contain True. Definitions of the kind displayed above are usually called explicit, though Tarski in 1933 called them normal. The definition should be ‘materially adequate’ (trafny – a better translation would be ‘accurate’). This means that the objects satisfying \(\phi\) should be exactly the objects that we would intuitively count as being true sentences of \(L\), and that this fact should be provable from the axioms of the metalanguage. At first sight this is a paradoxical requirement: if we can prove what Tarski asks for, just from the axioms of the metalanguage, then we must already have a materially adequate formalisation of ‘true sentence of \(L\)’ within the metalanguage, suggesting an infinite regress. In fact Tarski escapes the paradox by using (in general) infinitely many sentences of \(M\) to express truth, namely all the sentences of the form whenever \(s\) is the name of a sentence \(S\) of \(L\) and \(\psi\) is the copy of \(S\) in the metalanguage. So the technical problem is to find a single formula \(\phi\) that allows us to deduce all these sentences from the axioms of \(M\); this formula \(\phi\) will serve to give the explicit definition of True. Tarski’s own name for this criterion of material adequacy was Convention T. More generally his name for his approach to defining truth, using this criterion, was the semantic conception of truth. As Tarski himself emphasised, Convention \(T\) rapidly leads to the liar paradox if the language \(L\) has enough resources to talk about its own semantics. (See the entry on  the revision theory of truth.)  Tarski’s own conclusion was that a truth definition for a language \(L\) has to be given in a metalanguage which is essentially stronger than \(L\). There is a consequence for the foundations of mathematics. First-order Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory is widely regarded as the standard of mathematical correctness, in the sense that a proof is correct if and only if it can be formalised as a formal proof in set theory. We would like to be able to give a truth definition for set theory; but by Tarski’s result this truth definition can’t be given in set theory itself. The usual solution is to give the truth definition informally in English. But there are a number of ways of giving limited formal truth definitions for set theory. For example Azriel Levy showed that for every natural number \(n\) there is a \(\Sigma_n\) formula that is satisfied by all and only the set-theoretic names of true \(\Sigma_n\) sentences of set theory. The definition of \(\Sigma_n\) is too technical to give here, but three points are worth making. First, every sentence of set theory is provably equivalent to a \(\Sigma_n\) sentence for any large enough \(n\). Second, the class of \(\Sigma_n\) formulas is closed under adding existential quantifiers at the beginning, but not under adding universal quantifiers. Third, the class is not closed under negation; this is how Levy escapes Tarski’s paradox. (See the entry on  set theory.)  Essentially the same devices allow Jaakko Hintikka to give an internal truth definition for his  independence friendly logic;  this logic shares the second and third properties of Levy’s classes of formulas.
