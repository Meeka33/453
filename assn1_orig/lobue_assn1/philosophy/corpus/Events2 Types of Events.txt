 Philosophers who agree with a conception of events as particulars typically distinguish different sorts of such particulars. A classic typology distinguishes four sorts: activities, accomplishments, achievements, and states (Ryle 1949; Vendler 1957). An activity, such as John’s walking uphill, is a homogeneous event: its sub-events satisfy the same description as the activity itself, which has no natural finishing point or culmination. An accomplishment, such as John’s climbing the mountain, may have a culmination, but is never homogeneous. An achievement, such as John’s reaching the top, is a culminating event (and is therefore always instantaneous). And a state, such as John’s knowing the shortest way, is homogeneous and may extend over time, but it makes no sense to ask how long it took or whether it culminated. Sometimes accomplishments and achievements are grouped together into a single category of performances (Kenny 1963). Sometimes achievements have also been called events tout court and all other events have been grouped together into a broadly understood category of temporally extended entities, called processes (Ingarden 1935); the word ‘eventuality’ may then be used as a label covering both categories (Bach 1986). Some authors introduce aspectual considerations into the taxonomy, drawing on Aristotle’s distinction between Energeia and Kinêsis (Ackrill 1965). The idea is that different verbs describe different types of events: verbs with no continuous form (‘know’) correspond to states; verbs with continuous form for which the present continuous entails the past perfect (‘John is walking uphill’ entails ‘John walked uphill’) correspond to activities; and verbs for which the present continuous entails the negation of the past perfect (‘John is climbing the mountain’ entails ‘John has not (yet) climbed the mountain’, at least in the relevant context) correspond to performances (Mourelatos 1978). Several authors have followed in these footsteps to develop linguistically sophisticated theories (Taylor 1977; Dowty 1979; Freed 1979; Roberts 1979; Bach 1981; Galton 1984; Verkuyl 1989; Smith 1991; Kühl 2008), but the legitimacy of drawing ontological categorizations from such linguistic distinctions has been questioned (Gill 1993). One may also want to distinguish between dynamic events, such as John’s walking, and static events, such as John’s resting under a tree. According to some authors, the latter are not events proper because they do not involve any change (Ducasse 1926). In the most abstract construal, a change is an ordered pair of states of affairs: an initial state and an end state (von Wright 1963). More substantial accounts of events as changes describe them as exemplifications of dynamic properties, i.e., properties that an object has by virtue of a “movement” in some quality space (Quinton 1979; Lombard 1979, 1986). However, the question of whether all events should be or involve changes of some sort is controversial (Montmarquet 1980; Steward 1997; Mellor 1998; Simons 2003) and it may be argued that it is ultimately a matter of stipulation—hence of little metaphysical import (Casati & Varzi 2008). If static events are admitted, the question arises of whether they should be kept distinct from states (Parsons 1989). One plausible assumption is that the distinction between the static and the dynamic aspects of the world is skew to the distinction between states and activities. As there may be static activities, so there may be dynamic states. Walking is a state of John’s that is dynamic, as opposed to his state of resting, which is static. The walk itself is an activity of John’s that is dynamic, as opposed to the rest he took under a tree, which may be considered a static activity. Prima facie, actions are naturally categorized as a subclass of events, namely, animate events. Like all events, actions are said to occur or take place, not to exist, and their relation to time and space is event-like as well: they have relatively clear beginnings and endings but unclear spatial boundaries, they appear to tolerate co-location, and they cannot be said to move from one place to another or to endure from one time to another, but rather extend in space and time by having spatial as well as temporal parts (Thomson 1977). Actions and events appear to be on a par in causal explanations, too: actions can be causes of which events are effects (Davidson 1967b). Some authors, however, prefer to draw a distinction here and to treat actions as relations between agents and events, namely as instances of the relation of ‘bringing about’ that may hold between an agent and an event (von Wright 1963; Chisholm 1964; Bach 1980; Bishop 1983; Segerberg 1989), or perhaps the relation ‘seeing to it that’ (Belnap and Perloff 1988; Tuomela and Sandu 1994; Horty 2001). On such views, actions are not individuals unless relations are themselves construed as tropes. Whether or not actions are treated as events, one might be tempted to distinguish between actions proper (such as John’s raising of his arm) and bodily movements (such as John’s arm rising), or between intentional actions (John’s walk) and unintentional ones (John’s falling into a hole). For some authors, this is necessary in order to explain important facts of human behavior (Montmarquet 1978; Hornsby 1980a,b; Searle 1983; Brand 1984; Mele 1997). However, it has also been argued that such distinctions do not pertain to metaphysics but rather to the conceptual apparatus by means of which we describe the realm of things that happen. On this view, an arm raising is just an arm’s rising under a mentalistic description (Anscombe 1957, 1979; Sher 1973). A similar story applies to the distinction between mental events (John’s decision to wear boots) and physical or physiological events (such and such neurons firing). One may think that this distinction is real insofar as the latter events are expected to fall naturally into the nomological net of physical theories whereas the former seem to escape it. But one may also want to resist this line of thought and maintain that the distinction between the mental and the physical concerns exclusively the vocabulary with which we describe what goes on. These options have important ramifications for various issues in the philosophy of mind—e.g., issues of mental causation (Heil & Mele 1993; Walter & Heckmann 2003; Gibb et al. 2013). If the distinction between mental and physical events is ontologically significant, then the question arises of how these two sorts of event causally interact with each other, leading to various forms of anomalous or nomological dualism (Foster 1991). By contrast, the claim that the distinction is purely semantic is congenial to a monist position, whether nomological or anomalous (Macdonald 1989). Anomalous monism has been popular especially among philosophers who accept a particularist conception of events as widely redescribable entities, for such a conception allows one to accept the materialist claim that all events are physical (regardless of whether one describes them in mentalistic terms) while rejecting the seeming consequence that mental goings-on can be given purely physical explanations (precisely because only a physicalistic vocabulary is suited to such explanations) (Nagel 1965; Davidson 1970, 1993). Some authors, however, have argued that this line of argument falls prey to the charge of epiphenomenalism, to the effect that mental events would lack causal or explanatory powers altogether (Honderich 1982; Robinson 1982; Kim 1993; Campbell 1998, 2005) and on such matters the debate is still open. Events are things that happen. In some cases, however, the same sort of prima facie evidence that suggests a realist attitude towards such things might suggest a similar attitude towards things that do not actually happen, including “negative actions” of various sorts (Danto 1966; Ryle 1973). We speak of John’s walk with the same easiness with which we speak of the talk he did not deliver, the nap he did not take, the party he failed to organize; we seem to quantify over such things, and we normally engage in causal talk that seems to refer explicitly to negative causes, as when we reason that John’s failure to turn off the gas caused an explosion, or that his omitting the cutlery from the wedding list made Mary angry. Some authors take such evidence at face value, drawing a distinction at the ontological level: a good inventory of the world ought to include “negative” events and actions along with ordinary, “positive” ones (Lee 1978; Vermazen 1985; De Swart 1996; Przepiórkowski 1999; Higginbotham 2000; Mossel 2009; Silver 2018; Bernard & Champollion 2018). Others dissent: we often speak as though there were such things, but deep down we want our words to be interpreted in such a way as to avoid ontological commitment. Thus, either we are just engaging in mere counterfactual speculations, or else the putative negative events are just ordinary, positive events under a negative description: ‘John’s omitting the cutlery from the wedding list’, for example, would refer to his drawing up a wedding list that contains no cutlery, ‘Mary’s not moving’ would describe Mary’s working hard to master urges to move, etc. (Mele 2005; Varzi 2008). The latter view can also be construed in metaphysical (as opposed to semantic) terms, at least in some cases: for x to omit to φ (refrain from φ-ing, etc.) at t would be for x to ensure, through their actual behavior, that they do not φ at t (Payton 2018). The case of negative causation is especially challenging, not last because of the link between causation and such ethical and legal matters as passive killing (Bennett 1966; Green 1980; Foot 1984), good Samaritanism (Kleinig 1976) and, more generally, moral responsibility (Weinryb 1980; Walton 1980; Williams 1995; Fischer 1997; Clarke 2014). Here it is also customary to introduce finer-grained discriminations, distinguishing e.g. several ways in which an agent may fail to do something, e.g. (trying and) not succeeding, refraining, omitting, and allowing (Brand 1971; Milanich 1984; Hall 1984; Bach 2010). At least with regard to some such ways, it is very tempting to endorse a realist ontology. If so, the difficulty naturally arises of how and where to draw the line. For example, the realist about omissions will have to find a principled way of refraining from treating all omissions, including non-salient ones, as causes (Gorr 1979; Lewis 1986b, 2004; Thomson 2003; Menzies 2004; McGrath 2005; Sartorio 2009; Bernstein 2014). On the other hand, the antirealist will have to explain how one can account for such causal talk while holding on to the view that every causal situation develops from “positive factors alone” (Armstrong 1999). Some would insist that every alleged case of negative causation can be described in terms of positive causation (Laliberté 2013). Others—the majority—would resist ontological commitment by recasting the logical structure of the relevant causal claims in suitable ways, e.g. as causal statements about events that are counterfactually described (Hunt 2005), or as “quasi-causal” claims about what would have been a cause if the omitted event had happened (Dowe 2001), or as mere causal explanations in which the explanans does not stand to the explanandum as cause to effect (Beebee 2004; Varzi 2007; Lombard & Hudson, in press).
