<div id="preamble">

<p>

Considered by some to be the greatest philosopher of the 20th century,
Ludwig Wittgenstein played a central, if controversial, role in
20th-century analytic philosophy. He continues to influence current
philosophical thought in topics as diverse as logic and language,
perception and intention, ethics and religion, aesthetics and culture.
Originally, there were two commonly recognized stages of
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s thought&mdash;the early and the later&mdash;both
of which were taken to be pivotal in their respective periods. In more
recent scholarship, this division has been questioned: some
interpreters have claimed a unity between all stages of his thought,
while others talk of a more nuanced division, adding stages such as
the middle Wittgenstein and the third Wittgenstein. Still, it is
commonly acknowledged that the early Wittgenstein is epitomized in his
<em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>. By showing the application of
modern logic to metaphysics, via language, he provided new insights
into the relations between world, thought and language and thereby into
the nature of philosophy. It is the later Wittgenstein, mostly
recognized in the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, who took the
more revolutionary step in critiquing all of traditional philosophy
including its climax in his own early work. The nature of his new
philosophy is heralded as anti-systematic through and through, yet
still conducive to genuine philosophical understanding of traditional
problems.</p>

<h2 id="BiogSket">1. Biographical Sketch</h2>

<p>
Wittgenstein was born on April 26, 1889 in Vienna, Austria, to a
wealthy industrial family, well-situated in intellectual and cultural
Viennese circles. In 1908 he began his studies in aeronautical
engineering at Manchester University where his interest in the
philosophy of pure mathematics led him to Frege. Upon Frege&rsquo;s
advice, in 1911 he went to Cambridge to study with Bertrand
Russell. Russell wrote, upon meeting Wittgenstein: &ldquo;An unknown
German appeared &hellip; obstinate and perverse, but I think not
stupid&rdquo; (quoted by Monk 1990: 38f). Within one year, Russell was
committed: &ldquo;I shall certainly encourage him. Perhaps he will do
great things &hellip; I love him and feel he will solve the problems I
am too old to solve&rdquo; (quoted by Monk 1990: 41). Russell&rsquo;s
insight was accurate. Wittgenstein was idiosyncratic in his habits and
way of life, yet profoundly acute in his philosophical
sensitivity.</p>

<p>

During his years in Cambridge, from 1911 to 1913, Wittgenstein
conducted several conversations on philosophy and the foundations of
logic with Russell, with whom he had an emotional and intense
relationship, as well as with Moore and Keynes. He retreated to
isolation in Norway, for months at a time, in order to ponder these
philosophical problems and to work out their solutions. In 1913 he
returned to Austria and in 1914, at the start of World War I
(1914&ndash;1918), joined the Austrian army. He was taken captive in 1918
and spent the remaining months of the war at a prison camp. It was
during the war that he wrote the notes and drafts of his first
important work, <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em>. After the war
the book was published in German and translated into English.</p>

<p>

In 1920 Wittgenstein, now divorced from philosophy (having, to his
mind, solved all philosophical problems in the <em>Tractatus</em>),
gave away his part of his family&rsquo;s fortune and pursued several
&lsquo;professions&rsquo; (gardener, teacher, architect, etc.) in and
around Vienna. It was only in 1929 that he returned to Cambridge to
resume his philosophical vocation, after having been exposed to
discussions on the philosophy of mathematics and science with members
of the Vienna Circle, whose conception of logical empiricism was
indebted to his <em>Tractatus</em> account of logic as tautologous,
and his philosophy as concerned with logical syntax. During these
first years in Cambridge his conception of philosophy and its problems
underwent dramatic changes that are recorded in several volumes of
conversations, lecture notes, and letters (e.g., <em>Ludwig
Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle</em>, <em>The Blue and Brown
Books</em>, <em>Philosophical Grammar</em>).  Sometimes termed the
&lsquo;middle Wittgenstein&rsquo;, this period heralds a rejection of
dogmatic philosophy, including both traditional works and the
<em>Tractatus</em> itself.</p>

<p>

In the 1930s and 1940s Wittgenstein conducted seminars at
Cambridge, developing most of the ideas that he intended to publish in
his second book, <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>. These included
the turn from formal logic to ordinary language, novel reflections on
psychology and mathematics, and a general skepticism concerning
philosophy&rsquo;s pretensions. In 1945 he prepared the final manuscript of
the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, but, at the last minute,
withdrew it from publication (and only authorized its posthumous
publication). For a few more years he continued his philosophical work,
but this is marked by a rich development of, rather than a turn away
from, his second phase. He traveled during this period to the United
States and Ireland, and returned to Cambridge, where he was diagnosed
with cancer. Legend has it that, at his death in 1951, his last words
were &ldquo;Tell them I&rsquo;ve had a wonderful life&rdquo; (Monk: 579).</p>

<h2 id="EarlWitt">2. The Early Wittgenstein</h2>

<h3 id="TracLogiPhil">2.1 <em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em></h3>

<p>
<em>Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus</em> was first published in German
in 1921 and then translated&mdash;by C.K. Ogden, with
F. P. Ramsey&rsquo;s help&mdash;and published in English in 1922. It
was later re-translated by D.  F. Pears and B. F. McGuinness. Coming
out of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>Notes on Logic</em> (1913),
&ldquo;Notes Dictated to G. E. Moore&rdquo; (1914),
his <em>Notebooks</em>, written in 1914&ndash;16, and further correspondence
with Russell, Moore and Keynes, and showing Schopenhauerian and other
cultural influences, it evolved as a continuation of and reaction to
Russell and Frege&rsquo;s conceptions of logic and language. Russell
supplied an introduction to the book claiming that it &ldquo;certainly
deserves &hellip; to be considered an important event in the
philosophical world.&rdquo; It is fascinating to note that
Wittgenstein thought little of Russell&rsquo;s introduction, claiming
that it was riddled with misunderstandings. Later interpretations have
attempted to unearth the surprising tensions between the introduction
and the rest of the book (or between Russell&rsquo;s reading of
Wittgenstein and Wittgenstein&rsquo;s own
self-assessment)&mdash;usually harping on Russell&rsquo;s
appropriation of Wittgenstein for his own agenda. </p>

 
<p>

The <em>Tractatus</em>&rsquo;s structure purports to be representative of
its internal essence. It is constructed around seven basic
propositions, numbered by the natural numbers 1&ndash;7, with all other
paragraphs in the text numbered by decimal expansions so that, e.g.,
paragraph 1.1 is (supposed to be) a further elaboration on proposition
1, 1.22 is an elaboration of 1.2, and so on.</p>

<p>

The seven basic propositions are:</p>

<p>

Clearly, the book addresses the central problems of philosophy which
deal with the world, thought and language, and presents a &lsquo;solution&rsquo;
(as Wittgenstein terms it) of these problems that is grounded in logic
and in the nature of representation. The world is represented by
thought, which is a proposition with sense, since they all&mdash;world,
thought, and proposition&mdash;share the same logical form. Hence, the
thought and the proposition can be pictures of the facts.</p>

<p>

Starting with a seeming metaphysics, Wittgenstein sees the world as
consisting of facts (1), rather than the traditional, atomistic
conception of a world made up of objects. Facts are existent states of
affairs (2) and states of affairs, in turn, are combinations of
objects. &ldquo;Objects are simple&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em>
2.02) but objects can fit together in various determinate ways. They
may have various properties and may hold diverse relations to one
another.  Objects combine with one another according to their logical,
internal properties. That is to say, an object&rsquo;s internal properties
determine the possibilities of its combination with other objects;
this is its logical form. Thus, states of affairs, being comprised of
objects in combination, are inherently complex. The states of affairs
which do exist could have been otherwise. This means that states of
affairs are either actual (existent) or possible. It is the totality
of states of affairs&mdash;actual and possible&mdash;that makes up
the whole of reality.  The world is precisely those states of affairs
which do exist.</p>

<p>

The move to thought, and thereafter to language, is perpetrated with
the use of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s famous idea that thoughts, and propositions,
are pictures&mdash;&ldquo;the picture is a model of reality&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em>
2.12). Pictures are made up of elements that together constitute the
picture. Each element represents an object, and the combination of
elements in the picture represents the combination of objects in a
state of affairs. The logical structure of the picture, whether in
thought or in language, is isomorphic with the logical structure of
the state of affairs which it pictures. More subtle is Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
insight that the possibility of this structure being shared by the
picture (the thought, the proposition) and the state of affairs is the
pictorial form. &ldquo;<em>That</em> is how a picture is attached to
reality; it reaches right out to it&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 2.1511). This leads
to an understanding of what the picture can picture; but also what it
cannot&mdash;its own pictorial form.</p>

<p>

While &ldquo;the logical picture of the facts is the thought&rdquo; (3), in the
move to language Wittgenstein continues to investigate the
possibilities of significance for propositions (4). Logical analysis,
in the spirit of Frege and Russell, guides the work, with Wittgenstein
using logical calculus to carry out the construction of his system.
Explaining that &ldquo;Only the proposition has sense; only in the context of
a proposition has a name meaning&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 3.3), he provides the
reader with the two conditions for sensical language. First, the
structure of the proposition must conform to the constraints of
logical form, and second, the elements of the proposition must have
reference (<em>bedeutung</em>). These conditions have far-reaching
implications. The analysis must culminate with a name being a primitive
symbol for a (simple) object. Moreover, logic itself gives us the
structure and limits of what can be said at all.</p>

<p>

&ldquo;The general form of a proposition is: This is how things
stand&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 4.5) and every proposition is either true
or false. This bi-polarity of propositions enables the composition of
more complex propositions from atomic ones by using truth-functional
operators (5). Wittgenstein supplies, in the <em>Tractatus</em>, a
vivid presentation of Frege&rsquo;s logic in the form of what has become
known as &lsquo;truth-tables&rsquo;. This provides the means to go
back and analyze all propositions into their atomic parts, since
&ldquo;every statement about complexes can be analyzed into a
statement about their constituent parts, and into those propositions
which completely describe the complexes&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em>
2.0201). He delves even deeper by then providing the general form of a
truth-function (6). This form, \([\bar{p}, \bar{\xi}, N(\bar{\xi})]\),
makes use of one formal operation \((N(\bar{\xi}))\)
and one propositional variable \((\bar{p})\)
to represent Wittgenstein&rsquo;s claim that any proposition &ldquo;is the result
of successive applications&rdquo; of logical operations to elementary
propositions.</p>

<p>

Having developed this analysis of world-thought-language, and
relying on the one general form of the proposition, Wittgenstein can
now assert that all meaningful propositions are of equal value.
Subsequently, he ends the journey with the admonition concerning what
can (or cannot) and what should (or should not) be said (7), leaving
outside the realm of the sayable propositions of ethics, aesthetics,
and metaphysics.</p>

<h3 id="SensNons">2.2 Sense and Nonsense</h3>

<p>

In the <em>Tractatus</em> Wittgenstein&rsquo;s logical construction of a
philosophical system has a purpose&mdash;to find the limits of
world, thought and language; in other words, to distinguish between
sense and nonsense. &ldquo;The book will &hellip; draw a limit to thinking,
or rather&mdash;not to thinking, but to the expression of thoughts
&hellip;. The limit can &hellip; only be drawn in language and what
lies on the other side of the limit will be simply nonsense&rdquo;
(<em>TLP</em> Preface). The conditions for a proposition&rsquo;s having
sense have been explored and seen to rest on the possibility of
representation or picturing. Names must have a <em>bedeutung</em>
(reference/meaning), but they can only do so in the context of a
proposition which is held together by logical form. It follows that
only factual states of affairs which can be pictured can be
represented by meaningful propositions. This means that what can be
said are only propositions of natural science and leaves out of the
realm of sense a daunting number of statements which are made and used
in language.</p>

<p>

There are, first, the propositions of logic itself. These do not
represent states of affairs, and the logical constants do not stand
for objects.  &ldquo;My fundamental thought is that the logical
constants do not represent.  That the <em>logic</em> of the facts
cannot be represented&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 4.0312). This is not a
happenstance thought; it is fundamental precisely because the limits
of sense rest on logic.  Tautologies and contradictions, the
propositions of logic, are the limits of language and thought, and
thereby the limits of the world.  Obviously, then, they do not picture
anything and do not, therefore, have sense. They are, in
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s terms, senseless (<em>sinnlos</em>). Propositions which
do have sense are bipolar; they range within the truth-conditions
drawn by the truth-tables.  But the propositions of logic themselves
are &ldquo;not pictures of the reality &hellip; for the one
allows <em>every</em> possible state of affairs, the
other <em>none</em>&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 4.462). Indeed, tautologies
(and contradictions), being senseless, are recognized as true (or
false) &ldquo;in the symbol alone &hellip; and this fact contains in
itself the whole philosophy of logic&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 6.113).</p>

<p>

The characteristic of being senseless applies not only to the
propositions of logic but also to mathematics or the pictorial form itself of the
pictures that do represent. These are, like tautologies and
contradictions, literally sense-less, they have no sense.</p>

<p>

Beyond, or aside from, senseless propositions Wittgenstein identifies
another group of statements which cannot carry sense: the nonsensical
(<em>unsinnig</em>) propositions. Nonsense, as opposed to
senselessness, is encountered when a proposition is even more
radically devoid of meaning, when it transcends the bounds of
sense. Under the label of <em>unsinnig</em> can be found various
propositions: &ldquo;Socrates is identical&rdquo;, but also &ldquo;1
is a number&rdquo; and &ldquo;there are objects&rdquo;. While some
nonsensical propositions are blatantly so, others seem to be
meaningful&mdash;and only analysis carried out in accordance with the
picture theory can expose their nonsensicality. Since only what is
&ldquo;in&rdquo; the world can be described, anything that is
&ldquo;higher&rdquo; is excluded, including the notion of limit and
the limit points themselves. Traditional metaphysics, and the
propositions of ethics and aesthetics, which try to capture the world
as a whole, are also excluded, as is the truth in solipsism, the very
notion of a subject, for it is also not &ldquo;in&rdquo; the world but
at its limit.</p>

<p>

Wittgenstein does not, however, relegate all that is not inside the
bounds of sense to oblivion. He makes a distinction between
<em>saying</em> and <em>showing</em> which is made to do additional
crucial work. &ldquo;What can be shown cannot be said,&rdquo; that is,
what cannot be formulated in sayable (sensical) propositions can only
be shown. This applies, for example, to the logical form of the world,
the pictorial form, etc., which show themselves in the form of
(contingent) propositions, in the symbolism, and in logical
propositions. Even the unsayable (metaphysical, ethical, aesthetic)
propositions of philosophy belong in this group&mdash;which
Wittgenstein finally describes as &ldquo;things that cannot be put
into words. They make themselves manifest. They are what is
mystical&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 6.522).</p>

<h3 id="NatuPhil">2.3 The Nature of Philosophy</h3>

<p>

Accordingly, &ldquo;the word &lsquo;philosophy&rsquo; must mean something
which stands above or below, but not beside the natural sciences&rdquo;
(<em>TLP</em> 4.111). Not surprisingly, then, &ldquo;most of the
propositions and questions to be found in philosophical works are not
false but nonsensical&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 4.003). Is, then, philosophy
doomed to be nonsense (<em>unsinnig</em>), or, at best, senseless
(<em>sinnlos</em>) when it does logic, but, in any case, meaningless?
What is left for the philosopher to do, if traditional, or even
revolutionary, propositions of metaphysics, epistemology, aesthetics,
and ethics cannot be formulated in a sensical manner? The reply to
these two questions is found in Wittgenstein&rsquo;s characterization of
philosophy: philosophy is not a theory, or a doctrine, but rather an
activity. It is an activity of clarification (of thoughts), and more
so, of critique (of language).  Described by Wittgenstein, it should
be the philosopher&rsquo;s routine activity: to react or respond to the
traditional philosophers&rsquo; musings by showing them where they go wrong,
using the tools provided by logical analysis. In other words, by
showing them that (some of) their propositions are nonsense.</p>

<p>

&ldquo;All propositions are of equal value&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 6.4)&mdash;that
could also be the fundamental thought of the book. For it employs a
measure of the value of propositions that is done by logic and the
notion of limits. It is here, however, with the constraints on the
value of propositions, that the tension in the <em>Tractatus</em> is
most strongly felt. It becomes clear that the notions used by the
<em>Tractatus</em>&mdash;the logical-philosophical notions&mdash;do
not belong to the world and hence cannot be used to express anything
meaningful. Since language, thought and the world, are all isomorphic,
any attempt to say in logic (i.e., in language) &ldquo;this and this there
is in the world, that there is not&rdquo; is doomed to be a failure, since
it would mean that logic has got outside the limits of the world,
i.e. of itself. That is to say, the <em>Tractatus</em> has gone over
its own limits, and stands in danger of being nonsensical.</p>

<p>

The &ldquo;solution&rdquo; to this tension is found in Wittgenstein&rsquo;s final
remarks, where he uses the metaphor of the ladder to express the
function of the <em>Tractatus</em>. It is to be used in order to climb
on it, in order to &ldquo;see the world rightly&rdquo;; but thereafter it must be
recognized as nonsense and be thrown away. Hence: &ldquo;whereof one cannot
speak, thereof one must be silent&rdquo; (7).</p>

<h3 id="InteProb">2.4 Interpretative Problems</h3>

<p>

The <em>Tractatus</em> is notorious for its interpretative
difficulties. In the decades that have passed since its
publication it has gone through several waves of general
interpretations. Beyond exegetical and hermeneutical issues that
revolve around particular sections (such as the world/reality
distinction, the difference between representing and presenting, the
Frege/Russell connection to Wittgenstein, or the influence on
Wittgenstein by existentialist philosophy) there are a few
fundamental, not unrelated, disagreements that inform the map of
interpretation.  These revolve around the realism of the
<em>Tractatus</em>, the notion of nonsense and its role in reading the
<em>Tractatus</em> itself, and the reading of the <em>Tractatus</em>
as an ethical tract.</p>

<p>

There are interpretations that see the <em>Tractatus</em> as espousing
realism, i.e., as positing the independent existence of objects,
states of affairs, and facts. That this realism is achieved via a
linguistic turn is recognized by all (or most) interpreters, but this
linguistic perspective does no damage to the basic realism that is
seen to start off the <em>Tractatus</em> (&ldquo;The world is all that is
the case&rdquo;) and to run throughout the text (&ldquo;Objects form the substance
of the world&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 2.021)). Such realism is also taken to be
manifested in the essential bi-polarity of propositions; likewise, a
straightforward reading of the picturing relation posits objects there
to be represented by signs. As against these readings, more
linguistically oriented interpretations give conceptual priority to
the symbolism. When &ldquo;reality is compared with propositions&rdquo;
(<em>TLP</em> 4.05), it is the form of propositions which determines
the shape of reality (and not the other way round). In any case, the
issue of realism (vs. anti-realism) in the <em>Tractatus</em> must
address the question of the limits of language and the more particular
question of what there is (or is not) beyond language. Subsequently,
interpreters of the <em>Tractatus</em> have moved on to questioning
the very presence of metaphysics within the book and the status of the
propositions of the book themselves.</p>

<p>

&lsquo;Nonsense&rsquo; became the hinge of Wittgensteinian
interpretative discussion during the last decade of the 20th century.
Beyond the bounds of language lies nonsense&mdash;propositions which
cannot picture <em>anything</em>&mdash;and Wittgenstein bans
traditional metaphysics to that area. The quandary arises concerning
the question of what it is that inhabits that realm of nonsense, since
Wittgenstein does seem to be saying that there is something there to
be shown (rather than said) and does, indeed, characterize it as the
&lsquo;mystical&rsquo;. The traditional readings of the
<em>Tractatus</em> accepted, with varying degrees of discomfort, the
existence of that which is unsayable, that which cannot be put into
words, the nonsensical. More recent readings tend to take nonsense
more seriously as exactly that&mdash;nonsense. This also entails
taking seriously Wittgenstein&rsquo;s words in 6.54&mdash;his famous ladder
metaphor&mdash;and throwing out the <em>Tractatus</em> itself,
including the distinction between what can be said and what can only
be shown. The <em>Tractatus</em>, on this stance, does not point at
ineffable truths (of, e.g., metaphysics, ethics, aesthetics, etc.),
but should lead us away from such temptations.  An accompanying
discussion must then also deal with how this can be recognized, what
this can possibly mean, and how it should be used, if at all.</p>

<p>

This discussion is closely related to what has come to be called the
ethical reading of the <em>Tractatus</em>. Such a reading is based,
first, on the supposed discrepancy between Wittgenstein&rsquo;s construction
of a world-language system, which takes up the bulk of the
<em>Tractatus</em>, and several comments that are made about this
construction in the Preface to the book, in its closing remarks, and
in a letter he sent to his publisher, Ludwig von Ficker, before
publication. In these places, all of which can be viewed as external
to the content of the <em>Tractatus</em>, Wittgenstein preaches
silence as regards anything that is of importance, including the
&lsquo;internal&rsquo; parts of the book which contain, in his own
words, &ldquo;the final solution of the problems [of
philosophy].&rdquo; It is the importance given to the ineffable that
can be viewed as an ethical position. &ldquo;My work consists of two
parts, the one presented here plus all that I have <em>not</em>
written. And it is precisely this second part that is the important
point. For the ethical gets its limit drawn from the inside, as it
were, by my book; &hellip; I&rsquo;ve managed in my book to put everything
firmly into place by being silent about it &hellip;. For now I would
recommend you to read the <em>preface</em> and
the <em>conclusion</em>, because they contain the most direct
expression of the point&rdquo; (<em>ProtoTractatus</em>,
p.16). Obviously, such seemingly contradictory tensions within and
about a text&mdash;written by its author&mdash;give rise to
interpretative conundrums.</p>

<p>

There is another issue often debated by interpreters of Wittgenstein,
which arises out of the questions above. This has to do with the
continuity between the thought of the early and later
Wittgenstein. Again, the &lsquo;standard&rsquo; interpretations were
originally united in perceiving a clear break between the two distinct
stages of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s thought, even when ascertaining some
developmental continuity between them. And again, the more recent
interpretations challenge this standard, emphasizing that the
fundamental therapeutic motivation clearly found in the later
Wittgenstein should also be attributed to the early.</p>

<h2 id="LateWitt">3. The Later Wittgenstein</h2>

<h3 id="TranCritTrac">3.1 Transition and Critique of <em>Tractatus</em></h3>

<p>

The idea that philosophy is not a doctrine, and hence should not be
approached dogmatically, is one of the most important insights of the
<em>Tractatus</em>. Yet, as early as 1931, Wittgenstein referred to
his own early work as &lsquo;dogmatic&rsquo; (&ldquo;On
Dogmatism&rdquo; in <em>VC</em>, p. 182). Wittgenstein used this term
to designate any conception which allows for a gap between question
and answer, such that the answer to the question could be found at a
later date. The complex edifice of the <em>Tractatus</em> is built on
the assumption that the task of logical analysis was to discover the
elementary propositions, whose form was not yet known. What marks the
transition from early to later Wittgenstein can be summed up as the
<em>total</em> rejection of dogmatism, i.e., as the working out of
<em>all</em> the consequences of this rejection. The move from the
realm of logic to that of ordinary language as the center of the
philosopher&rsquo;s attention; from an emphasis on definition and analysis
to &lsquo;family resemblance&rsquo; and &lsquo;language-games&rsquo;;
and from systematic philosophical writing to an aphoristic
style&mdash;all have to do with this transition towards anti-dogmatism
in its extreme. It is in the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>
that the working out of the transitions comes to culmination. Other
writings of the same period, though, manifest the same anti-dogmatic
stance, as it is applied, e.g., to the philosophy of mathematics or to
philosophical psychology.</p>

<h3 id="PhilInve">3.2 <em>Philosophical Investigations</em></h3>

<p>
<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> was published posthumously in
1953. It was edited by G. E. M. Anscombe and Rush Rhees and translated
by Anscombe. It comprised two parts. Part I, consisting of 693
numbered paragraphs, was ready for printing in 1946, but rescinded
from the publisher by Wittgenstein. Part II was added on by the
editors, trustees of his <em>Nachlass</em>. In 2009 a new edited
translation, by P. M. S. Hacker and Joachim Schulte, was published;
Part II of the earlier translation was here labeled &ldquo;Philosophy
of Psychology &ndash; A Fragment&rdquo; (PPF).</p>

<p>

In the Preface to <em>PI</em>, Wittgenstein states that his new
thoughts would be better understood by contrast with and against the
background of his old thoughts, those in the <em>Tractatus</em>; and
indeed, most of Part I of <em>PI</em> is essentially critical. Its new
insights can be understood as primarily exposing fallacies in the
traditional way of thinking about language, truth, thought,
intentionality, and, perhaps mainly, philosophy. In this sense, it is
conceived of as a <em>therapeutic</em> work, viewing philosophy itself
as <em>therapy</em>. (Part II (PPF), focusing on philosophical psychology,
perception etc., was not as critical. Rather, it pointed to new
perspectives (which, undoubtedly, are not disconnected from the
earlier critique) in addressing specific philosophical issues.  It is,
therefore, more easily read alongside Wittgenstein&rsquo;s other writings of
the later period.)</p>

<p>

<em>PI</em> begins with a quote from Augustine&rsquo;s <em>Confessions</em>
which &ldquo;give us a particular picture of the essence of human language,&rdquo;
based on the idea that &ldquo;the words in language name objects,&rdquo;
and that &ldquo;sentences are combinations of such names&rdquo; (<em>PI</em>
1). This picture of language cannot be relied on as a basis for
metaphysical, epistemic or linguistic speculation. Despite its
plausibility, this reduction of language to representation cannot do
justice to the whole of human language; and even if it is to be
considered a picture of only the representative function of human
language, it is, as such, a poor picture. Furthermore, this picture of
language is at the base of the whole of traditional philosophy, but,
for Wittgenstein, it is to be shunned in favor of a new way of looking
at both language and philosophy. The <em>Philosophical
Investigations</em> proceeds to offer the new way of looking at
language, which will yield the view of philosophy as therapy.</p>

<h3 id="MeanUse">3.3 Meaning as Use</h3>

<p>

&ldquo;For a <em>large</em> class of cases of the employment of the
word &lsquo;meaning&rsquo;&mdash;though not for all&mdash;this word can
be explained in this way: the meaning of a word is its use in the
language&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 43). This basic statement is what
underlies the change of perspective most typical of the later phase of
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s thought: a change from a conception of meaning as
representation to a view which looks to use as the crux of the
investigation. Traditional theories of meaning in the history of
philosophy were intent on pointing to something exterior to the
proposition which endows it with sense. This &lsquo;something&rsquo;
could generally be located either in an objective space, or inside the
mind as mental representation. As early as 1933 (<em>The Blue
Book</em>) Wittgenstein took pains to challenge these conceptions,
arriving at the insight that &ldquo;if we had to name anything which
is the life of the sign, we should have to say that it was its
<em>use</em>&rdquo; (<em>BB</em> 4).  Ascertainment of the use (of a
word, of a proposition), however, is not given to any sort of
constructive theory building, as in the <em>Tractatus</em>. Rather,
when investigating meaning, the philosopher must &ldquo;look and
see&rdquo; the variety of uses to which the word is put. An analogy
with tools sheds light on the nature of words. When we think of tools
in a toolbox, we do not fail to see their variety; but the
&ldquo;functions of words are as diverse as the functions of these
objects&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 11). We are misled by the uniform
appearance of our words into theorizing upon meaning:
&ldquo;Especially when we are doing philosophy!&rdquo; (<em>PI</em>
12) </p>

<p>

So different is this new perspective that Wittgenstein repeats:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think, but look!&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 66); and such
looking is done <em>vis a vis</em> particular cases, not
generalizations. In giving the meaning of a word, any explanatory
generalization should be replaced by a description of use. The
traditional idea that a proposition houses a content and has a
restricted number of Fregean forces (such as assertion, question and
command), gives way to an emphasis on the diversity of uses. In order
to address the countless multiplicity of uses, their un-fixedness, and
their being part of an activity, Wittgenstein introduces the key
concept of &lsquo;language-game&rsquo;. He never explicitly defines it
since, as opposed to the earlier &lsquo;picture&rsquo;, for instance,
this new concept is made to do work for a more fluid, more
diversified, and more activity-oriented perspective on language.</p>

<h3 id="LangGameFamiRese">3.4 Language-games and Family Resemblance</h3>

<p>

Throughout the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, Wittgenstein
returns, again and again, to the concept of language-games to make
clear his lines of thought concerning language. Primitive
language-games are scrutinized for the insights they afford on this or
that characteristic of language. Thus, the builders&rsquo; language-game
(<em>PI</em> 2), in which a builder and his assistant use exactly four
terms (block, pillar, slab, beam), is utilized to illustrate that part
of the Augustinian picture of language which might be correct but
which is, nevertheless, strictly limited. &lsquo;Regular&rsquo;
language-games, such as the astonishing list provided in <em>PI</em>
23 (which includes, e.g., reporting an event, speculating about an
event, forming and testing a hypothesis, making up a story, reading
it, play-acting, singing catches, guessing riddles, making a joke,
translating, asking, thanking, and so on), bring out the openness of
our possibilities in using language and in describing it.</p>

<p>

Language-games are, first, a part of a broader context termed by
Wittgenstein a form of life (see below). Secondly, the concept of
language-games points at the rule-governed character of language. This
does not entail strict and definite systems of rules for each and
every language-game, but points to the conventional nature of this
sort of human activity. Still, just as we cannot give a final,
essential definition of &lsquo;game&rsquo;, so we cannot find
&ldquo;what is common to all these activities and what makes them into
language or parts of language&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 65).</p>

<p>

It is here that Wittgenstein&rsquo;s rejection of general explanations, and
definitions based on sufficient and necessary conditions, is best
pronounced. Instead of these symptoms of the philosopher&rsquo;s &ldquo;craving
for generality&rdquo;, he points to &lsquo;family resemblance&rsquo; as the
more suitable analogy for the means of connecting particular uses of
the same word. There is no reason to look, as we have done
traditionally&mdash;and dogmatically&mdash;for one, essential core
in which the meaning of a word is located and which is, therefore,
common to all uses of that word. We should, instead, travel with the
word&rsquo;s uses through &ldquo;a complicated network of similarities
overlapping and criss-crossing&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 66). Family resemblance
also serves to exhibit the lack of boundaries and the distance from
exactness that characterize different uses of the same concept. Such
boundaries and exactness are the definitive traits of form&mdash;be
it Platonic form, Aristotelian form, or the general form of a
proposition adumbrated in the <em>Tractatus</em>.  It is from such
forms that applications of concepts can be deduced, but this is
precisely what Wittgenstein now eschews in favor of appeal to
similarity of a kind with family resemblance.</p>

<h3 id="RuleFollPrivLang">3.5 Rule-following and Private Language</h3>

<p>

One of the issues most associated with the later Wittgenstein is that
of rule-following. Rising out of the considerations above, it becomes
another central point of discussion in the question of what it is that
can apply to all the uses of a word. The same dogmatic stance as before
has it that a rule is an abstract entity&mdash;transcending all of its
particular applications; knowing the rule involves grasping that
abstract entity and thereby knowing how to use it. </p>

<p>

Wittgenstein begins his exposition by introducing an example:
&ldquo;&hellip; we get [a] pupil to continue a series (say &lsquo;+
2&rsquo;) beyond 1000&mdash;and he writes 1000, 1004, 1008, 1012
(<em>PI</em> 185)&rdquo;. What do we do, and what does it mean, when
the student, upon being corrected, answers &ldquo;But I did go on in
the same way&rdquo;? Wittgenstein proceeds (mainly in <em>PI</em>
185&ndash;243, but also elsewhere) to dismantle the cluster of attendant
questions: How do we learn rules?  How do we follow them?  Wherefrom
the standards which decide if a rule is followed correctly?  Are they
in the mind, along with a mental representation of the rule?  Do we
appeal to intuition in their application? Are they socially and
publicly taught and enforced? In typical Wittgensteinian fashion, the
answers are not pursued positively; rather, the very formulation of
the questions as legitimate questions with coherent content is put to
the test. For indeed, it is both the Platonistic and mentalistic
pictures which underlie asking questions of this type, and
Wittgenstein is intent on freeing us from these assumptions. Such
liberation involves elimination of the need to posit any sort of
external or internal authority beyond the actual applications of the
rule.</p>

<p>

These considerations lead to <em>PI</em> 201, often considered the
climax of the issue: &ldquo;This was our paradox: no course of action
could be determined by a rule, because every course of action can be
made out to accord with the rule. The answer was: if everything can be
made out to accord with the rule, then it can also be made out to
conflict with it. And so there would be neither accord nor conflict
here.&rdquo; Wittgenstein&rsquo;s formulation of the problem, now at the
point of being a &ldquo;paradox&rdquo;, has given rise to a wealth of
interpretation and debate since it is clear to all that this is the
crux of the general issue of meaning, and of understanding and using a
language. One of the influential readings of the problem of following
a rule (introduced by Fogelin 1976 and Kripke 1982) has been the
interpretation, according to which Wittgenstein is here voicing a
skeptical paradox and offering a skeptical solution. That is to say,
there are no facts that determine what counts as following a rule, no
real grounds for saying that someone is indeed following a rule, and
Wittgenstein accepts this skeptical challenge (by suggesting other
conditions that might warrant our asserting that someone is following
a rule). This reading has been challenged, in turn, by several
interpretations (such as Baker and Hacker 1984, McGinn1984, and Cavell
1990), while others have provided additional, fresh perspectives
(e.g., Diamond, &ldquo;Rules: Looking in the Right Place&rdquo; in
Phillips and Winch 1989, and several in Miller and Wright 2002).</p>

<p>

Directly following the rule-following sections in
<em>PI</em>, and therefore easily thought to be the upshot of the
discussion, are those sections called by interpreters &ldquo;the
private-language argument&rdquo;. Whether it be a veritable argument
or not (and Wittgenstein never labeled it as such), these sections
point out that for an utterance to be meaningful it must be possible
in principle to subject it to public standards and criteria of
correctness. For this reason, a private-language, in which
&ldquo;words &hellip; are to refer to what only the speaker can
know&mdash;to his immediate private sensations &hellip;&rdquo;
(<em>PI</em> 243), is not a genuine, meaningful, rule-governed
language. The signs in language can only function when there is a
possibility of judging the correctness of their use, &ldquo;so the use
of [a] word stands in need of a justification which everybody
understands&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 261).</p>

<h3 id="GramFormLife">3.6 Grammar and Form of Life</h3>

<p>

Grammar, usually taken to consist of the rules of correct syntactic
and semantic usage, becomes, in Wittgenstein&rsquo;s hands, the
wider&mdash;and more elusive&mdash;network of rules which determine
what linguistic move is allowed as making sense, and what isn&rsquo;t. This
notion replaces the stricter and purer logic, which played such an
essential role in the
<em>Tractatus</em> in providing a scaffolding for language and the
world. Indeed, &ldquo;<em>Essence</em> is expressed in grammar
&hellip; Grammar tells what kind of object anything is.  (Theology as
grammar)&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 371, 373). The &ldquo;rules&rdquo; of
grammar are not mere technical instructions from on-high for correct
usage; rather, they express the norms for meaningful
language. Contrary to empirical statements, rules of grammar describe
how we use words in order to both justify and criticize our particular
utterances. But as opposed to grammar-book rules, they are not
idealized as an external system to be conformed to. Moreover, they are
not appealed to explicitly in any formulation, but are used in cases
of philosophical perplexity to clarify where language misleads us into
false illusions.  Thus, &ldquo;I can know what someone else is
thinking, not what I am thinking. It is correct to say &lsquo;I know
what you are thinking&rsquo;, and wrong to say &lsquo;I know what I am
thinking.&rsquo; (A whole cloud of philosophy condensed into a drop of
grammar.)&rdquo; (<em>Philosophical Investigations</em> 1953,
p.222).</p>

<p>

Grammar is not abstract, it is situated within the regular activity
with which language-games are interwoven: &ldquo;&hellip; the word
&lsquo;language-<em>game</em>&rsquo; is used here to emphasize the
fact that the <em>speaking</em> of language is part of an activity, or
of a form of life&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 23). What enables language to
function and therefore must be accepted as &ldquo;given&rdquo; are
precisely forms of life. In Wittgenstein&rsquo;s terms, &ldquo;It is not
only agreement in definitions but also (odd as it may sound) in
judgments that is required&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 242), and this is
&ldquo;agreement not in opinions, but rather in form of life&rdquo;
(<em>PI</em> 241). Used by Wittgenstein sparingly&mdash;five times in
the <em>Investigations</em>&mdash;this concept has given rise to
interpretative quandaries and subsequent contradictory readings. Forms
of life can be understood as changing and contingent, dependent on
culture, context, history, etc; this appeal to forms of life grounds a
relativistic reading of Wittgenstein. On the other hand, it is the
form of life common to humankind, &ldquo;shared human behavior&rdquo;
which is &ldquo;the system of reference by means of which we interpret
an unknown language&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 206). This might be seen as a
universalistic turn, recognizing that the use of language is made
possible by the human form of life.</p>

<h3 id="LateNatuPhil">3.7 The Nature of Philosophy</h3>

<p>

In his later writings Wittgenstein holds, as he did in
the <em>Tractatus</em>, that philosophers do not&mdash;or should
not&mdash;supply a theory, neither do they provide
explanations. &ldquo;Philosophy just puts everything before us, and
neither explains nor deduces anything.&mdash;Since everything lies
open to view there is nothing to explain&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 126). The
anti-theoretical stance is reminiscent of the early Wittgenstein, but
there are manifest differences. Although the <em>Tractatus</em>
precludes philosophical theories, it does construct a systematic
edifice which results in the general form of the proposition, all the
while relying on strict formal logic; the <em>Investigations</em>
points out the therapeutic non-dogmatic nature of philosophy, verily
instructing philosophers in the ways of therapy. &ldquo;The work of
the philosopher consists in marshalling reminders for a particular
purpose&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 127).  Working with reminders and series
of examples, different problems are solved. Unlike
the <em>Tractatus</em> which advanced one philosophical method, in
the <em>Investigations</em> &ldquo;there is not a single philosophical
method, though there are indeed methods, different therapies, as it
were&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 133d). This is directly related to
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s eschewal of <em>the</em> logical form or of any
a-priori generalization that can be discovered or made in
philosophy. Trying to advance such general theses is a temptation
which lures philosophers; but the real task of philosophy is both to
make us aware of the temptation and to show us how to overcome
it. Consequently &ldquo;a philosophical problem has the form: &lsquo;I
don&rsquo;t know my way about.&rsquo;&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 123), and hence
the aim of philosophy is &ldquo;to show the fly the way out of the
fly-bottle&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 309).</p>

<p>

The style of the <em>Investigations</em> is strikingly different from
that of the <em>Tractatus</em>. Instead of strictly numbered sections
which are organized hierarchically in programmatic order, the
<em>Investigations</em> fragmentarily voices aphorisms about
language-games, family resemblance, forms of life, &ldquo;sometimes
jumping, in a sudden change, from one area to another&rdquo;
(<em>PI</em> Preface). This variation in style is of course essential
and is &ldquo;connected with the very nature of the
investigation&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> Preface). As a matter of fact,
Wittgenstein was acutely aware of the contrast between the two stages
of his thought, suggesting publication of both texts together in order
to make the contrast obvious and clear.</p>

<p>

Still, it is precisely via the subject of the nature of philosophy
that the fundamental continuity between these two stages, rather than
the discrepancy between them, is to be found. In both cases philosophy
serves, first, as critique of language. It is through analyzing
language&rsquo;s illusive power that the philosopher can expose the traps of
meaningless philosophical formulations. This means that what was
formerly thought of as a philosophical problem may now dissolve &ldquo;and
this simply means that the philosophical problems should
<em>completely</em> disappear&rdquo; (<em>PI</em> 133). Two implications of
this diagnosis, easily traced back in the <em>Tractatus</em>, are to
be recognized. One is the inherent dialogical character of philosophy,
which is a responsive activity: difficulties and torments are
encountered which are then to be dissipated by philosophical therapy.
In the <em>Tractatus</em>, this took the shape of advice: &ldquo;The correct
method in philosophy would really be the following: to say nothing
except what can be said, i.e. propositions of natural science &hellip;
and then whenever someone else wanted to say something metaphysical,
to demonstrate to him that he had failed to give a meaning to certain
signs in his propositions&rdquo; (<em>TLP</em> 6.53) The second, more far-
reaching, &ldquo;discovery&rdquo; in the <em>Investigations</em> &ldquo;is the one that
enables me to break off philosophizing when I want to&rdquo;
(<em>PI</em> 133). This has been taken to revert back to the ladder
metaphor and the injunction to silence in the <em>Tractatus</em>.</p>

<h3 id="AfteInve">3.8 After the <em>Investigations</em></h3>

<p>

It has been submitted that the writings of the period from 1946 until
his death (1951) constitute a distinctive phase of Wittgenstein&rsquo;s
thought. These writings include, in addition to the second part of the
first edition of the <em>Philosophical Investigations</em>, texts
edited and collected in volumes such as <em>Remarks on
Colour</em>, <em>Remarks on the Philosophy of
Psychology</em>, <em>Zettel</em>, <em>On Certainty</em>, and parts
of <em>The Foundations of Mathematics</em>. Besides dealing with
mathematics and psychology, this is the stage at which Wittgenstein
most seriously pursued questions traditionally recognized as
epistemological. <em>On Certainty</em> tackles skeptical doubts and
foundational solutions but is, in typical Wittgensteinian fashion, a
work of therapy which discounts presuppositions common to both. This
is intimately related to another of <em>On Certainty</em>&rsquo;s
themes&mdash;the primacy of the deed to the word, or, in
Wittgenstein&rsquo;s <em>PI</em> terminology, of form of life to
grammar. The general tenor of all the writings of this last period can
thence be viewed as, on the one hand, a move away from the critical
(some would say destructive) positions of the
<em>Investigations</em> to a more positive perspective on the same
problems that had been facing him since his early writings; on the
other hand, this move does not constitute a break from the later
period but is more properly viewed as its continuation, in a new
light.</p>
